22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .
" it was a really nervous last lap because there 's always the fear that you crash or suffer a puncture or another mechanical problem , " said spitz , whose last major international triumph was her world title win in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spitz says she 's hungry for more spitz , who only started racing at the relatively late age of 22 , said that her age was of no concern .
she is getting hungrier all the time .
" it 's just a question of mind , i am still hungry , " she said .
" i feel pure joy at what i have finally achieved after so many years of hard work .
winning the gold medal at the olympic games is the crowning glory . "
no golds for germany on the water after many days of often surprising success , team germany 's paddlers suffered a disappointing penultimate day in beijing when a number of golden opportunities disappeared in the choppy waters of the shunyi olympic rowing-canoeing park .
christian gille and tomasz wylenzek took the bronze in a photo finish in the k2 500m division , just edging out the belarussian duo by 0.032 seconds .
china 's meng guanliang and yang wenjun were very popular winners of the race , just ahead of russians sergey ulegin and alexander kostoglod .
bildunterschrift : gille and wylenzek had to settle for bronze on saturday after friday 's silver in the women 's k2 over 500m , fanny fischer and nicole reinhardt left their surge forward until too late as hungarians katalin kovacs and natasa janic won gold in a time of one minute 41,308 seconds .
ronald rauhe and tim weiskotter won the silver in the k2 500m race , running eventual gold medalists saul craviotto and carlos perez of spain close at the finish .
in friday 's women 's k1 1,000m race katrin wagner-augustin claimed bronze behind inna osypenko-radomska of ukraine in first and josefa idem of italy in second place .
germany 's overall record at the shunyi park of two gold , two silver and three bronze medals was the poorest result the country had achieved in the sport since competing as a unified nation at the barcelona olympics in 1992 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 23.08.2008 west slammed for caucasus policy and kosovo recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that kosovo 's independence led to the events which caused the caucasus conflict romanian president traian basescu has strongly criticized the west 's policy on the caucasus , joining a growing number of voices which claim the west 's recognition of kosovo 's independence created the problem . after returning from a whirlwind trip to georgia and other countries in the region , basescu said friday , aug .
2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .

but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .

however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 23.08.2008 west slammed for caucasus policy and kosovo recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that kosovo 's independence led to the events which caused the caucasus conflict romanian president traian basescu has strongly criticized the west 's policy on the caucasus , joining a growing number of voices which claim the west 's recognition of kosovo 's independence created the problem . after returning from a whirlwind trip to georgia and other countries in the region , basescu said friday , aug .
2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 23.08.2008 west slammed for caucasus policy and kosovo recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that kosovo 's independence led to the events which caused the caucasus conflict romanian president traian basescu has strongly criticized the west 's policy on the caucasus , joining a growing number of voices which claim the west 's recognition of kosovo 's independence created the problem . after returning from a whirlwind trip to georgia and other countries in the region , basescu said friday , aug .
2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 23.08.2008 german politician : lecturing china wo n't improve human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daeubler-gmelin : applauding china for its achiements is better than constant criticism the olympics have raised awareness about human rights in china .
a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 23.08.2008 west slammed for caucasus policy and kosovo recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that kosovo 's independence led to the events which caused the caucasus conflict romanian president traian basescu has strongly criticized the west 's policy on the caucasus , joining a growing number of voices which claim the west 's recognition of kosovo 's independence created the problem . after returning from a whirlwind trip to georgia and other countries in the region , basescu said friday , aug .
2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .
" it was a really nervous last lap because there 's always the fear that you crash or suffer a puncture or another mechanical problem , " said spitz , whose last major international triumph was her world title win in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spitz says she 's hungry for more spitz , who only started racing at the relatively late age of 22 , said that her age was of no concern .
she is getting hungrier all the time .
" it 's just a question of mind , i am still hungry , " she said .
" i feel pure joy at what i have finally achieved after so many years of hard work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 23.08.2008 west slammed for caucasus policy and kosovo recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that kosovo 's independence led to the events which caused the caucasus conflict romanian president traian basescu has strongly criticized the west 's policy on the caucasus , joining a growing number of voices which claim the west 's recognition of kosovo 's independence created the problem . after returning from a whirlwind trip to georgia and other countries in the region , basescu said friday , aug .
2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

a sample of the eu 's food designation system . there is no better way to appreciate the sheer complexity of life in the eu than by looking at the types of food and drink it has taken under its wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .
finnish potatoes , istrian olive oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy topped the eu-designated foods list and the dish which is produced both furthest south and furthest east in the eu comes from the ancient village of geroskipou , on rocky cyprus , a place best known for its 1,200-year-old byzantine church .
its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .
that is by no means a record : hungary , slovenia and non-eu-member colombia also have one entry each -lrb- salami from szeged , olive oil from the istrian peninsula , colombian coffee -rrb- , while estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta have none at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 12 types of beer at the other end of the scale , italy has an impressive 169 entries .

a sample of the eu 's food designation system . there is no better way to appreciate the sheer complexity of life in the eu than by looking at the types of food and drink it has taken under its wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .
finnish potatoes , istrian olive oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy topped the eu-designated foods list and the dish which is produced both furthest south and furthest east in the eu comes from the ancient village of geroskipou , on rocky cyprus , a place best known for its 1,200-year-old byzantine church .
its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .
that is by no means a record : hungary , slovenia and non-eu-member colombia also have one entry each -lrb- salami from szeged , olive oil from the istrian peninsula , colombian coffee -rrb- , while estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta have none at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 12 types of beer at the other end of the scale , italy has an impressive 169 entries .

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .

georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .
russia 's two houses of parliament were due monday to discuss appeals from south ossetia and abkhazia for recognition from moscow , a move that would likely exacerbate the worst crisis between russia and the west since the end of the cold war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .

my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .
" it was a really nervous last lap because there 's always the fear that you crash or suffer a puncture or another mechanical problem , " said spitz , whose last major international triumph was her world title win in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spitz says she 's hungry for more spitz , who only started racing at the relatively late age of 22 , said that her age was of no concern .

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .
" it was a really nervous last lap because there 's always the fear that you crash or suffer a puncture or another mechanical problem , " said spitz , whose last major international triumph was her world title win in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spitz says she 's hungry for more spitz , who only started racing at the relatively late age of 22 , said that her age was of no concern .
she is getting hungrier all the time .
" it 's just a question of mind , i am still hungry , " she said .
" i feel pure joy at what i have finally achieved after so many years of hard work .

china 's meng guanliang and yang wenjun were very popular winners of the race , just ahead of russians sergey ulegin and alexander kostoglod .

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 23.08.2008 west slammed for caucasus policy and kosovo recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that kosovo 's independence led to the events which caused the caucasus conflict romanian president traian basescu has strongly criticized the west 's policy on the caucasus , joining a growing number of voices which claim the west 's recognition of kosovo 's independence created the problem . after returning from a whirlwind trip to georgia and other countries in the region , basescu said friday , aug .
2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 23.08.2008 european union makes a meal of regional treats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheeses are the most frequently protected food items in the eu what do you get if you take a potato , cover it with turkish delight , douse it in passion-fruit juice and serve with a wedge of soft goat cheese ?
a sample of the eu 's food designation system . there is no better way to appreciate the sheer complexity of life in the eu than by looking at the types of food and drink it has taken under its wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .
finnish potatoes , istrian olive oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy topped the eu-designated foods list and the dish which is produced both furthest south and furthest east in the eu comes from the ancient village of geroskipou , on rocky cyprus , a place best known for its 1,200-year-old byzantine church .
its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .
that is by no means a record : hungary , slovenia and non-eu-member colombia also have one entry each -lrb- salami from szeged , olive oil from the istrian peninsula , colombian coffee -rrb- , while estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta have none at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 12 types of beer at the other end of the scale , italy has an impressive 169 entries .
that includes 54 fruits , 38 types of olive oil and 34 cheeses .
south exceeds north in designations italy is followed by france , with 156 entries , then come spain , portugal and greece .
indeed , between them the mediterranean powers account for 628 of the 782 foods on the list - four fifths of all the entries .
by comparison , the eu 's northern members - britain , ireland , and the benelux and scandinavian states - have just 56 .
germany has 62 , of which 12 are beers and 24 are mineral waters .
it may , at least , explain why northern europeans complain that they can never reach their mediterranean colleagues at lunchtime .
and with the eu 's neighbors as keen as ever to get into the club , the one thing that seems certain is that the bloc 's menu is likely to get longer - and more complicated - with every course . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 23.08.2008 west slammed for caucasus policy and kosovo recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that kosovo 's independence led to the events which caused the caucasus conflict romanian president traian basescu has strongly criticized the west 's policy on the caucasus , joining a growing number of voices which claim the west 's recognition of kosovo 's independence created the problem . after returning from a whirlwind trip to georgia and other countries in the region , basescu said friday , aug .
2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

22 , from georgian territory to let georgian police regain control of the region . " the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time , " russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov said in a statement , according to afp news service .
" thus , the russian side has fulfilled ist obligations . " the georgian government confirmed friday that russia has pulled some troops out of key cities but is still manning checkpoints . " it is not true that the withdrawal is complete , " georgian government spokesman shota utiashvili told reporters . as a result , us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently holds the eu presidency , called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia . no compliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke with sarkozy on the phone " we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now , " gordon johndroe , a white house spokesman , said in crawford , texas , where bush is vacationing .
" they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory .
and they need to do that . " bush spoke on the telephone with sarkozy , who brokered the ceasefire agreement between russia and georgia on aug .
11 .
but russia has continued to position soldiers outside of the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and deep into georgian territory . british foreign secretary david miliband also said that he was " deeply concerned " by russia 's failure to completely withdraw from georgia . germany : humanitarian aid essential german government spokesman thomas steg on saturday also said that russia had apparently not completely withdrawn from georgia . " this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea . " nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said , according to a report by the interfax news agency .
" this does not contribute to stability in the region , " the colonel general added . the us destroyer uss mcfaul is currently on its way to georgia carrying aid supplies , passing the bosphorus on friday evening , accompanied by a polish naval vessel .
two more us naval vessels are scheduled to pass the straits off istanbul headed for the georgian coast in the coming days . several other nato naval vessels passed the straits into the black sea on thursday on their way to a naval exercise off the coasts of nato members bulgaria and romania in the western part of the sea .

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .

" this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea .

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .
russia 's two houses of parliament were due monday to discuss appeals from south ossetia and abkhazia for recognition from moscow , a move that would likely exacerbate the worst crisis between russia and the west since the end of the cold war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .
russia 's two houses of parliament were due monday to discuss appeals from south ossetia and abkhazia for recognition from moscow , a move that would likely exacerbate the worst crisis between russia and the west since the end of the cold war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .
russia 's two houses of parliament were due monday to discuss appeals from south ossetia and abkhazia for recognition from moscow , a move that would likely exacerbate the worst crisis between russia and the west since the end of the cold war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .
" it was a really nervous last lap because there 's always the fear that you crash or suffer a puncture or another mechanical problem , " said spitz , whose last major international triumph was her world title win in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spitz says she 's hungry for more spitz , who only started racing at the relatively late age of 22 , said that her age was of no concern .
she is getting hungrier all the time .
" it 's just a question of mind , i am still hungry , " she said .
" i feel pure joy at what i have finally achieved after so many years of hard work .
winning the gold medal at the olympic games is the crowning glory . "
no golds for germany on the water after many days of often surprising success , team germany 's paddlers suffered a disappointing penultimate day in beijing when a number of golden opportunities disappeared in the choppy waters of the shunyi olympic rowing-canoeing park .
christian gille and tomasz wylenzek took the bronze in a photo finish in the k2 500m division , just edging out the belarussian duo by 0.032 seconds .
china 's meng guanliang and yang wenjun were very popular winners of the race , just ahead of russians sergey ulegin and alexander kostoglod .

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , from georgian territory to let georgian police regain control of the region . " the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time , " russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov said in a statement , according to afp news service .
" thus , the russian side has fulfilled ist obligations . " the georgian government confirmed friday that russia has pulled some troops out of key cities but is still manning checkpoints . " it is not true that the withdrawal is complete , " georgian government spokesman shota utiashvili told reporters . as a result , us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently holds the eu presidency , called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia . no compliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke with sarkozy on the phone " we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now , " gordon johndroe , a white house spokesman , said in crawford , texas , where bush is vacationing .

" this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea . " nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said , according to a report by the interfax news agency .
" this does not contribute to stability in the region , " the colonel general added . the us destroyer uss mcfaul is currently on its way to georgia carrying aid supplies , passing the bosphorus on friday evening , accompanied by a polish naval vessel .
two more us naval vessels are scheduled to pass the straits off istanbul headed for the georgian coast in the coming days . several other nato naval vessels passed the straits into the black sea on thursday on their way to a naval exercise off the coasts of nato members bulgaria and romania in the western part of the sea .

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .

political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .
russia 's two houses of parliament were due monday to discuss appeals from south ossetia and abkhazia for recognition from moscow , a move that would likely exacerbate the worst crisis between russia and the west since the end of the cold war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" thus , the russian side has fulfilled ist obligations . " the georgian government confirmed friday that russia has pulled some troops out of key cities but is still manning checkpoints . " it is not true that the withdrawal is complete , " georgian government spokesman shota utiashvili told reporters . as a result , us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently holds the eu presidency , called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia . no compliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke with sarkozy on the phone " we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now , " gordon johndroe , a white house spokesman , said in crawford , texas , where bush is vacationing .

" this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea . " nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said , according to a report by the interfax news agency .
" this does not contribute to stability in the region , " the colonel general added . the us destroyer uss mcfaul is currently on its way to georgia carrying aid supplies , passing the bosphorus on friday evening , accompanied by a polish naval vessel .
two more us naval vessels are scheduled to pass the straits off istanbul headed for the georgian coast in the coming days . several other nato naval vessels passed the straits into the black sea on thursday on their way to a naval exercise off the coasts of nato members bulgaria and romania in the western part of the sea .

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .

it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 23.08.2008 west slammed for caucasus policy and kosovo recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that kosovo 's independence led to the events which caused the caucasus conflict romanian president traian basescu has strongly criticized the west 's policy on the caucasus , joining a growing number of voices which claim the west 's recognition of kosovo 's independence created the problem . after returning from a whirlwind trip to georgia and other countries in the region , basescu said friday , aug .
2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .
" it was a really nervous last lap because there 's always the fear that you crash or suffer a puncture or another mechanical problem , " said spitz , whose last major international triumph was her world title win in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spitz says she 's hungry for more spitz , who only started racing at the relatively late age of 22 , said that her age was of no concern .
she is getting hungrier all the time .
" it 's just a question of mind , i am still hungry , " she said .
" i feel pure joy at what i have finally achieved after so many years of hard work .

a sample of the eu 's food designation system . there is no better way to appreciate the sheer complexity of life in the eu than by looking at the types of food and drink it has taken under its wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .
finnish potatoes , istrian olive oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy topped the eu-designated foods list and the dish which is produced both furthest south and furthest east in the eu comes from the ancient village of geroskipou , on rocky cyprus , a place best known for its 1,200-year-old byzantine church .
its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .
that is by no means a record : hungary , slovenia and non-eu-member colombia also have one entry each -lrb- salami from szeged , olive oil from the istrian peninsula , colombian coffee -rrb- , while estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta have none at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 12 types of beer at the other end of the scale , italy has an impressive 169 entries .

a sample of the eu 's food designation system . there is no better way to appreciate the sheer complexity of life in the eu than by looking at the types of food and drink it has taken under its wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .
finnish potatoes , istrian olive oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy topped the eu-designated foods list and the dish which is produced both furthest south and furthest east in the eu comes from the ancient village of geroskipou , on rocky cyprus , a place best known for its 1,200-year-old byzantine church .
its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .
that is by no means a record : hungary , slovenia and non-eu-member colombia also have one entry each -lrb- salami from szeged , olive oil from the istrian peninsula , colombian coffee -rrb- , while estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta have none at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 12 types of beer at the other end of the scale , italy has an impressive 169 entries .
that includes 54 fruits , 38 types of olive oil and 34 cheeses .
south exceeds north in designations italy is followed by france , with 156 entries , then come spain , portugal and greece .
indeed , between them the mediterranean powers account for 628 of the 782 foods on the list - four fifths of all the entries .
by comparison , the eu 's northern members - britain , ireland , and the benelux and scandinavian states - have just 56 .
germany has 62 , of which 12 are beers and 24 are mineral waters .
it may , at least , explain why northern europeans complain that they can never reach their mediterranean colleagues at lunchtime .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .

its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .
that is by no means a record : hungary , slovenia and non-eu-member colombia also have one entry each -lrb- salami from szeged , olive oil from the istrian peninsula , colombian coffee -rrb- , while estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta have none at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 23.08.2008 german politician : lecturing china wo n't improve human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daeubler-gmelin : applauding china for its achiements is better than constant criticism the olympics have raised awareness about human rights in china .
a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , from georgian territory to let georgian police regain control of the region . " the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time , " russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov said in a statement , according to afp news service .
" thus , the russian side has fulfilled ist obligations . " the georgian government confirmed friday that russia has pulled some troops out of key cities but is still manning checkpoints . " it is not true that the withdrawal is complete , " georgian government spokesman shota utiashvili told reporters . as a result , us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently holds the eu presidency , called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia . no compliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke with sarkozy on the phone " we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now , " gordon johndroe , a white house spokesman , said in crawford , texas , where bush is vacationing .
" they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory .
and they need to do that . " bush spoke on the telephone with sarkozy , who brokered the ceasefire agreement between russia and georgia on aug .
11 .
but russia has continued to position soldiers outside of the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and deep into georgian territory . british foreign secretary david miliband also said that he was " deeply concerned " by russia 's failure to completely withdraw from georgia . germany : humanitarian aid essential german government spokesman thomas steg on saturday also said that russia had apparently not completely withdrawn from georgia . " this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea . " nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said , according to a report by the interfax news agency .
" this does not contribute to stability in the region , " the colonel general added . the us destroyer uss mcfaul is currently on its way to georgia carrying aid supplies , passing the bosphorus on friday evening , accompanied by a polish naval vessel .
two more us naval vessels are scheduled to pass the straits off istanbul headed for the georgian coast in the coming days . several other nato naval vessels passed the straits into the black sea on thursday on their way to a naval exercise off the coasts of nato members bulgaria and romania in the western part of the sea .

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .

the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .

" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .

the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .
" it was a really nervous last lap because there 's always the fear that you crash or suffer a puncture or another mechanical problem , " said spitz , whose last major international triumph was her world title win in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spitz says she 's hungry for more spitz , who only started racing at the relatively late age of 22 , said that her age was of no concern .
she is getting hungrier all the time .
" it 's just a question of mind , i am still hungry , " she said .
" i feel pure joy at what i have finally achieved after so many years of hard work .
winning the gold medal at the olympic games is the crowning glory . "
no golds for germany on the water after many days of often surprising success , team germany 's paddlers suffered a disappointing penultimate day in beijing when a number of golden opportunities disappeared in the choppy waters of the shunyi olympic rowing-canoeing park .
christian gille and tomasz wylenzek took the bronze in a photo finish in the k2 500m division , just edging out the belarussian duo by 0.032 seconds .
china 's meng guanliang and yang wenjun were very popular winners of the race , just ahead of russians sergey ulegin and alexander kostoglod .
bildunterschrift : gille and wylenzek had to settle for bronze on saturday after friday 's silver in the women 's k2 over 500m , fanny fischer and nicole reinhardt left their surge forward until too late as hungarians katalin kovacs and natasa janic won gold in a time of one minute 41,308 seconds .
ronald rauhe and tim weiskotter won the silver in the k2 500m race , running eventual gold medalists saul craviotto and carlos perez of spain close at the finish .
in friday 's women 's k1 1,000m race katrin wagner-augustin claimed bronze behind inna osypenko-radomska of ukraine in first and josefa idem of italy in second place .
germany 's overall record at the shunyi park of two gold , two silver and three bronze medals was the poorest result the country had achieved in the sport since competing as a unified nation at the barcelona olympics in 1992 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

" thus , the russian side has fulfilled ist obligations . " the georgian government confirmed friday that russia has pulled some troops out of key cities but is still manning checkpoints . " it is not true that the withdrawal is complete , " georgian government spokesman shota utiashvili told reporters . as a result , us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently holds the eu presidency , called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia . no compliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke with sarkozy on the phone " we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now , " gordon johndroe , a white house spokesman , said in crawford , texas , where bush is vacationing .

" this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea . " nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said , according to a report by the interfax news agency .
" this does not contribute to stability in the region , " the colonel general added . the us destroyer uss mcfaul is currently on its way to georgia carrying aid supplies , passing the bosphorus on friday evening , accompanied by a polish naval vessel .
two more us naval vessels are scheduled to pass the straits off istanbul headed for the georgian coast in the coming days . several other nato naval vessels passed the straits into the black sea on thursday on their way to a naval exercise off the coasts of nato members bulgaria and romania in the western part of the sea .

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .
russia 's two houses of parliament were due monday to discuss appeals from south ossetia and abkhazia for recognition from moscow , a move that would likely exacerbate the worst crisis between russia and the west since the end of the cold war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" thus , the russian side has fulfilled ist obligations . " the georgian government confirmed friday that russia has pulled some troops out of key cities but is still manning checkpoints . " it is not true that the withdrawal is complete , " georgian government spokesman shota utiashvili told reporters . as a result , us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently holds the eu presidency , called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia . no compliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke with sarkozy on the phone " we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now , " gordon johndroe , a white house spokesman , said in crawford , texas , where bush is vacationing .
" they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory .
and they need to do that . " bush spoke on the telephone with sarkozy , who brokered the ceasefire agreement between russia and georgia on aug .

but russia has continued to position soldiers outside of the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and deep into georgian territory . british foreign secretary david miliband also said that he was " deeply concerned " by russia 's failure to completely withdraw from georgia . germany : humanitarian aid essential german government spokesman thomas steg on saturday also said that russia had apparently not completely withdrawn from georgia . " this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea . " nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said , according to a report by the interfax news agency .
" this does not contribute to stability in the region , " the colonel general added . the us destroyer uss mcfaul is currently on its way to georgia carrying aid supplies , passing the bosphorus on friday evening , accompanied by a polish naval vessel .
two more us naval vessels are scheduled to pass the straits off istanbul headed for the georgian coast in the coming days . several other nato naval vessels passed the straits into the black sea on thursday on their way to a naval exercise off the coasts of nato members bulgaria and romania in the western part of the sea .

instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .
finnish potatoes , istrian olive oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy topped the eu-designated foods list and the dish which is produced both furthest south and furthest east in the eu comes from the ancient village of geroskipou , on rocky cyprus , a place best known for its 1,200-year-old byzantine church .
its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .
that is by no means a record : hungary , slovenia and non-eu-member colombia also have one entry each -lrb- salami from szeged , olive oil from the istrian peninsula , colombian coffee -rrb- , while estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta have none at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 12 types of beer at the other end of the scale , italy has an impressive 169 entries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 23.08.2008 german politician : lecturing china wo n't improve human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daeubler-gmelin : applauding china for its achiements is better than constant criticism the olympics have raised awareness about human rights in china .
a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a sample of the eu 's food designation system . there is no better way to appreciate the sheer complexity of life in the eu than by looking at the types of food and drink it has taken under its wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .
finnish potatoes , istrian olive oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy topped the eu-designated foods list and the dish which is produced both furthest south and furthest east in the eu comes from the ancient village of geroskipou , on rocky cyprus , a place best known for its 1,200-year-old byzantine church .
its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .

two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .
" it was a really nervous last lap because there 's always the fear that you crash or suffer a puncture or another mechanical problem , " said spitz , whose last major international triumph was her world title win in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spitz says she 's hungry for more spitz , who only started racing at the relatively late age of 22 , said that her age was of no concern .
she is getting hungrier all the time .
" it 's just a question of mind , i am still hungry , " she said .
" i feel pure joy at what i have finally achieved after so many years of hard work .
winning the gold medal at the olympic games is the crowning glory . "
no golds for germany on the water after many days of often surprising success , team germany 's paddlers suffered a disappointing penultimate day in beijing when a number of golden opportunities disappeared in the choppy waters of the shunyi olympic rowing-canoeing park .
christian gille and tomasz wylenzek took the bronze in a photo finish in the k2 500m division , just edging out the belarussian duo by 0.032 seconds .
china 's meng guanliang and yang wenjun were very popular winners of the race , just ahead of russians sergey ulegin and alexander kostoglod .
bildunterschrift : gille and wylenzek had to settle for bronze on saturday after friday 's silver in the women 's k2 over 500m , fanny fischer and nicole reinhardt left their surge forward until too late as hungarians katalin kovacs and natasa janic won gold in a time of one minute 41,308 seconds .
ronald rauhe and tim weiskotter won the silver in the k2 500m race , running eventual gold medalists saul craviotto and carlos perez of spain close at the finish .
in friday 's women 's k1 1,000m race katrin wagner-augustin claimed bronze behind inna osypenko-radomska of ukraine in first and josefa idem of italy in second place .
germany 's overall record at the shunyi park of two gold , two silver and three bronze medals was the poorest result the country had achieved in the sport since competing as a unified nation at the barcelona olympics in 1992 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , from georgian territory to let georgian police regain control of the region . " the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time , " russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov said in a statement , according to afp news service .
" thus , the russian side has fulfilled ist obligations . " the georgian government confirmed friday that russia has pulled some troops out of key cities but is still manning checkpoints . " it is not true that the withdrawal is complete , " georgian government spokesman shota utiashvili told reporters . as a result , us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently holds the eu presidency , called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia . no compliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke with sarkozy on the phone " we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now , " gordon johndroe , a white house spokesman , said in crawford , texas , where bush is vacationing .
" they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory .
and they need to do that . " bush spoke on the telephone with sarkozy , who brokered the ceasefire agreement between russia and georgia on aug .
11 .
but russia has continued to position soldiers outside of the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia and deep into georgian territory . british foreign secretary david miliband also said that he was " deeply concerned " by russia 's failure to completely withdraw from georgia . germany : humanitarian aid essential german government spokesman thomas steg on saturday also said that russia had apparently not completely withdrawn from georgia . " this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea . " nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said , according to a report by the interfax news agency .
" this does not contribute to stability in the region , " the colonel general added . the us destroyer uss mcfaul is currently on its way to georgia carrying aid supplies , passing the bosphorus on friday evening , accompanied by a polish naval vessel .
two more us naval vessels are scheduled to pass the straits off istanbul headed for the georgian coast in the coming days . several other nato naval vessels passed the straits into the black sea on thursday on their way to a naval exercise off the coasts of nato members bulgaria and romania in the western part of the sea .

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 23.08.2008 german politician : lecturing china wo n't improve human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daeubler-gmelin : applauding china for its achiements is better than constant criticism the olympics have raised awareness about human rights in china .
a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .
russia 's two houses of parliament were due monday to discuss appeals from south ossetia and abkhazia for recognition from moscow , a move that would likely exacerbate the worst crisis between russia and the west since the end of the cold war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
the single goal , shot by christopher zeller in the 19th minute , was enough to end the spirited challenge of the spanish .
germany could have had at least two more goals had it not been for spain 's goalie francisco cortes who denied matthias witthaus , and another german shot which hit the left goalpost .
in the women 's mountain biking final earlier in the day , sabine spitz , who ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of silver medalist maja wloszczowska of poland , was in a class of her own as she cycled away from her rivals early in the 27-kilometre course and had enough time to carry her bike across the finish line in delight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with time to spare , spitz could celebrate before the line " i thought the polish rider -lrb- wloszczowska -rrb- would have been stronger , " spitz said .
" after the first downhill i saw a chance to pass her and take the lead .
my aim was to shock my opponents in the race , but -lrb- for it -rrb- to happen that way was a big surprise . "
the 36-year old made her victory look easy , but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line .
" it was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading , so it took a lot of concentration , " spitz said .
" the heat was the strongest opponent .
i like the heat so maybe it was because of that that i won .
it was very hard because the weather was so hot today . "
the german provided a nervous moment on a downhill section on the last lap , but came through unscathed .

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .
it helps relations with china , but also human rights . interview : ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german media reports on saturday , aug .
2 , german bank ikb , a casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis , was sold to us private equity group lone star for 150 million euros -lrb- $ 222 million -rrb- . " according to informed sources , the amount -lrb- of the sale -rrb- is 150 million euros , " die welt newspaper said .
ikb had been rescued by state development bank kfw , which earlier this week did not disclose the sale price of its 91 percent stake in ikb .
kfw said only that it was a " low three digit million euro amount " - meaning presumably anything between 100-300 million euros .
ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business based in duesseldorf , invested heavily in securities tied to high risk subprime mortgages in the united states .
when us homeowners began defaulting on these home loans , these securities plunged in value and cost banks around the world hundreds of billions of dollars as they wrote off their investments .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , ikb was the first and biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage meltdown .
to prevent it going bankrupt it was bailed out to the tune of several billion euros gathered by the government , kfw and private german lenders .
a spokeswoman for the finance ministry , cited by several newspapers saturday , indicated that the state would carry a guarantee up to 600 million euros on any possible new losses by ikb .
dallas-based lone star saw off bids from swedish bank seb and fellow us private equity group ripplewood , sources said .
two state-owned german banks , bayernlb and westlb , were also interested but withdrew from the bidding .
the sale still needs to be approved by kfw 's supervisory board and by others including bafin , the german financial supervisory authority and the european commission . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .
those affected confirm this .
i think it 's now important that politicians help those who demand freedom rights , but that they also recognize the great things that have been accomplished and that are being accomplished .
there 's nothing wrong with praising the chinese athletes for organizing the olympic games .

22 , keeping their grip on a strategic port city , as moscow continued to brush aside western accusations it was failing to abide by a ceasefire deal . russia withdrew tanks , artillery and hundreds of troops from the heart of georgia on friday , saying it had now fulfilled all obligations under a french-brokered agreement aimed at ending the two-week-old conflict .
but russian troops were still controlling access to the western port of poti and also established a checkpoint just 10 kilometers -lrb- seven miles -rrb- north of the key city of gori , correspondents on the ground said .
britain , france and the united states have urged further withdrawals but a top russian general rejected the western criticism .
" all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france , " said general anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , in moscow .
he said russian troops would patrol and keep control over poti , georgia 's main commercial port .
russian troops first poured into georgia on august 8 to repel a georgian assault on the breakaway region of south ossetia , smashing the country 's small us-trained army .
they then fanned out through abkhazia , another pro-moscow breakaway region , and far into the georgian heartland .
russian soldiers backed up by four tanks were still in place on a bridge on the road heading from poti to the city of senaki further west and batumi to the south , an afp news agency correspondent reported .
port and security checkpoints still manned by russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are still in evidence around the port of poti some 500 georgians expressed outrage over the continued presence of russian troops in poti , going up to the post waving georgian flags and shouting " russians go home " .
" they want to keep these checkpoints , as we know , but they have no legal basis for it , " georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told the afp news agency .
two russian armored vehicles and lorries were saturday still controlling a checkpoint in the village of karaleti outside gori on the road to the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali .
the troops , whose uniform was marked with the insignia of peacekeepers , were not letting traffic further north without russian military accreditation .
they had erected concrete roadblocks and fenced off the area with razor-wire .
georgian police on friday retook control of gori and by saturday afternoon there were no russian checkpoints remaining on the east-west highway between tbilisi and the central city of khashuri .
full control of abkhazia and south ossetia bildunterschrift : moscow retains full control of abkhazia and south ossetia and says it has the right to establish an " area of responsibility " far beyond taking in stretches of the highway linking tbilisi to poti .
but the ex-soviet republic 's western backers told moscow overnight that it was violating the peace accord .
us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed during a telephone conversation that " russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now , " a white house spokesman said .
bush and sarkozy called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia , a statement from the french presidency added .
british foreign secretary david miliband also said he was " deeply concerned " and urged russia to stick " fully and speedily " to its obligations .
the speedy military victory over georgia , which is pressing for membership of nato , stunned western powers and since then the united states and nato have ratcheted up pressure on russia .
nato naval exercise increases tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato says the exercise was planned well before the crisis the latest focus of international tension was the black sea , where nato naval exercises are taking place and a us destroyer was due to arrive in georgia with what the pentagon says are humanitarian aid supplies .
nogovitsyn accused nato of boosting its naval presence " under the cover of delivering humanitarian goods , " pointing to the entrance of german , spanish and polish frigates into the black sea .
nato says the exercises were long pre-planned .
with its army humiliated and russian troops openly shielding the separatists in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia looks increasingly unlikely to recover its territory .
nogovitsyn warned the united states that russia could beef up its " peacekeeping " forces in georgia if washington helps tbilisi rebuild its army .
south ossetia 's separatist leader eduard kokoity was expected in moscow on saturday to present a demand for recognition of independence , itar-tass news agency reported .

a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herta daeubler-gmelin herta daeubler-gmelin is a social democratic member of parliament and heads the human rights and humanitarian affairs committee since 2005 .
she was germany 's justice minister from 1998 until 2002 . dw-world.de : the olympics were meant to bring human rights to china - were the games a charade in this respect ? herta daeubler-gmelin : i 've never demanded this from the olympics .
instead , the increased global publicity was meant to be used to find out more about china and remind beijing that human rights are part of a stable and democratic society everywhere in the world .
if you look at it this way , there have been good signs , but also serious deficits .
but it 's important for me that the question of human rights does n't drop off the agenda after the end of the olympic games . in 1968 , there was a legendary scene , when athletes highlighted the black civil rights movement by raising their fist in black gloves during the medal ceremony .
did you hope for more signs - or demonstrations - of solidarity by athletes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's undestandable that athletes do n't want to risk losing their medals , daeubler-gmelin says in 1968 , i thought that it was a great disgrace for the united states and the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to practically exclude from the games and strip of their medals the three athletes that gave the black panther salute at the podium .
it 's no surprise that athletes , who have prepared for four years to participate in the olympics , wo n't do something like that .
i also think that you should not ask too much of athletes .
it 's up to the journalists and politicians .
both have to live up to their responsibility , also by admonishing the ioc and sponsors to be more vigilant - but not only during the games , but also afterwards . how do you want to contribute to this as the chairwoman of the human rights committee in parliament ? we 'll be in beijing in october and carefully observe the human rights situation .
but i 'm against lecturing people .
those who do that in beijing do n't do it when talking to other great powers .
we should clearly and unequivocally demand human rights and we have to keep doing so , also as human rights activists and politicians . now that you 're going to china in october : how do you want to influence the chinese government when it comes to human rights , protecting minorities , democratization and the rule of law in the future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's boom has helped improve social human rights , daeubler-gmelin says the problem is that no one likes to be lectured to .
the same is true for -lrb- german interior minister -rrb- schaeuble and the human rights of foreigners , who are living in germany without papers .
but you can say things very clearly and make it clear that you 're watching what 's happening . but it 's always a good idea to notice progress as well .
human rights also include social human rights , meaning the right to education , to health care , to overcoming poverty .
sometimes it would be more useful for freedom rights - where china still has a lot to do - if people would recognize what kind of progress has been made in the last couple of years as far as social human rights are concerned . the olympics have increased awareness for human rights in china .
will anyone will be interested in the issue in six months ? this is a question for journalists .
what we have done - and i 've done this regularly since 1991 , not only in china , but also in other countries - will continue and it 's possible to see progress .

22 , from georgian territory to let georgian police regain control of the region . " the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time , " russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov said in a statement , according to afp news service .
" thus , the russian side has fulfilled ist obligations . " the georgian government confirmed friday that russia has pulled some troops out of key cities but is still manning checkpoints . " it is not true that the withdrawal is complete , " georgian government spokesman shota utiashvili told reporters . as a result , us president george w. bush and french president nicolas sarkozy , who currently holds the eu presidency , called on russia to " continue and complete " its withdrawal from georgia . no compliance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke with sarkozy on the phone " we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now , " gordon johndroe , a white house spokesman , said in crawford , texas , where bush is vacationing .
" they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory .
and they need to do that . " bush spoke on the telephone with sarkozy , who brokered the ceasefire agreement between russia and georgia on aug .

" this is also in line with the assessment of georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whom german chancellor angela merkel spoke with today , " he said . steg added that the german government expects russia to immediately complete the withdrawal according to the six-point ceasefire plan that was also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev . this includes pulling troops back into positions before the conflict with georgia erupted , clearing transportation ways between western and eastern georgia and restoring complete freedom of movement . " the german government expects that russian troops will also withdraw from the zone south of south ossetia and get replaced with an international mechanism as soon as possible , " steg said . he also said that getting humanitarian help to georgia and rebuilding regions destroyed by the war was of utmost importance . georgia wants international peacekeepers georgia 's president mikheil saakashvili meanwhile called for international peacekeepers in the conflict zone around the country 's two breakaway provinces , georgian media reported . " the preservation of georgia 's territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops , " saakashvili said at a meeting of the country 's national security council late friday . but the breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia are opposed to an international peacekeeping force , currently being discussed by the european union . russian forces have retreated from the central georgian city gori , but continued to control access to the important black sea port poti and other cities in western georgia and abkhazia , saakashvili said . caught by surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili got more than he bargained for moscow said friday that despite its withdrawal from central georgia , its forces would remain in buffer zones around south ossetia and abkhazia . saakashvili admitted that he had been surprised by the scale of russia 's response despite his own warnings of russia 's aggression . " i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion , " he was quoted as saying . some analysts say saakashvili provoked the kremlin by attacking south ossetia , which is under russian protection . russia slams nato presence the russian military on the other hand criticized the presence of nato naval vessels in the black sea . " nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said , according to a report by the interfax news agency .
" this does not contribute to stability in the region , " the colonel general added . the us destroyer uss mcfaul is currently on its way to georgia carrying aid supplies , passing the bosphorus on friday evening , accompanied by a polish naval vessel .
two more us naval vessels are scheduled to pass the straits off istanbul headed for the georgian coast in the coming days . several other nato naval vessels passed the straits into the black sea on thursday on their way to a naval exercise off the coasts of nato members bulgaria and romania in the western part of the sea .

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

2 that the existing peace mechanisms for the caucasus had proved inefficient and only maintained the tension .
he also said it was wrong to grant ethnic minorities collective territorial rights , specifically naming kosovo as an example .
" the problem that started with kosovo must be stopped , " the romanian president said .
his country has not recognized kosovo 's independence .
basescu said he wanted to convey his conclusions to romania 's partners in nato and the european union .
he also wanted to highlight his concern over the " frozen conflict " in romania 's neighbor , moldova , and its separatist region of transnistria .
the eu had to be more active in dealing with these conflicts , he stressed .
basescu said that in principle he was in favor of ethnic minority rights of a cultural nature , but only on an individual basis and never in conjunction with territories .
failure by the west to realize this would result in " big problems of territorial integrity " in the balkans , the black sea region and other parts of europe , basescu said .
basescu and foreign minister lazar comanescu embarked wednesday on a tour of five countries to review the georgian-russian conflict and its effects on the region .
in just two days , they visited ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan and turkey , meeting with their counterparts to review developments in the wake of the conflict in georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basecu , right , has had harsh words for nato and the west in kiev , basescu met ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to start a series of top-level meetings .
he also met moldovan president vladimir voronin , georgian president mikheil saakashvili , azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and turkish president abdullah gul .
basescu arrived in tbilisi on thursday accompanied by humanitarian aid to be distributed to displaced persons in georgia .
romania recently confirmed that it had provided weapons support to georgia 's infantry , with this assistance falling within international conventions .
at nato 's special foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday , comanescu stated that romania continued to support georgia 's aim to join the western alliance .
analysts link current crisis to kosovo 's independence basescu is not alone in linking the current problems in the caucasus to the west 's handling of kosovo , analysts believe that if russia recognizes georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia then the west 's backing of kosovo 's independence move this year will have played a key role .
bildunterschrift : abkhazia and south ossetia may take kosovo 's lead and claim independence russia 's upper house of parliament will meet in emergency session monday to discuss recognizing the independence of the rebel georgian regions .
in the abkhazian capital sukhumi on thursday tens of thousands of people thronged the main square urging moscow to back the bid for independence from tbilisi .
western nations have repeatedly championed georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity even as russian troops advanced to within 30 kilometers of the capital tbilisi .
however moscow argues that it has been protecting its nationals in peril abroad , as the united states , france and other western powers would do .
west recognition opened pandora 's box russian leaders also cite the example of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from russian ally serbia in april and has since been recognized by the united states and 20-odd european union nations among others .
" with the recognition of kosovo , they opened pandora 's box , " said dmitry rogozin , head of russia 's mission to nato .
western officials strongly reject the kosovo-south ossetia parallel .
" in kosovo there was a un presence , there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing , there was a standstill in negotiations , no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play , " one british diplomat said .
" i do n't think you can draw parallels . "
his foreign secretary david miliband puts the case more succinctly , describing the comparison as " completely bogus " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia was not happy about losing kosovo nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaks of " a special un trajectory for kosovo " which has been under united nations control since nato bombing in 1999 ousted serbian forces waging a crackdown on the ethnic-albanian separatists .
but for alain de neve , of belgium 's center for security and defense studies , moscow and tbilisi have made the connection even if the west does n't want to .
" without the issue of kosovo 's independence i do n't think that we would have seen this -lrb- georgia -rrb- story unfurl as quickly as it has , " he argues .
" those opposed to recognizing kosovo 's independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence .
but that provoked the intervention of one state , georgia , which wanted to keep control of all its territory , " de neve told the afp news agency .
kosovo link goes back to nato 's 1999 war thomas gomart of the french institute of international relations also believes that " the backdrop behind russia 's moves was the west 's behavior in kosovo , with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence ... despite moscow 's opposition . "
however in his opinion russia will nonetheless think twice before recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia fought a number of ugly wars to subdue chechnya just as russia was opposed to kosovo 's unilateral move it would not want to further encourage secessionist tendencies within the russian federation , such as the chechens , he said .
russia is " more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two -lrb- rebel georgian -rrb- regions , which would allow them to intervene when they wish . "
political science professor bruno coppieters thinks the georgia problem will eventually have to be sorted out as part of a wider solution .
" russia ca n't expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions .
" for their part western nations have n't got the means to put effective pressure on russia .
the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and , in the long term , there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council .

a sample of the eu 's food designation system . there is no better way to appreciate the sheer complexity of life in the eu than by looking at the types of food and drink it has taken under its wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .
finnish potatoes , istrian olive oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy topped the eu-designated foods list and the dish which is produced both furthest south and furthest east in the eu comes from the ancient village of geroskipou , on rocky cyprus , a place best known for its 1,200-year-old byzantine church .
its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .
that is by no means a record : hungary , slovenia and non-eu-member colombia also have one entry each -lrb- salami from szeged , olive oil from the istrian peninsula , colombian coffee -rrb- , while estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta have none at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 12 types of beer at the other end of the scale , italy has an impressive 169 entries .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek feta cheese has been protected since 2002 under the union 's protected designation of origin system , regions of the 27-member bloc that think that a food or drink produced in , and named after , their territory can protect the name .
that way only producers working in the region can use it .
one famous example is feta cheese : since 2002 , under eu rules , only sheep- and goat 's-milk cheese produced by a specific process and in specific parts of greece can be called " feta . "
cheese is the most protected food but in total the pdo system covers 782 types of food , ranging from arctic vegetables to mediterranean sweets - a classic example of the bewildering diversity that is the eu 's daily bread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : certain types of potatoes have been designated the most popular type of product listed is cheese , with 165 types under protection , from feta to a swedish cheese called svecia .
the second most popular is olive oil , with 97 listings .
the protected product which comes from the furthest north is the lapland potato , " lapin puikula , " which grows amidst the low hills , forests and swamps of arctic finland .
the westernmost protected delicacy , meanwhile , is a passion fruit , the " maracuja dos acores , " whose flowered vines grow aggressively in the near-tropical sun almost 1,200 kilometres out in the atlantic on the volcanic island of sao miguel , in the azores .

its local delicacy , a gelatinous sweet flavoured with lemon and rose petals -lrb- english-speakers would call it " turkish delight " -rrb- , is listed on the eu 's books as " loukoumi geroskipou . "
the finnish potato and the cypriot delight are each their country 's only pdo entry .

scientists have long wondered how stars develop in such extreme conditions .
molecular clouds - the normal birth places of stars - would be ripped apart by the immense gravity , a team explains in science magazine .
but the researchers say stars can form from elliptical discs - the relics of giant gas clouds torn apart by encounters with black holes .
they made the discovery after developing computer simulations of giant gas clouds being sucked into black holes like water spiralling down a plughole .
" these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy , " said co-author ian bonnell from st andrews university , uk .
ripped apart their findings are in accordance with actual observations in our milky way galaxy that indicate the presence of a massive black hole , surrounded by huge stars with eccentric orbits .
the simulations , performed on a supercomputer - and taking over a year of computing time - followed the evolution of two separate giant gas clouds up to 100,000 times the mass of the sun , as they fell towards the supermassive black hole .
the simulations show how the clouds are pulled apart by the immense gravitational pull of the black hole .
the disrupted clouds form into spiral patterns as they orbit the black hole ; the spiral patterns remove motion energy from gas that passes close to the black hole and transfers it to gas that passes further out .
this allows part of the cloud to be captured by the black hole while the rest escapes .
in these conditions , only high mass stars are able to form and these stars inherit the eccentric orbits from the elliptical disc .
these results match the two primary properties of the young stars in the centre of our galaxy : their high mass and their eccentric orbits around the supermassive black hole .
" that the stars currently present around the galaxy 's supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of -lsb- about -rsb- 10 million years , which suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive , " professor bonnell explained .

scientists have long wondered how stars develop in such extreme conditions .
molecular clouds - the normal birth places of stars - would be ripped apart by the immense gravity , a team explains in science magazine .
but the researchers say stars can form from elliptical discs - the relics of giant gas clouds torn apart by encounters with black holes .
they made the discovery after developing computer simulations of giant gas clouds being sucked into black holes like water spiralling down a plughole .
" these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy , " said co-author ian bonnell from st andrews university , uk .
ripped apart their findings are in accordance with actual observations in our milky way galaxy that indicate the presence of a massive black hole , surrounded by huge stars with eccentric orbits .
the simulations , performed on a supercomputer - and taking over a year of computing time - followed the evolution of two separate giant gas clouds up to 100,000 times the mass of the sun , as they fell towards the supermassive black hole .
the simulations show how the clouds are pulled apart by the immense gravitational pull of the black hole .
the disrupted clouds form into spiral patterns as they orbit the black hole ; the spiral patterns remove motion energy from gas that passes close to the black hole and transfers it to gas that passes further out .
this allows part of the cloud to be captured by the black hole while the rest escapes .
in these conditions , only high mass stars are able to form and these stars inherit the eccentric orbits from the elliptical disc .
these results match the two primary properties of the young stars in the centre of our galaxy : their high mass and their eccentric orbits around the supermassive black hole .
" that the stars currently present around the galaxy 's supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of -lsb- about -rsb- 10 million years , which suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive , " professor bonnell explained .

mr johnson , who is in china on an official visit to the beijing games , said british and london taxpayers would " not pay a penny more " .
his team was working on ways of economising without jeopardising the " legacy value " of the event , he added .
but olympic bosses said london still had to ensure the welfare of athletes .

" i think with british ingenuity , wit and ... resourcefulness we are going to produce a games - an opening ceremony , a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between - that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic , " he told bbc2 's newsnight . "

more than £ 2bn comes from lottery funding , more than £ 1bn from london council tax payers and £ 6bn from whitehall .
mr johnson said his team was currently economising and " finding ways of moving things around " and that the budget figure had " a couple of billion built in as contingency " .
" i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the £ 9.3bn.
i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that , " he said .
he added : " i will ensure that london taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more . "
mr johnson confirmed that security in 2012 would be a " big spend " , but he dismissed a price tag of £ 1bn , saying he had seen a figure of £ 600m .

" we are going to have a wonderful games and i can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for london taxpayers and that people coming to london will enjoy themselves , " he said .

" the games are for the athletes , the games are not for london , the games are not for great britain , " he added .

advertisement boris johnson on his hopes for the 2012 games mayor of london boris johnson has told the bbc he is " absolutely determined " the 2012 olympics will cost less than the current £ 9.3bn budget .
mr johnson , who is in china on an official visit to the beijing games , said british and london taxpayers would " not pay a penny more " .
his team was working on ways of economising without jeopardising the " legacy value " of the event , he added .
but olympic bosses said london still had to ensure the welfare of athletes .
asked whether 2012 would be the " austerity games " , mr johnson conceded that the chinese had put on " absolutely fantastic games " and that they had " set the bar high " .
" i think with british ingenuity , wit and ... resourcefulness we are going to produce a games - an opening ceremony , a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between - that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic , " he told bbc2 's newsnight .
i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the £ 9.3bn boris johnson mayor of london london handover plans revealed the original budget for the london olympics in 2005 was £ 3.4bn , but was increased to £ 9.3bn last year .
more than £ 2bn comes from lottery funding , more than £ 1bn from london council tax payers and £ 6bn from whitehall .
mr johnson said his team was currently economising and " finding ways of moving things around " and that the budget figure had " a couple of billion built in as contingency " .
" i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the £ 9.3bn.
i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that , " he said .
he added : " i will ensure that london taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more . "
mr johnson confirmed that security in 2012 would be a " big spend " , but he dismissed a price tag of £ 1bn , saying he had seen a figure of £ 600m .
' wonderful games ' mr johnson also said the loss of three senior officials from his administration in three months would not affect the delivery of the olympics .
" we are going to have a wonderful games and i can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for london taxpayers and that people coming to london will enjoy themselves , " he said .
mark wallace , of the taxpayers ' alliance , said he welcomed the fact that organisers were being strict with budgets .
the games are for the athletes , the games are not for london , the games are not for great britain jacques rogge international olympic committee " we do need to be firm on this .
we ca n't allow the olympic delivery authority , or whoever else involved with the games , simply to try and hold taxpayers to ransom . "
but jacques rogge , president of the international olympic committee , said london still had to deliver as well as china with regard to the quality of the olympic village , venues and transport .
" the games are for the athletes , the games are not for london , the games are not for great britain , " he added .
but mr johnson told bbc news athletes would not be " short-changed " at london 2012 .
" they are going to have a fantastic olympic village in which to spend their time during the games , " he said .

advertisement boris johnson on his hopes for the 2012 games mayor of london boris johnson has told the bbc he is " absolutely determined " the 2012 olympics will cost less than the current £ 9.3bn budget .
mr johnson , who is in china on an official visit to the beijing games , said british and london taxpayers would " not pay a penny more " .
his team was working on ways of economising without jeopardising the " legacy value " of the event , he added .
but olympic bosses said london still had to ensure the welfare of athletes .
asked whether 2012 would be the " austerity games " , mr johnson conceded that the chinese had put on " absolutely fantastic games " and that they had " set the bar high " .
" i think with british ingenuity , wit and ... resourcefulness we are going to produce a games - an opening ceremony , a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between - that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic , " he told bbc2 's newsnight .
i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the £ 9.3bn boris johnson mayor of london london handover plans revealed the original budget for the london olympics in 2005 was £ 3.4bn , but was increased to £ 9.3bn last year .
more than £ 2bn comes from lottery funding , more than £ 1bn from london council tax payers and £ 6bn from whitehall .
mr johnson said his team was currently economising and " finding ways of moving things around " and that the budget figure had " a couple of billion built in as contingency " .
" i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the £ 9.3bn.
i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that , " he said .
he added : " i will ensure that london taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more . "
mr johnson confirmed that security in 2012 would be a " big spend " , but he dismissed a price tag of £ 1bn , saying he had seen a figure of £ 600m .
' wonderful games ' mr johnson also said the loss of three senior officials from his administration in three months would not affect the delivery of the olympics .
" we are going to have a wonderful games and i can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for london taxpayers and that people coming to london will enjoy themselves , " he said .
mark wallace , of the taxpayers ' alliance , said he welcomed the fact that organisers were being strict with budgets .
the games are for the athletes , the games are not for london , the games are not for great britain jacques rogge international olympic committee " we do need to be firm on this .
we ca n't allow the olympic delivery authority , or whoever else involved with the games , simply to try and hold taxpayers to ransom . "
but jacques rogge , president of the international olympic committee , said london still had to deliver as well as china with regard to the quality of the olympic village , venues and transport .
" the games are for the athletes , the games are not for london , the games are not for great britain , " he added .
but mr johnson told bbc news athletes would not be " short-changed " at london 2012 .

the £ 1.6m system for the island in the small isles between skye and the ardnamurchan peninsula uses a mix of hydro , wind and solar power .
it went online for the first time in february .
maggie fyffe said it was working out far cheaper than diesel generators , which they previously relied on .
however , the generators were required for charging batteries in june when a spell of dry weather affected the productivity of hydro power schemes .
high voltage ms fyffe , secretary of isle of eigg heritage trust , said : " everything is working brilliantly and we are all overjoyed about how it has gone . "
she said among the benefits were reliability , not having the " rigmarole " of running generators and dealing with high fuel costs .
the operation of the project will be fully accessed around the point of the first anniversary of its launch .
it has been designed to generate more than 95 % of eigg 's annual energy demand and is backed up by a battery storage system and two diesel generators .
residents previously depended on diesel generators and hydro schemes .

dean sheikh , seven , from notting hill , west london , suffers from dyskeratosis congenita , which destroys the body 's immune system .
the rare condition currently affects only 38 people in the world .
farah ikbal urged asians to register with the african caribbean leukaemia trust , the carnival 's official charity . "
i 'm not a match for dean and there are not enough asian donors out there " farah ikbal , dean 's mother ms ikbal : " dean is a lovely sociable boy .
he is also very happy and very determined .
" a transplant would improve his quality of life .
he would n't have to go to hospital all the time and his immune system would be stronger .
" i 'm not a match for dean and there are not enough asian donors out there .
" now we are on a huge mission to find a person who can help save his life " .
ms ikbal said the condition has severly weakened dean 's immune system .
his condition has caused his nails and hair to degenerate and he has a life expectancy of five to eight years .
lack of donors the african caribbean leukaemia trust -lrb- aclt -rrb- said less than 3 % of registered potential donors of bone marrow and cord blood come from ethnic minorities , which makes finding a match difficult .
the charity uses the west london carnival to raise awareness of the lack of donors .
orin lewis , co-founder of aclt , said : " there are many more people like dean who are still desperately looking for a bone marrow match .
" we hope that revellers at the carnival will take the time to register as a donor before continuing with this year 's celebrations . "

farah ikbal urged asians to register with the african caribbean leukaemia trust , the carnival 's official charity .
i 'm not a match for dean and there are not enough asian donors out there farah ikbal , dean 's mother ms ikbal : " dean is a lovely sociable boy .
he is also very happy and very determined .
" a transplant would improve his quality of life .
he would n't have to go to hospital all the time and his immune system would be stronger .
" i 'm not a match for dean and there are not enough asian donors out there .
" now we are on a huge mission to find a person who can help save his life " .
ms ikbal said the condition has severly weakened dean 's immune system .
his condition has caused his nails and hair to degenerate and he has a life expectancy of five to eight years .
lack of donors the african caribbean leukaemia trust -lrb- aclt -rrb- said less than 3 % of registered potential donors of bone marrow and cord blood come from ethnic minorities , which makes finding a match difficult .
the charity uses the west london carnival to raise awareness of the lack of donors .
orin lewis , co-founder of aclt , said : " there are many more people like dean who are still desperately looking for a bone marrow match .
" we hope that revellers at the carnival will take the time to register as a donor before continuing with this year 's celebrations . "

she now needs an urgent hysterectomy , radiotherapy and chemotherapy , goody told the sun newspaper .
" i 'm fighting for my life .
i 've no control over this disease and i 'm bloody terrified , " she told the paper .
" i am going to fight the damn thing every step of the way because i have two beautiful boys who are my world , " she continued .

goody 's two boys are five-year-old bobby and three year-old freddie .
in the interview , goody also said how upset she had been by suggestions that her illness was a publicity stunt because she was appearing in the indian big brother , called bigg boss .

are viewers - and , more importantly , tv bosses - fed up with the endless parade of c- , d- and e-list names baring their souls in so-called reality shows ?
not according to those in the know at the edinburgh international television festival .
viewers have watched jodie marsh find a husband on screen and kerry katona give birth .
they 've seen jade goody abuse shilpa shetty and be told by big brother she has cancer -lrb- though not in the british version -rrb- .
they 've eavesdropped as the mother of all " reality " stars , sharon osbourne , invited tv cameras into a rock-star family home - letting them stay for three years - before reinventing herself as an x factor judge .
yet still they want more , we were told at a festival session called i 'm a celebrity - get me on tv ! .
' get me celebrities ' the panellists included osbourne herself , the publicist max clifford and the former editor of the celebrity magazine heat , mark frith .
" the world of celebrity has got bigger , " said frith .
" it 's the same in advertising , " added osbourne .
" they want a celebrity to advertise their product because it works . "
gok wan presented a special version of his show , for tv executives the executive producer of i 'm a celebrity ...
get me out of here ! went further .
" i have n't been into any meeting with any commissioner at any channel where they have n't said , ' get me a celebrity on this show , " ' said natalka znak , controller of factual entertainment at itv productions .
" it does n't matter what subject it is , or how serious the documentary , they say , ' i want a celebrity presenting it , " ' she said .
" that 's all people care about .
there 's so much competition for viewers , a celebrity might just make you watch something you would not ordinarily watch . "
the irony was not lost on the audience .
holocaust joke for the festival organisers have succumbed to the same obsession , luring ever more celebrities to edinburgh in recent years , to boost media attention .
this year they even appointed the celebrity pr firm taylor herring to maximise coverage .
the festival opened with the current king of tv fashion , gok wan , hosting a live edition of how to look good naked , featuring hapless tv executives in various stages of dress and undress .
richard and judy are among the stars lined up for the edinburgh tv festival next up was jamie oliver , giving the richard dunn memorial interview , where he managed to offend germans in the audience - and others - by making a veiled joke about the holocaust .
the interview was punctuated by a cookery lesson in which the one-time " naked chef " coached a " volunteer " from the audience .
surprise , surprise , it turned out to be sharon osbourne - who then took the stage in her own right , indulging in a spiky spat with max clifford in the celebrity session .
the dynamic duo kept the celeb-conscious journalists happy with some well-timed exclusives - osbourne revealing that she 'd love to appear on the next series of strictly come dancing ; clifford that he 'd signed up cycling 's triple-gold-medallist chris hoy and was seeking more olympic clients .
star line-up more celebs and tv spin-off shows are to come , as the festival unfolds over the weekend .
richard and judy are in conversation , fresh from their final show on channel 4 .
evan davis hosts three special editions of dragon 's den , while armando iannucci gives the alternative mactaggart lecture .
john humphrys will present a mastermind edinburgh special ; there 's an 8 out of 10 cats edinburgh special with jimmy carr ; and angus deayton is hosting a before they were famous edinburgh special .
anything , it seems , to enliven what might otherwise seem a succession of boring television executives .

are viewers - and , more importantly , tv bosses - fed up with the endless parade of c- , d- and e-list names baring their souls in so-called reality shows ?
not according to those in the know at the edinburgh international television festival .
viewers have watched jodie marsh find a husband on screen and kerry katona give birth .

yet still they want more , we were told at a festival session called i 'm a celebrity - get me on tv ! .
' get me celebrities ' the panellists included osbourne herself , the publicist max clifford and the former editor of the celebrity magazine heat , mark frith .

are viewers - and , more importantly , tv bosses - fed up with the endless parade of c- , d- and e-list names baring their souls in so-called reality shows ?
not according to those in the know at the edinburgh international television festival .
viewers have watched jodie marsh find a husband on screen and kerry katona give birth .
they 've seen jade goody abuse shilpa shetty and be told by big brother she has cancer -lrb- though not in the british version -rrb- .
they 've eavesdropped as the mother of all " reality " stars , sharon osbourne , invited tv cameras into a rock-star family home - letting them stay for three years - before reinventing herself as an x factor judge .
yet still they want more , we were told at a festival session called i 'm a celebrity - get me on tv ! .
' get me celebrities ' the panellists included osbourne herself , the publicist max clifford and the former editor of the celebrity magazine heat , mark frith .
" the world of celebrity has got bigger , " said frith .
" it 's the same in advertising , " added osbourne .
" they want a celebrity to advertise their product because it works . "
gok wan presented a special version of his show , for tv executives the executive producer of i 'm a celebrity ...
get me out of here ! went further .
" i have n't been into any meeting with any commissioner at any channel where they have n't said , ' get me a celebrity on this show , " ' said natalka znak , controller of factual entertainment at itv productions .
" it does n't matter what subject it is , or how serious the documentary , they say , ' i want a celebrity presenting it , " ' she said .
" that 's all people care about .
there 's so much competition for viewers , a celebrity might just make you watch something you would not ordinarily watch . "
the irony was not lost on the audience .
holocaust joke for the festival organisers have succumbed to the same obsession , luring ever more celebrities to edinburgh in recent years , to boost media attention .
this year they even appointed the celebrity pr firm taylor herring to maximise coverage .
the festival opened with the current king of tv fashion , gok wan , hosting a live edition of how to look good naked , featuring hapless tv executives in various stages of dress and undress .
richard and judy are among the stars lined up for the edinburgh tv festival next up was jamie oliver , giving the richard dunn memorial interview , where he managed to offend germans in the audience - and others - by making a veiled joke about the holocaust .
the interview was punctuated by a cookery lesson in which the one-time " naked chef " coached a " volunteer " from the audience .
surprise , surprise , it turned out to be sharon osbourne - who then took the stage in her own right , indulging in a spiky spat with max clifford in the celebrity session .
the dynamic duo kept the celeb-conscious journalists happy with some well-timed exclusives - osbourne revealing that she 'd love to appear on the next series of strictly come dancing ; clifford that he 'd signed up cycling 's triple-gold-medallist chris hoy and was seeking more olympic clients .
star line-up more celebs and tv spin-off shows are to come , as the festival unfolds over the weekend .
richard and judy are in conversation , fresh from their final show on channel 4 .
evan davis hosts three special editions of dragon 's den , while armando iannucci gives the alternative mactaggart lecture .
john humphrys will present a mastermind edinburgh special ; there 's an 8 out of 10 cats edinburgh special with jimmy carr ; and angus deayton is hosting a before they were famous edinburgh special .

grand buildings of the soviet era do not decay with dignity ; the cheap materials mean they just moulder .
stalin 's hometown of gori took a battering in the conflict the concrete walls of the former presidential palace which is eduard shevardnadze 's tbilisi home are streaked with water stains , the formal gardens as scruffy as the gaggle of soldiers guarding the gate .
he sits in a gloomy salon , surrounded by paintings in the socialist-realist style , and a wall full of photographs from his time as soviet foreign minister , with ronald reagan , margaret thatcher , helmut kohl and all the other big-wigs of those heady days , when he helped manage an end to the cold war .
he has slowed up with age , and remembering the twinkly energy which once made him such a star of summit doorsteps , i was saddened to find him so diminished .
the georgian attitude to mr shevardnadze is ambiguous .
they kicked him out of the presidency in a revolution , but he is their second most famous politician .
and even our fiercely modern , young translator wanted a photograph with the man she called " grandpa " .
unfinished business there is a similar ambiguity about the country 's most famous politician .
ask for a glass of the delicious georgian spring water called borjumi and you will be proudly told it was " stalin 's favourite drink " .
a heroic statue of that murderous dictator still stands in his home town of gori , which took such a battering in the recent conflict .
georgia 's past has returned to haunt its present and its future .
that conflict was a piece of unfinished business from the era which was book-ended by the careers of these two men .
stalin designed the caucasus in the messy way which has led to separatism .
and because the soviet empire collapsed with such speed and such minimal bloodshed - an achievement for which mr shevardnadze can certainly claim some credit - there was not time to tidy up the rough edges like south ossetia .
my hotel bedroom looked out on a panorama of tbilisi , and it struck me as a city running desperately to escape its past .
the impact of the war is not always obvious in tbilisi it is cradled by mountains , divided by a swift green river and studded with the distinctive round-towered churches which have been built about the place with an almost promiscuous enthusiasm .
but it is the new build that stands out , the office blocks and government buildings and the well-paved roads , that were busy even when the russians were a half-hour drive away .
and when you walk round the old quarter , you find many of the traditional town-houses , with their graceful wrought iron balconies , sinking into neglect .
human misery there is the same passion for modernity in the conversation of young georgians .
a 24-year-old woman waxed indignant about what she rather charmingly called the " institute of virginity " , by which she meant not some high-walled convent but georgian society 's strait-laced , sexual morality .
young georgians want to join the world of their contemporaries in the west - that is why mr saakashvili has been so popular - and they can not quite believe they have been caught up in something as old-fashioned as a war with russia .
georgian refugees find shelter in the capital tbilisi a young man in our hotel lobby - heading back home to gori - tried to cadge a lift off journalists .
he could not quite get his mind around the fact that what had been a routine journey had suddenly become so dangerous .
the veneer of modernity means the impact of the war is not always obvious in tbilisi .
i saw no ragged and defeated soldiers on the streets , no columns of refugees .
but scratch away at the surface and there is old-fashioned human misery .
we found 1,000 refugees who had taken over a former military hospital .
it seemed to have been abandoned until their arrival , and walking the cold , echoing corridors with their peeling plaster it was easy to see why .
there was no water or sanitation , no food and nothing to cook on .
almost all of the people there were sleeping on concrete floors .
most of them were georgians from south ossetia .
the chances that they will see their villages there again are very slight indeed .
becoming part of history the violence of the conflict and russia 's subsequent statements on south ossetia and the other breakaway area , abkhazia , make the possibility that those regions will remain part of georgia very remote , and none of these people will return to live under russian influence .
instead they will keep their memories ; memories , they said , of being bombed by russian planes and watching their ossetian neighbours loot their homes .
one woman described giving tea to georgian troops in her kitchen as they advanced and then seeing the same soldiers retreat wounded and carrying their dead .
another spoke of beheadings by south ossetian irregulars .
whether or not all these stories are true does not , in a way , matter .
they are believed by the people who hear them , and they are becoming part of georgia 's history .
history is back in georgia , the past that belongs to this country 's most famous sons - stalin and shevardnadze - is coming alive again .

ask for a glass of the delicious georgian spring water called borjumi and you will be proudly told it was " stalin 's favourite drink " .
a heroic statue of that murderous dictator still stands in his home town of gori , which took such a battering in the recent conflict .
georgia 's past has returned to haunt its present and its future .
that conflict was a piece of unfinished business from the era which was book-ended by the careers of these two men .
stalin designed the caucasus in the messy way which has led to separatism .
and because the soviet empire collapsed with such speed and such minimal bloodshed - an achievement for which mr shevardnadze can certainly claim some credit - there was not time to tidy up the rough edges like south ossetia .
my hotel bedroom looked out on a panorama of tbilisi , and it struck me as a city running desperately to escape its past .
the impact of the war is not always obvious in tbilisi it is cradled by mountains , divided by a swift green river and studded with the distinctive round-towered churches which have been built about the place with an almost promiscuous enthusiasm .
but it is the new build that stands out , the office blocks and government buildings and the well-paved roads , that were busy even when the russians were a half-hour drive away .
and when you walk round the old quarter , you find many of the traditional town-houses , with their graceful wrought iron balconies , sinking into neglect .
human misery there is the same passion for modernity in the conversation of young georgians .
a 24-year-old woman waxed indignant about what she rather charmingly called the " institute of virginity " , by which she meant not some high-walled convent but georgian society 's strait-laced , sexual morality .
young georgians want to join the world of their contemporaries in the west - that is why mr saakashvili has been so popular - and they can not quite believe they have been caught up in something as old-fashioned as a war with russia .
georgian refugees find shelter in the capital tbilisi a young man in our hotel lobby - heading back home to gori - tried to cadge a lift off journalists .
he could not quite get his mind around the fact that what had been a routine journey had suddenly become so dangerous .
the veneer of modernity means the impact of the war is not always obvious in tbilisi .
i saw no ragged and defeated soldiers on the streets , no columns of refugees .
but scratch away at the surface and there is old-fashioned human misery .
we found 1,000 refugees who had taken over a former military hospital .
it seemed to have been abandoned until their arrival , and walking the cold , echoing corridors with their peeling plaster it was easy to see why .
there was no water or sanitation , no food and nothing to cook on .
almost all of the people there were sleeping on concrete floors .
most of them were georgians from south ossetia .
the chances that they will see their villages there again are very slight indeed .
becoming part of history the violence of the conflict and russia 's subsequent statements on south ossetia and the other breakaway area , abkhazia , make the possibility that those regions will remain part of georgia very remote , and none of these people will return to live under russian influence .
instead they will keep their memories ; memories , they said , of being bombed by russian planes and watching their ossetian neighbours loot their homes .
one woman described giving tea to georgian troops in her kitchen as they advanced and then seeing the same soldiers retreat wounded and carrying their dead .
another spoke of beheadings by south ossetian irregulars .
whether or not all these stories are true does not , in a way , matter .
they are believed by the people who hear them , and they are becoming part of georgia 's history .
history is back in georgia , the past that belongs to this country 's most famous sons - stalin and shevardnadze - is coming alive again .
