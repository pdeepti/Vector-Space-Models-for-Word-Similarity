program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.08.2008 indian surrogacy in the eye of the storm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emiko yamada looks at her 11-day-old granddaughter manji yamada , born to an indian surrogate mother surrogacy has been in the news recently because of a spate of commercial surrogacies in india .
the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .
i would say if it is a free contract between consenting adults it should not be a matter of breast beating . ’ ’
presently , there are no clear strictures regarding commercial surrogacy in india .
fearing that the country could become what she calls a “ cheap-deal-hub ” for surrogacy , the women and child development minister renuka chaudhary has called for stronger laws against the practice .
but dr kadam feels such fears are unfounded : “ i think we would be overreacting .
commercial surrogacy is very new and within a very short span of time it has gained a lot of importance . ”
the complicated case of manji yamada one case that has attracted huge media attention is that of manji yamada .
born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .
he and his wife divorced shortly before manji 's birth .
the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’
but even if manji can not yet leave indian shores , the supreme court has allowed her to be under the care of her grandmother emiko yamada , who has travelled to india .
although there are no clear statistics about the exact number of surrogate mothers and babies born per year , experts estimate there could be hundreds in india .

the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .
i would say if it is a free contract between consenting adults it should not be a matter of breast beating . ’ ’
presently , there are no clear strictures regarding commercial surrogacy in india .
fearing that the country could become what she calls a “ cheap-deal-hub ” for surrogacy , the women and child development minister renuka chaudhary has called for stronger laws against the practice .
but dr kadam feels such fears are unfounded : “ i think we would be overreacting .
commercial surrogacy is very new and within a very short span of time it has gained a lot of importance . ”
the complicated case of manji yamada one case that has attracted huge media attention is that of manji yamada .
born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .
he and his wife divorced shortly before manji 's birth .
the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’
but even if manji can not yet leave indian shores , the supreme court has allowed her to be under the care of her grandmother emiko yamada , who has travelled to india .
although there are no clear statistics about the exact number of surrogate mothers and babies born per year , experts estimate there could be hundreds in india .

" before the race my coach told me you need to swim your own race and that the others would start very fast , " she said .
" i decided to close my eyes and just go for it and i think it worked quite well . " after touching the pad in a time of 53.12 , she did not turn around to look at the results board , embracing trickett , who had swum in the lane next to hers instead . " at that moment i did not really know what had happened , " steffen said .
" i just wanted to enjoy the moment and i thought that even if i did not win a medal , i swam a wonderful race .
but then when i looked at the board i saw that i had won and everything was brilliant . " steffen said after her victory that credit must go to psychologist friederike janofske , with whom she has been working for a long time . " she has managed to bring out the best in me , " she said . the 24-year-old said that she thinks it also helped her that the german swim team had - so far - bombed out at the olympics . " there was very little pressure on me , " she said .
" my world record was gone , i had not done well in the relay and nobody really thought i was going to win a medal . bildunterschrift : steffen disappointed at the 2000 olympics , but friday showed that she has what it takes gold for three us swimmers superstar michael phelps set the benchmark for overall medals a little bit higher when he won his sixth gold medal of the competition and his 12th gold overall , to go three clear of four athletes with nine all-time olympic golds . phelps took his world record tally to six with his victory in the men 's 200-meter individual medley in a time of 1:54.23 seconds . american ryan lochte won the men 's 200-meter backstroke in a world record time of 1:53.94 - just 20 minutes before winning bronze in the 200 im - while fellow american rebecca soni took the women 's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:20.22 seconds , also in world record time . in the men 's 200-meter im , the medals went to the same swimmers who also stood on the podium in the same order for the 400-meter im , with phelps being followed by hungarian laszlo cseh and lochte . phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.80 that he established at the us trials last month . " i just wanted to step on it in the first 50-meter a little bit and try to get out to an early lead , " he said .
" i knew that it was a hard double for ryan -lrb- lochte -rrb- .

both nations are split by staunch political beliefs . war in georgia has divided the people of latvia and estonia , two ex-soviet nations where russian speakers are the largest ethnic minority .
rival loyalties , never far below the surface , surged into the open as baltic leaders sided with georgia 's us-backed president , mikheil saakashvili , based on a shared history of oppression by moscow .
" saakhashvili is an inappropriate president , " said valentina smorodina , 75 , an ethnic russian who came to latvia after world war ii from russia .
" they ought to put him on trial and shoot him . "
" the latvian government should be ashamed for supporting him , " she told dpa news agency at her home in bolderaja , a mostly russian neighborhood in the latvian capital , riga , where a former soviet naval barracks sits empty .
here , she resides in a parallel universe that has little to do with latvia .
like many others , she watches kremlin-sponsored television news and reads local russian newspapers , which support russia 's military assault in georgia .
passionage supporters and protestors as russia and georgia engage in propaganda wars in the international media , russians and latvians are split over the conflict 2,200 kilometers -lrb- 1,367 miles -rrb- away .
demonstrators in all three baltic nations - estonia , latvia and lithuania - have held pro-georgia rallies since the conflict erupted last week .
mostly ethnic estonians , latvians , and lithuanians protested outside russian embassies in their capitals , calling on russia to cease what they called " aggression " against a neighbor .
latvia 's russian minority , which accounts for about a third of its 2.3 million people , staged its own rally in support of moscow 's actions in georgia .
holding signs " russia , you 're right " and " russia is a bulwark of peace , " several hundred mostly ethnic russians gathered this week outside the russian embassy in the latvian capital , riga , two days after several thousands had come out to offer support to georgia and condemn russia .
a history of war as baltic governments offer political and humanitarian assistance to georgia , ethnic russians ask for blood and clothing donations for victims in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia .
history helps explain why baltic leaders offered to help georgia .
soviet tanks crushed 22 years of baltic independence in 1940 , deporting estonians , latvians and lithuanians to siberian gulags .
after a three-year german occupation during world war ii , the soviets regained control of the baltics until communism crumbled in 1990 .
so a resurgent russia flexing its military muscle near its border in georgia gives balts a sense of deja-vu .
" my father jokingly asked , ' to which country would you be moving if the russians come ? ' said latvian woman ilze murniece , 32 .
as another sign of a divide , the harmony center , one out of two parties representing ethnic russians in the latvian parliament , boycotted a debate on the situation in georgia on thursday .
another party , for humans rights in united latvia , had sharp words ahead of the vote to condemn russia 's behavior in georgia .
" i hope that you 'll remember the advice of former french president jacques chirac that there are moments when it 's better for latvia to keep silent , " said jakovs pliners , referring to chirac 's reaction to the new eu members , including latvia , support for the us invasion in iraq in 2003 .
" the way russia throws its weight around clearly should make everyone a little upset , " estonian president toomas hendrik ilves told dpa in a phone interview from tallinn .
in response , tech-savvy estonia sent experts to help divert cyber attacks on georgian servers , after estonian servers were attacked in a dispute with russia in 2007 .
latvia 's government set aside 100,000 lats -lrb- 143,500 euros , $ 212,000 -rrb- in aid to georgia .
leaders of the three baltic states , poland and ukraine traveled to georgia this week to show support .
condemning russia the baltics present themselves as examples of transformation from former soviet republics into members of the european union and nato , which the three countries joined in 2004 .
they have been sharing their experience with georgia and supported its bid to join nato .
not all latvians support georgia , but they do widely condemn russia 's actions .
" yes , i blame both sides , " said latvian university student ainars leijejs , who organized small protests at the georgian and russian embassies .
" but there is no doubt that russia today is the first and biggest aggressor and enemy of a world in peace . " dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three former raf terrorists convicted in the 1977 murder of attorney general siegfried buback wo n't have to serve an additional sentence for refusing to give further testimony in the case , ruled germany 's highest court . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe decided friday , aug .
15 , that former red army faction terrorists christian klar , brigitte mohnhaupt and knut folkerts would not receive an added prison sentence of up to six months , thus overturning a ruling by the investigating judge . all three members of the left-wing terrorist group , which was active in germany in the 1970s and 1980s , were convicted for taking part in the murder of buback and his two companions . had the additional sentence been upheld , klar 's time in prison would have been extended .
mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .

it 's the first time the group has gotten involved to help resolve a kidnapping . according to the german foreign ministry , two german workers kidnapped in nigeria over a month ago have now been released .
in a statement issued friday , aug .
15 , ministry spokesman andreas peschke said the two are receiving medical treatment and are doing well " considering the circumstances " and are in " good physical condition . " " the federal government is very relieved by their release , " he added .
employed by julius berger , a local affiliate of german construction company bilfinger berger , the two germans were kidnapped on july 11 at emohua in rivers state in the niger delta , an area notorious for kidnappings .
around 15 unidentified gunmen travelling in armored jeeps accompanied by 28 soldiers seized the workers of the country 's largest construction firm .
the violent kidnappings prompted julius berger to suspend all of its operations in the delta .
despite the safe release of its workers , the company is sticking to its decision to pull out of the area , a spokesperson for the company told dpa news agency .
act of kindness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mend is responsible for several attacks on oil companies operating in the area nigeria 's most prominent militant group , the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta -lrb- mend -rrb- rescued the hostages from the armed gang on thursday , reported reuters news service .
itself responsible for numerous attacks on oil companies that have consequently cut a fifth of nigeria 's oil output since early 2006 , mend released the germans near the oil hub port harcourt .
the group , which had announced about a week after the kidnappings that it had identified those responsible and would work to free the hostages , was reportedly motivated to intervene because the two germans were not employed in the energy sector , but rather were helping to build the delta 's infrastructure .
big player in nigeria the company julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta .
with more than 16,000 employees , it is one of the country 's biggest private sector employers .
according to reuters , mend 's rescue operation that concluded with the safe release of the german workers was the first time it had intervened in an act of kidnapping committed by another gang .
foreign companies weigh profits against inherent dangers an alarmingly dangerous area for foreigners , more than 200 people have been kidnapped in the niger delta since early 2006 .

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . on sunday , merkel will also visit tbilisi for talks with georgian president mikheil saakashvili . dw staff -lrb- sp / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three former raf terrorists convicted in the 1977 murder of attorney general siegfried buback wo n't have to serve an additional sentence for refusing to give further testimony in the case , ruled germany 's highest court . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe decided friday , aug .
15 , that former red army faction terrorists christian klar , brigitte mohnhaupt and knut folkerts would not receive an added prison sentence of up to six months , thus overturning a ruling by the investigating judge . all three members of the left-wing terrorist group , which was active in germany in the 1970s and 1980s , were convicted for taking part in the murder of buback and his two companions . had the additional sentence been upheld , klar 's time in prison would have been extended .
mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .
it remains highly disputed whether former members of terrorist organizations can be forced to testify against fellow members after having served their sentence . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first time the group has gotten involved to help resolve a kidnapping . according to the german foreign ministry , two german workers kidnapped in nigeria over a month ago have now been released .
in a statement issued friday , aug .
15 , ministry spokesman andreas peschke said the two are receiving medical treatment and are doing well " considering the circumstances " and are in " good physical condition . " " the federal government is very relieved by their release , " he added .
employed by julius berger , a local affiliate of german construction company bilfinger berger , the two germans were kidnapped on july 11 at emohua in rivers state in the niger delta , an area notorious for kidnappings .
around 15 unidentified gunmen travelling in armored jeeps accompanied by 28 soldiers seized the workers of the country 's largest construction firm .
the violent kidnappings prompted julius berger to suspend all of its operations in the delta .
despite the safe release of its workers , the company is sticking to its decision to pull out of the area , a spokesperson for the company told dpa news agency .

itself responsible for numerous attacks on oil companies that have consequently cut a fifth of nigeria 's oil output since early 2006 , mend released the germans near the oil hub port harcourt .
the group , which had announced about a week after the kidnappings that it had identified those responsible and would work to free the hostages , was reportedly motivated to intervene because the two germans were not employed in the energy sector , but rather were helping to build the delta 's infrastructure .
big player in nigeria the company julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta .
with more than 16,000 employees , it is one of the country 's biggest private sector employers .
according to reuters , mend 's rescue operation that concluded with the safe release of the german workers was the first time it had intervened in an act of kidnapping committed by another gang .
foreign companies weigh profits against inherent dangers an alarmingly dangerous area for foreigners , more than 200 people have been kidnapped in the niger delta since early 2006 .
such security problems have prompted numerous foreign firms to pull out of the area , reports afp .

three former raf terrorists convicted in the 1977 murder of attorney general siegfried buback wo n't have to serve an additional sentence for refusing to give further testimony in the case , ruled germany 's highest court . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe decided friday , aug .
15 , that former red army faction terrorists christian klar , brigitte mohnhaupt and knut folkerts would not receive an added prison sentence of up to six months , thus overturning a ruling by the investigating judge . all three members of the left-wing terrorist group , which was active in germany in the 1970s and 1980s , were convicted for taking part in the murder of buback and his two companions . had the additional sentence been upheld , klar 's time in prison would have been extended .
mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .

15 , but the change of coach from the experienced ottmar hitzfeld to 44-year-old klinsmann could provide an opportunity for the bavarians ' leading rivals . bayern won last year 's title at a trot , enjoying a 10-point gap over second-placed werder bremen , and klinsmann can rely on basically the same set of players with the exception of veteran goalkeeper oliver kahn , who has retired , has been replaced by the young michael rensing . unlike last season 's 70 million euro -lrb- $ 104 million -rrb- shopping spree , munich have foregone the transfer market for the 2008-09 season .
midfielder tim borowski , arriving on a free transfer from bremen , is the only newcomer of note .
instead the club has splurged on former international striker klinsmann and his coaching staff . stars on the bayern bench klinsmann , who took germany to third place in the 2006 world cup , wants a swifter , more attacking game from bayern , but it may take time for his methods to bear fruit and could open up opportunities for the likes of bremen and schalke . bayern 's pre-season form has been patchy , with training marked by injuries and the late arrival of their euro 2008 internationals . bayern 's opener against hamburg on friday will also be marked by prominent holes in the star-studded lineup .. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern stars ribery and toni wo n't be playing against hamburg striker luca toni , midfielder franck ribery , defenders willy sagnol , martin demichelis and midfielder hamit altintop have all been ruled out against hamburg while argentina midfielder jose ernesto sosa and brazilian defender breno are away competing for their national teams at the olympics . bayern struggled to overcome third division rot-weiss erfurt in the german cup on sunday , but klinsmann said he was confident of an improvement before his team takes the field against hamburg . " we have worked on the mistakes against erfurt , " he said .
" we have done a lot in the tactical area and what 's only lacking now is the fine-tuning . " hamburg , who finished fourth last season , also start with a new coach , 52-year-old dutchman martin jol , who played nine games for bayern in the 1978-79 season . jol has to compensate for the loss of dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart to real madrid , but the northern side have looked solid in pre-season matches and put up a decent show at the recently concluded emirates cup in london against real madrid and juventus . " bayern have had a few problems with their preparations and we have some good results despite one two small difficulties , " jol said .
" we know they 've got some player problems .
ribery is out , and toni , demichelis and sagnol are also injured , but we 've also seen that they 've got other good players .

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .

" the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .

15 , but the change of coach from the experienced ottmar hitzfeld to 44-year-old klinsmann could provide an opportunity for the bavarians ' leading rivals . bayern won last year 's title at a trot , enjoying a 10-point gap over second-placed werder bremen , and klinsmann can rely on basically the same set of players with the exception of veteran goalkeeper oliver kahn , who has retired , has been replaced by the young michael rensing . unlike last season 's 70 million euro -lrb- $ 104 million -rrb- shopping spree , munich have foregone the transfer market for the 2008-09 season .
midfielder tim borowski , arriving on a free transfer from bremen , is the only newcomer of note .
instead the club has splurged on former international striker klinsmann and his coaching staff . stars on the bayern bench klinsmann , who took germany to third place in the 2006 world cup , wants a swifter , more attacking game from bayern , but it may take time for his methods to bear fruit and could open up opportunities for the likes of bremen and schalke . bayern 's pre-season form has been patchy , with training marked by injuries and the late arrival of their euro 2008 internationals . bayern 's opener against hamburg on friday will also be marked by prominent holes in the star-studded lineup .. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern stars ribery and toni wo n't be playing against hamburg striker luca toni , midfielder franck ribery , defenders willy sagnol , martin demichelis and midfielder hamit altintop have all been ruled out against hamburg while argentina midfielder jose ernesto sosa and brazilian defender breno are away competing for their national teams at the olympics . bayern struggled to overcome third division rot-weiss erfurt in the german cup on sunday , but klinsmann said he was confident of an improvement before his team takes the field against hamburg . " we have worked on the mistakes against erfurt , " he said .
" we have done a lot in the tactical area and what 's only lacking now is the fine-tuning . " hamburg , who finished fourth last season , also start with a new coach , 52-year-old dutchman martin jol , who played nine games for bayern in the 1978-79 season . jol has to compensate for the loss of dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart to real madrid , but the northern side have looked solid in pre-season matches and put up a decent show at the recently concluded emirates cup in london against real madrid and juventus . " bayern have had a few problems with their preparations and we have some good results despite one two small difficulties , " jol said .
" we know they 've got some player problems .
ribery is out , and toni , demichelis and sagnol are also injured , but we 've also seen that they 've got other good players . " bremen confident , schalke hopes to end drought meanwhile bremen 's brazilian defender naldo believes the club is better placed than last season to challenge for the title . " the team is top fit , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" unlike last season we have no injury complaints apart from per mertesacker . " germany defender mertesacker , who suffered a cartilage injury in training that required surgery , will be sidelined for several weeks .
bremen are also missing brazil midfielder diego , who is at the olympics , for their game saturday against arminia bielefeld . schalke , who placed third last season , begin the season on saturday at home against hanover under new dutch coach fred rutten .
the side will be hoping to end their 50-year title drought - the last time they lifted a league trophy was in the pre-bundesliga era . gelsenkirchen too may be without peru striker jefferson farfan , a major new signing along with dutch midfielder orlando engelaar , who suffered a shoulder injury in the 1-0 victory wednesday against atletico madrid in a champions league qualifying match . all eyes on hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim and its famous millionare club owner , sap 's dietmar hopp have created a stir with their promotion wolfsburg , who finished fifth last term , take on newly-promoted cologne at home , having spent more than 25 million euros on new players . bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund duel under new coaches , with bruno labbadia now in charge at leverkusen and juergen klopp on the bench at dortmund . in other matches saturday , promoted hoffenheim are at energie cottbus , and karlsruhe take on bochum . sunday 's matches see eintracht frankfurt battle hertha berlin while promoted borussia moenchenglach meet vfb stuttgart . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first time the group has gotten involved to help resolve a kidnapping . according to the german foreign ministry , two german workers kidnapped in nigeria over a month ago have now been released .
in a statement issued friday , aug .
15 , ministry spokesman andreas peschke said the two are receiving medical treatment and are doing well " considering the circumstances " and are in " good physical condition . " " the federal government is very relieved by their release , " he added .
employed by julius berger , a local affiliate of german construction company bilfinger berger , the two germans were kidnapped on july 11 at emohua in rivers state in the niger delta , an area notorious for kidnappings .
around 15 unidentified gunmen travelling in armored jeeps accompanied by 28 soldiers seized the workers of the country 's largest construction firm .
the violent kidnappings prompted julius berger to suspend all of its operations in the delta .
despite the safe release of its workers , the company is sticking to its decision to pull out of the area , a spokesperson for the company told dpa news agency .
act of kindness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mend is responsible for several attacks on oil companies operating in the area nigeria 's most prominent militant group , the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta -lrb- mend -rrb- rescued the hostages from the armed gang on thursday , reported reuters news service .
itself responsible for numerous attacks on oil companies that have consequently cut a fifth of nigeria 's oil output since early 2006 , mend released the germans near the oil hub port harcourt .
the group , which had announced about a week after the kidnappings that it had identified those responsible and would work to free the hostages , was reportedly motivated to intervene because the two germans were not employed in the energy sector , but rather were helping to build the delta 's infrastructure .
big player in nigeria the company julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta .
with more than 16,000 employees , it is one of the country 's biggest private sector employers .
according to reuters , mend 's rescue operation that concluded with the safe release of the german workers was the first time it had intervened in an act of kidnapping committed by another gang .
foreign companies weigh profits against inherent dangers an alarmingly dangerous area for foreigners , more than 200 people have been kidnapped in the niger delta since early 2006 .
such security problems have prompted numerous foreign firms to pull out of the area , reports afp .
almost all of the people seized in the niger delta to this point , however , have been freed unharmed . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .

the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both nations are split by staunch political beliefs . war in georgia has divided the people of latvia and estonia , two ex-soviet nations where russian speakers are the largest ethnic minority .
rival loyalties , never far below the surface , surged into the open as baltic leaders sided with georgia 's us-backed president , mikheil saakashvili , based on a shared history of oppression by moscow .
" saakhashvili is an inappropriate president , " said valentina smorodina , 75 , an ethnic russian who came to latvia after world war ii from russia .
" they ought to put him on trial and shoot him . "
" the latvian government should be ashamed for supporting him , " she told dpa news agency at her home in bolderaja , a mostly russian neighborhood in the latvian capital , riga , where a former soviet naval barracks sits empty .
here , she resides in a parallel universe that has little to do with latvia .
like many others , she watches kremlin-sponsored television news and reads local russian newspapers , which support russia 's military assault in georgia .
passionage supporters and protestors as russia and georgia engage in propaganda wars in the international media , russians and latvians are split over the conflict 2,200 kilometers -lrb- 1,367 miles -rrb- away .
demonstrators in all three baltic nations - estonia , latvia and lithuania - have held pro-georgia rallies since the conflict erupted last week .
mostly ethnic estonians , latvians , and lithuanians protested outside russian embassies in their capitals , calling on russia to cease what they called " aggression " against a neighbor .
latvia 's russian minority , which accounts for about a third of its 2.3 million people , staged its own rally in support of moscow 's actions in georgia .
holding signs " russia , you 're right " and " russia is a bulwark of peace , " several hundred mostly ethnic russians gathered this week outside the russian embassy in the latvian capital , riga , two days after several thousands had come out to offer support to georgia and condemn russia .
a history of war as baltic governments offer political and humanitarian assistance to georgia , ethnic russians ask for blood and clothing donations for victims in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia .
history helps explain why baltic leaders offered to help georgia .
soviet tanks crushed 22 years of baltic independence in 1940 , deporting estonians , latvians and lithuanians to siberian gulags .
after a three-year german occupation during world war ii , the soviets regained control of the baltics until communism crumbled in 1990 .
so a resurgent russia flexing its military muscle near its border in georgia gives balts a sense of deja-vu .
" my father jokingly asked , ' to which country would you be moving if the russians come ? ' said latvian woman ilze murniece , 32 .
as another sign of a divide , the harmony center , one out of two parties representing ethnic russians in the latvian parliament , boycotted a debate on the situation in georgia on thursday .
another party , for humans rights in united latvia , had sharp words ahead of the vote to condemn russia 's behavior in georgia .
" i hope that you 'll remember the advice of former french president jacques chirac that there are moments when it 's better for latvia to keep silent , " said jakovs pliners , referring to chirac 's reaction to the new eu members , including latvia , support for the us invasion in iraq in 2003 .
" the way russia throws its weight around clearly should make everyone a little upset , " estonian president toomas hendrik ilves told dpa in a phone interview from tallinn .
in response , tech-savvy estonia sent experts to help divert cyber attacks on georgian servers , after estonian servers were attacked in a dispute with russia in 2007 .

dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .
russia would continue discussions on the issue with " all actors , " the president said , while warning that the us move did not contribute to calm .
merkel insisted the shield was not directed at russia but was rather protection against countries like iran .
missile deal makes poland a target , says military chief this was not the view from the kremlin which reiterated its belief that the shield was aimed at moscow while a russian military spokesperson went further by saying that washington 's deal with warsaw made poland " 100 percent " a target for russia 's military .
" the agreement 's content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia , " the interfax news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nogovitsyn warned that targets will be destroyed interfax also reported that anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of russia 's general staff , had talked of poland in terms of a military strike .
" by putting up interceptors , poland is placing itself at risk .
in terms of priority , such targets are the first to be destroyed , " the interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
us and polish diplomats agreed on stationing 10 interceptors in poland in return for us military aid for the poles , including patriot air defense missiles .
nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .
accord increase risk of severe tensions the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said the us-polish deal would not boost security in europe and could lead to " to a real increase in tension in russian-american relations , " interfax reported late thursday .

lavrov mulls over his poland visit russian foreign minister sergei lavrov cancelled a planned september trip to poland hours after the deal was struck thursday , poland 's pap news agency said .
however , poland still expects the scheduled visit to take place , the foreign ministry said friday .
poland 's foreign ministry has no official word that lavrov has called off the visit , local media quoted a ministry spokesman as saying .
deputy foreign minister ryszard schnepf added that poland expects him and has many things to discuss with the moscow diplomat .
" i can only say that russia has n't called off the visit and we still count that it will come to pass , " schnepf told tvp info .
" lavrov will surely be eagerly greeted here and there are many subjects which we can and even should talk about with the russian federation , " he said .
offer to inspect site still stands , says poland poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski repeated on friday an offer to let russian inspectors inspect the planned us base that will form part of washington 's anti-missile system .
" our offer still stands , " he told polish state television station tvp3 .
" we want russia to be able to have the possibility , if it so desires , to inspect the future base " in poland .
the czech government welcomed the deal to base us missile interceptors in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm topolanek and condi rice made progress in july " we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement , which is also good for the czech republic and nato , " deputy foreign minister tomas pojar told the dpa news agency .
he questioned the comments from moscow which suggested the agreement was reached hastily in response to russia 's military assault on pro-western georgia .
" it would have happened even without the events in georgia , " pojar said , adding he was n't surprised that foreign minister sergei lavrov had reportedly cancelled his planned trip to poland .

" before the race my coach told me you need to swim your own race and that the others would start very fast , " she said .
" i decided to close my eyes and just go for it and i think it worked quite well . " after touching the pad in a time of 53.12 , she did not turn around to look at the results board , embracing trickett , who had swum in the lane next to hers instead . " at that moment i did not really know what had happened , " steffen said .
" i just wanted to enjoy the moment and i thought that even if i did not win a medal , i swam a wonderful race .
but then when i looked at the board i saw that i had won and everything was brilliant . " steffen said after her victory that credit must go to psychologist friederike janofske , with whom she has been working for a long time . " she has managed to bring out the best in me , " she said . the 24-year-old said that she thinks it also helped her that the german swim team had - so far - bombed out at the olympics . " there was very little pressure on me , " she said .
" my world record was gone , i had not done well in the relay and nobody really thought i was going to win a medal . bildunterschrift : steffen disappointed at the 2000 olympics , but friday showed that she has what it takes gold for three us swimmers superstar michael phelps set the benchmark for overall medals a little bit higher when he won his sixth gold medal of the competition and his 12th gold overall , to go three clear of four athletes with nine all-time olympic golds . phelps took his world record tally to six with his victory in the men 's 200-meter individual medley in a time of 1:54.23 seconds . american ryan lochte won the men 's 200-meter backstroke in a world record time of 1:53.94 - just 20 minutes before winning bronze in the 200 im - while fellow american rebecca soni took the women 's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:20.22 seconds , also in world record time . in the men 's 200-meter im , the medals went to the same swimmers who also stood on the podium in the same order for the 400-meter im , with phelps being followed by hungarian laszlo cseh and lochte . phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.80 that he established at the us trials last month . " i just wanted to step on it in the first 50-meter a little bit and try to get out to an early lead , " he said .
" i knew that it was a hard double for ryan -lrb- lochte -rrb- .
i knew that if i got a big enough lead in the first half i thought i could hang on and that 's all i wanted to do .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .
russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . on sunday , merkel will also visit tbilisi for talks with georgian president mikheil saakashvili . dw staff -lrb- sp / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2008 opinion : moscow should listen to merkel 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was openly critical of russian actions in the caucasus conflict during talks with president medvedev .
dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .

nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .

he questioned the comments from moscow which suggested the agreement was reached hastily in response to russia 's military assault on pro-western georgia .

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .
russia would continue discussions on the issue with " all actors , " the president said , while warning that the us move did not contribute to calm .
merkel insisted the shield was not directed at russia but was rather protection against countries like iran .
missile deal makes poland a target , says military chief this was not the view from the kremlin which reiterated its belief that the shield was aimed at moscow while a russian military spokesperson went further by saying that washington 's deal with warsaw made poland " 100 percent " a target for russia 's military .
" the agreement 's content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia , " the interfax news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nogovitsyn warned that targets will be destroyed interfax also reported that anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of russia 's general staff , had talked of poland in terms of a military strike .
" by putting up interceptors , poland is placing itself at risk .
in terms of priority , such targets are the first to be destroyed , " the interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
us and polish diplomats agreed on stationing 10 interceptors in poland in return for us military aid for the poles , including patriot air defense missiles .
nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .

both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .
russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .

fearing that the country could become what she calls a “ cheap-deal-hub ” for surrogacy , the women and child development minister renuka chaudhary has called for stronger laws against the practice .

the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .
i would say if it is a free contract between consenting adults it should not be a matter of breast beating . ’ ’
presently , there are no clear strictures regarding commercial surrogacy in india .
fearing that the country could become what she calls a “ cheap-deal-hub ” for surrogacy , the women and child development minister renuka chaudhary has called for stronger laws against the practice .
but dr kadam feels such fears are unfounded : “ i think we would be overreacting .
commercial surrogacy is very new and within a very short span of time it has gained a lot of importance . ”
the complicated case of manji yamada one case that has attracted huge media attention is that of manji yamada .
born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .
he and his wife divorced shortly before manji 's birth .
the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’

it 's the first time the group has gotten involved to help resolve a kidnapping . according to the german foreign ministry , two german workers kidnapped in nigeria over a month ago have now been released .
in a statement issued friday , aug .
15 , ministry spokesman andreas peschke said the two are receiving medical treatment and are doing well " considering the circumstances " and are in " good physical condition . " " the federal government is very relieved by their release , " he added .
employed by julius berger , a local affiliate of german construction company bilfinger berger , the two germans were kidnapped on july 11 at emohua in rivers state in the niger delta , an area notorious for kidnappings .
around 15 unidentified gunmen travelling in armored jeeps accompanied by 28 soldiers seized the workers of the country 's largest construction firm .
the violent kidnappings prompted julius berger to suspend all of its operations in the delta .
despite the safe release of its workers , the company is sticking to its decision to pull out of the area , a spokesperson for the company told dpa news agency .
act of kindness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mend is responsible for several attacks on oil companies operating in the area nigeria 's most prominent militant group , the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta -lrb- mend -rrb- rescued the hostages from the armed gang on thursday , reported reuters news service .
itself responsible for numerous attacks on oil companies that have consequently cut a fifth of nigeria 's oil output since early 2006 , mend released the germans near the oil hub port harcourt .
the group , which had announced about a week after the kidnappings that it had identified those responsible and would work to free the hostages , was reportedly motivated to intervene because the two germans were not employed in the energy sector , but rather were helping to build the delta 's infrastructure .
big player in nigeria the company julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta .
with more than 16,000 employees , it is one of the country 's biggest private sector employers .
according to reuters , mend 's rescue operation that concluded with the safe release of the german workers was the first time it had intervened in an act of kidnapping committed by another gang .
foreign companies weigh profits against inherent dangers an alarmingly dangerous area for foreigners , more than 200 people have been kidnapped in the niger delta since early 2006 .
such security problems have prompted numerous foreign firms to pull out of the area , reports afp .
almost all of the people seized in the niger delta to this point , however , have been freed unharmed . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" before the race my coach told me you need to swim your own race and that the others would start very fast , " she said .
" i decided to close my eyes and just go for it and i think it worked quite well . " after touching the pad in a time of 53.12 , she did not turn around to look at the results board , embracing trickett , who had swum in the lane next to hers instead . " at that moment i did not really know what had happened , " steffen said .
" i just wanted to enjoy the moment and i thought that even if i did not win a medal , i swam a wonderful race .
but then when i looked at the board i saw that i had won and everything was brilliant . " steffen said after her victory that credit must go to psychologist friederike janofske , with whom she has been working for a long time . " she has managed to bring out the best in me , " she said . the 24-year-old said that she thinks it also helped her that the german swim team had - so far - bombed out at the olympics . " there was very little pressure on me , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2008 opinion : moscow should listen to merkel 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was openly critical of russian actions in the caucasus conflict during talks with president medvedev .
dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .
russia would continue discussions on the issue with " all actors , " the president said , while warning that the us move did not contribute to calm .
merkel insisted the shield was not directed at russia but was rather protection against countries like iran .
missile deal makes poland a target , says military chief this was not the view from the kremlin which reiterated its belief that the shield was aimed at moscow while a russian military spokesperson went further by saying that washington 's deal with warsaw made poland " 100 percent " a target for russia 's military .
" the agreement 's content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia , " the interfax news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nogovitsyn warned that targets will be destroyed interfax also reported that anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of russia 's general staff , had talked of poland in terms of a military strike .
" by putting up interceptors , poland is placing itself at risk .
in terms of priority , such targets are the first to be destroyed , " the interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
us and polish diplomats agreed on stationing 10 interceptors in poland in return for us military aid for the poles , including patriot air defense missiles .
nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .
accord increase risk of severe tensions the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said the us-polish deal would not boost security in europe and could lead to " to a real increase in tension in russian-american relations , " interfax reported late thursday .

lavrov mulls over his poland visit russian foreign minister sergei lavrov cancelled a planned september trip to poland hours after the deal was struck thursday , poland 's pap news agency said .
however , poland still expects the scheduled visit to take place , the foreign ministry said friday .
poland 's foreign ministry has no official word that lavrov has called off the visit , local media quoted a ministry spokesman as saying .
deputy foreign minister ryszard schnepf added that poland expects him and has many things to discuss with the moscow diplomat .
" i can only say that russia has n't called off the visit and we still count that it will come to pass , " schnepf told tvp info .
" lavrov will surely be eagerly greeted here and there are many subjects which we can and even should talk about with the russian federation , " he said .
offer to inspect site still stands , says poland poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski repeated on friday an offer to let russian inspectors inspect the planned us base that will form part of washington 's anti-missile system .
" our offer still stands , " he told polish state television station tvp3 .
" we want russia to be able to have the possibility , if it so desires , to inspect the future base " in poland .
the czech government welcomed the deal to base us missile interceptors in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm topolanek and condi rice made progress in july " we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement , which is also good for the czech republic and nato , " deputy foreign minister tomas pojar told the dpa news agency .
he questioned the comments from moscow which suggested the agreement was reached hastily in response to russia 's military assault on pro-western georgia .
" it would have happened even without the events in georgia , " pojar said , adding he was n't surprised that foreign minister sergei lavrov had reportedly cancelled his planned trip to poland .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .
russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .
i would say if it is a free contract between consenting adults it should not be a matter of breast beating . ’ ’
presently , there are no clear strictures regarding commercial surrogacy in india .
fearing that the country could become what she calls a “ cheap-deal-hub ” for surrogacy , the women and child development minister renuka chaudhary has called for stronger laws against the practice .
but dr kadam feels such fears are unfounded : “ i think we would be overreacting .
commercial surrogacy is very new and within a very short span of time it has gained a lot of importance . ”
the complicated case of manji yamada one case that has attracted huge media attention is that of manji yamada .
born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .
he and his wife divorced shortly before manji 's birth .
the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’
but even if manji can not yet leave indian shores , the supreme court has allowed her to be under the care of her grandmother emiko yamada , who has travelled to india .

the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .
i would say if it is a free contract between consenting adults it should not be a matter of breast beating . ’ ’
presently , there are no clear strictures regarding commercial surrogacy in india .
fearing that the country could become what she calls a “ cheap-deal-hub ” for surrogacy , the women and child development minister renuka chaudhary has called for stronger laws against the practice .
but dr kadam feels such fears are unfounded : “ i think we would be overreacting .
commercial surrogacy is very new and within a very short span of time it has gained a lot of importance . ”
the complicated case of manji yamada one case that has attracted huge media attention is that of manji yamada .
born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .
he and his wife divorced shortly before manji 's birth .
the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’
but even if manji can not yet leave indian shores , the supreme court has allowed her to be under the care of her grandmother emiko yamada , who has travelled to india .
although there are no clear statistics about the exact number of surrogate mothers and babies born per year , experts estimate there could be hundreds in india .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2008 opinion : moscow should listen to merkel 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was openly critical of russian actions in the caucasus conflict during talks with president medvedev .
dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .
russia would continue discussions on the issue with " all actors , " the president said , while warning that the us move did not contribute to calm .
merkel insisted the shield was not directed at russia but was rather protection against countries like iran .
missile deal makes poland a target , says military chief this was not the view from the kremlin which reiterated its belief that the shield was aimed at moscow while a russian military spokesperson went further by saying that washington 's deal with warsaw made poland " 100 percent " a target for russia 's military .
" the agreement 's content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia , " the interfax news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nogovitsyn warned that targets will be destroyed interfax also reported that anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of russia 's general staff , had talked of poland in terms of a military strike .
" by putting up interceptors , poland is placing itself at risk .
in terms of priority , such targets are the first to be destroyed , " the interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
us and polish diplomats agreed on stationing 10 interceptors in poland in return for us military aid for the poles , including patriot air defense missiles .
nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .
accord increase risk of severe tensions the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said the us-polish deal would not boost security in europe and could lead to " to a real increase in tension in russian-american relations , " interfax reported late thursday .

lavrov mulls over his poland visit russian foreign minister sergei lavrov cancelled a planned september trip to poland hours after the deal was struck thursday , poland 's pap news agency said .
however , poland still expects the scheduled visit to take place , the foreign ministry said friday .
poland 's foreign ministry has no official word that lavrov has called off the visit , local media quoted a ministry spokesman as saying .
deputy foreign minister ryszard schnepf added that poland expects him and has many things to discuss with the moscow diplomat .
" i can only say that russia has n't called off the visit and we still count that it will come to pass , " schnepf told tvp info .
" lavrov will surely be eagerly greeted here and there are many subjects which we can and even should talk about with the russian federation , " he said .
offer to inspect site still stands , says poland poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski repeated on friday an offer to let russian inspectors inspect the planned us base that will form part of washington 's anti-missile system .
" our offer still stands , " he told polish state television station tvp3 .
" we want russia to be able to have the possibility , if it so desires , to inspect the future base " in poland .
the czech government welcomed the deal to base us missile interceptors in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm topolanek and condi rice made progress in july " we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement , which is also good for the czech republic and nato , " deputy foreign minister tomas pojar told the dpa news agency .
he questioned the comments from moscow which suggested the agreement was reached hastily in response to russia 's military assault on pro-western georgia .
" it would have happened even without the events in georgia , " pojar said , adding he was n't surprised that foreign minister sergei lavrov had reportedly cancelled his planned trip to poland .

" before the race my coach told me you need to swim your own race and that the others would start very fast , " she said .
" i decided to close my eyes and just go for it and i think it worked quite well . " after touching the pad in a time of 53.12 , she did not turn around to look at the results board , embracing trickett , who had swum in the lane next to hers instead . " at that moment i did not really know what had happened , " steffen said .
" i just wanted to enjoy the moment and i thought that even if i did not win a medal , i swam a wonderful race .
but then when i looked at the board i saw that i had won and everything was brilliant . " steffen said after her victory that credit must go to psychologist friederike janofske , with whom she has been working for a long time . " she has managed to bring out the best in me , " she said . the 24-year-old said that she thinks it also helped her that the german swim team had - so far - bombed out at the olympics . " there was very little pressure on me , " she said .
" my world record was gone , i had not done well in the relay and nobody really thought i was going to win a medal . bildunterschrift : steffen disappointed at the 2000 olympics , but friday showed that she has what it takes gold for three us swimmers superstar michael phelps set the benchmark for overall medals a little bit higher when he won his sixth gold medal of the competition and his 12th gold overall , to go three clear of four athletes with nine all-time olympic golds . phelps took his world record tally to six with his victory in the men 's 200-meter individual medley in a time of 1:54.23 seconds . american ryan lochte won the men 's 200-meter backstroke in a world record time of 1:53.94 - just 20 minutes before winning bronze in the 200 im - while fellow american rebecca soni took the women 's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:20.22 seconds , also in world record time . in the men 's 200-meter im , the medals went to the same swimmers who also stood on the podium in the same order for the 400-meter im , with phelps being followed by hungarian laszlo cseh and lochte . phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.80 that he established at the us trials last month . " i just wanted to step on it in the first 50-meter a little bit and try to get out to an early lead , " he said .
" i knew that it was a hard double for ryan -lrb- lochte -rrb- .

it 's the first time the group has gotten involved to help resolve a kidnapping . according to the german foreign ministry , two german workers kidnapped in nigeria over a month ago have now been released .
in a statement issued friday , aug .
15 , ministry spokesman andreas peschke said the two are receiving medical treatment and are doing well " considering the circumstances " and are in " good physical condition . " " the federal government is very relieved by their release , " he added .
employed by julius berger , a local affiliate of german construction company bilfinger berger , the two germans were kidnapped on july 11 at emohua in rivers state in the niger delta , an area notorious for kidnappings .
around 15 unidentified gunmen travelling in armored jeeps accompanied by 28 soldiers seized the workers of the country 's largest construction firm .
the violent kidnappings prompted julius berger to suspend all of its operations in the delta .
despite the safe release of its workers , the company is sticking to its decision to pull out of the area , a spokesperson for the company told dpa news agency .
act of kindness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mend is responsible for several attacks on oil companies operating in the area nigeria 's most prominent militant group , the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta -lrb- mend -rrb- rescued the hostages from the armed gang on thursday , reported reuters news service .
itself responsible for numerous attacks on oil companies that have consequently cut a fifth of nigeria 's oil output since early 2006 , mend released the germans near the oil hub port harcourt .
the group , which had announced about a week after the kidnappings that it had identified those responsible and would work to free the hostages , was reportedly motivated to intervene because the two germans were not employed in the energy sector , but rather were helping to build the delta 's infrastructure .
big player in nigeria the company julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta .
with more than 16,000 employees , it is one of the country 's biggest private sector employers .
according to reuters , mend 's rescue operation that concluded with the safe release of the german workers was the first time it had intervened in an act of kidnapping committed by another gang .
foreign companies weigh profits against inherent dangers an alarmingly dangerous area for foreigners , more than 200 people have been kidnapped in the niger delta since early 2006 .
such security problems have prompted numerous foreign firms to pull out of the area , reports afp .
almost all of the people seized in the niger delta to this point , however , have been freed unharmed . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both nations are split by staunch political beliefs . war in georgia has divided the people of latvia and estonia , two ex-soviet nations where russian speakers are the largest ethnic minority .
rival loyalties , never far below the surface , surged into the open as baltic leaders sided with georgia 's us-backed president , mikheil saakashvili , based on a shared history of oppression by moscow .
" saakhashvili is an inappropriate president , " said valentina smorodina , 75 , an ethnic russian who came to latvia after world war ii from russia .
" they ought to put him on trial and shoot him . "
" the latvian government should be ashamed for supporting him , " she told dpa news agency at her home in bolderaja , a mostly russian neighborhood in the latvian capital , riga , where a former soviet naval barracks sits empty .
here , she resides in a parallel universe that has little to do with latvia .
like many others , she watches kremlin-sponsored television news and reads local russian newspapers , which support russia 's military assault in georgia .
passionage supporters and protestors as russia and georgia engage in propaganda wars in the international media , russians and latvians are split over the conflict 2,200 kilometers -lrb- 1,367 miles -rrb- away .
demonstrators in all three baltic nations - estonia , latvia and lithuania - have held pro-georgia rallies since the conflict erupted last week .
mostly ethnic estonians , latvians , and lithuanians protested outside russian embassies in their capitals , calling on russia to cease what they called " aggression " against a neighbor .
latvia 's russian minority , which accounts for about a third of its 2.3 million people , staged its own rally in support of moscow 's actions in georgia .
holding signs " russia , you 're right " and " russia is a bulwark of peace , " several hundred mostly ethnic russians gathered this week outside the russian embassy in the latvian capital , riga , two days after several thousands had come out to offer support to georgia and condemn russia .
a history of war as baltic governments offer political and humanitarian assistance to georgia , ethnic russians ask for blood and clothing donations for victims in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia .
history helps explain why baltic leaders offered to help georgia .
soviet tanks crushed 22 years of baltic independence in 1940 , deporting estonians , latvians and lithuanians to siberian gulags .
after a three-year german occupation during world war ii , the soviets regained control of the baltics until communism crumbled in 1990 .
so a resurgent russia flexing its military muscle near its border in georgia gives balts a sense of deja-vu .
" my father jokingly asked , ' to which country would you be moving if the russians come ? ' said latvian woman ilze murniece , 32 .
as another sign of a divide , the harmony center , one out of two parties representing ethnic russians in the latvian parliament , boycotted a debate on the situation in georgia on thursday .
another party , for humans rights in united latvia , had sharp words ahead of the vote to condemn russia 's behavior in georgia .
" i hope that you 'll remember the advice of former french president jacques chirac that there are moments when it 's better for latvia to keep silent , " said jakovs pliners , referring to chirac 's reaction to the new eu members , including latvia , support for the us invasion in iraq in 2003 .
" the way russia throws its weight around clearly should make everyone a little upset , " estonian president toomas hendrik ilves told dpa in a phone interview from tallinn .
in response , tech-savvy estonia sent experts to help divert cyber attacks on georgian servers , after estonian servers were attacked in a dispute with russia in 2007 .
latvia 's government set aside 100,000 lats -lrb- 143,500 euros , $ 212,000 -rrb- in aid to georgia .
leaders of the three baltic states , poland and ukraine traveled to georgia this week to show support .
condemning russia the baltics present themselves as examples of transformation from former soviet republics into members of the european union and nato , which the three countries joined in 2004 .
they have been sharing their experience with georgia and supported its bid to join nato .
not all latvians support georgia , but they do widely condemn russia 's actions .
" yes , i blame both sides , " said latvian university student ainars leijejs , who organized small protests at the georgian and russian embassies .
" but there is no doubt that russia today is the first and biggest aggressor and enemy of a world in peace . " dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .
it remains highly disputed whether former members of terrorist organizations can be forced to testify against fellow members after having served their sentence . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2008 opinion : moscow should listen to merkel 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was openly critical of russian actions in the caucasus conflict during talks with president medvedev .
dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia .

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .

" i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .
russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .
russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .

15 , but the change of coach from the experienced ottmar hitzfeld to 44-year-old klinsmann could provide an opportunity for the bavarians ' leading rivals . bayern won last year 's title at a trot , enjoying a 10-point gap over second-placed werder bremen , and klinsmann can rely on basically the same set of players with the exception of veteran goalkeeper oliver kahn , who has retired , has been replaced by the young michael rensing . unlike last season 's 70 million euro -lrb- $ 104 million -rrb- shopping spree , munich have foregone the transfer market for the 2008-09 season .
midfielder tim borowski , arriving on a free transfer from bremen , is the only newcomer of note .
instead the club has splurged on former international striker klinsmann and his coaching staff . stars on the bayern bench klinsmann , who took germany to third place in the 2006 world cup , wants a swifter , more attacking game from bayern , but it may take time for his methods to bear fruit and could open up opportunities for the likes of bremen and schalke . bayern 's pre-season form has been patchy , with training marked by injuries and the late arrival of their euro 2008 internationals . bayern 's opener against hamburg on friday will also be marked by prominent holes in the star-studded lineup .. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern stars ribery and toni wo n't be playing against hamburg striker luca toni , midfielder franck ribery , defenders willy sagnol , martin demichelis and midfielder hamit altintop have all been ruled out against hamburg while argentina midfielder jose ernesto sosa and brazilian defender breno are away competing for their national teams at the olympics . bayern struggled to overcome third division rot-weiss erfurt in the german cup on sunday , but klinsmann said he was confident of an improvement before his team takes the field against hamburg . " we have worked on the mistakes against erfurt , " he said .
" we have done a lot in the tactical area and what 's only lacking now is the fine-tuning . " hamburg , who finished fourth last season , also start with a new coach , 52-year-old dutchman martin jol , who played nine games for bayern in the 1978-79 season . jol has to compensate for the loss of dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart to real madrid , but the northern side have looked solid in pre-season matches and put up a decent show at the recently concluded emirates cup in london against real madrid and juventus . " bayern have had a few problems with their preparations and we have some good results despite one two small difficulties , " jol said .
" we know they 've got some player problems .
ribery is out , and toni , demichelis and sagnol are also injured , but we 've also seen that they 've got other good players . " bremen confident , schalke hopes to end drought meanwhile bremen 's brazilian defender naldo believes the club is better placed than last season to challenge for the title . " the team is top fit , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" unlike last season we have no injury complaints apart from per mertesacker . " germany defender mertesacker , who suffered a cartilage injury in training that required surgery , will be sidelined for several weeks .
bremen are also missing brazil midfielder diego , who is at the olympics , for their game saturday against arminia bielefeld . schalke , who placed third last season , begin the season on saturday at home against hanover under new dutch coach fred rutten .
the side will be hoping to end their 50-year title drought - the last time they lifted a league trophy was in the pre-bundesliga era . gelsenkirchen too may be without peru striker jefferson farfan , a major new signing along with dutch midfielder orlando engelaar , who suffered a shoulder injury in the 1-0 victory wednesday against atletico madrid in a champions league qualifying match . all eyes on hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim and its famous millionare club owner , sap 's dietmar hopp have created a stir with their promotion wolfsburg , who finished fifth last term , take on newly-promoted cologne at home , having spent more than 25 million euros on new players . bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund duel under new coaches , with bruno labbadia now in charge at leverkusen and juergen klopp on the bench at dortmund . in other matches saturday , promoted hoffenheim are at energie cottbus , and karlsruhe take on bochum . sunday 's matches see eintracht frankfurt battle hertha berlin while promoted borussia moenchenglach meet vfb stuttgart . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2008 opinion : moscow should listen to merkel 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was openly critical of russian actions in the caucasus conflict during talks with president medvedev .
dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three former raf terrorists convicted in the 1977 murder of attorney general siegfried buback wo n't have to serve an additional sentence for refusing to give further testimony in the case , ruled germany 's highest court . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe decided friday , aug .
15 , that former red army faction terrorists christian klar , brigitte mohnhaupt and knut folkerts would not receive an added prison sentence of up to six months , thus overturning a ruling by the investigating judge . all three members of the left-wing terrorist group , which was active in germany in the 1970s and 1980s , were convicted for taking part in the murder of buback and his two companions . had the additional sentence been upheld , klar 's time in prison would have been extended .
mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .
it remains highly disputed whether former members of terrorist organizations can be forced to testify against fellow members after having served their sentence . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 15.08.2008 kidnapped germans freed in nigeria by mend militant group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta is a dangerous zone for foreign workers two german employees of a nigerian construction company have been rescued and released by militant group mend .
it 's the first time the group has gotten involved to help resolve a kidnapping . according to the german foreign ministry , two german workers kidnapped in nigeria over a month ago have now been released .
in a statement issued friday , aug .
15 , ministry spokesman andreas peschke said the two are receiving medical treatment and are doing well " considering the circumstances " and are in " good physical condition . " " the federal government is very relieved by their release , " he added .
employed by julius berger , a local affiliate of german construction company bilfinger berger , the two germans were kidnapped on july 11 at emohua in rivers state in the niger delta , an area notorious for kidnappings .
around 15 unidentified gunmen travelling in armored jeeps accompanied by 28 soldiers seized the workers of the country 's largest construction firm .
the violent kidnappings prompted julius berger to suspend all of its operations in the delta .
despite the safe release of its workers , the company is sticking to its decision to pull out of the area , a spokesperson for the company told dpa news agency .
act of kindness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mend is responsible for several attacks on oil companies operating in the area nigeria 's most prominent militant group , the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta -lrb- mend -rrb- rescued the hostages from the armed gang on thursday , reported reuters news service .
itself responsible for numerous attacks on oil companies that have consequently cut a fifth of nigeria 's oil output since early 2006 , mend released the germans near the oil hub port harcourt .
the group , which had announced about a week after the kidnappings that it had identified those responsible and would work to free the hostages , was reportedly motivated to intervene because the two germans were not employed in the energy sector , but rather were helping to build the delta 's infrastructure .
big player in nigeria the company julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta .
with more than 16,000 employees , it is one of the country 's biggest private sector employers .
according to reuters , mend 's rescue operation that concluded with the safe release of the german workers was the first time it had intervened in an act of kidnapping committed by another gang .
foreign companies weigh profits against inherent dangers an alarmingly dangerous area for foreigners , more than 200 people have been kidnapped in the niger delta since early 2006 .

" i decided to close my eyes and just go for it and i think it worked quite well . " after touching the pad in a time of 53.12 , she did not turn around to look at the results board , embracing trickett , who had swum in the lane next to hers instead . " at that moment i did not really know what had happened , " steffen said .
" i just wanted to enjoy the moment and i thought that even if i did not win a medal , i swam a wonderful race .
but then when i looked at the board i saw that i had won and everything was brilliant . " steffen said after her victory that credit must go to psychologist friederike janofske , with whom she has been working for a long time . " she has managed to bring out the best in me , " she said . the 24-year-old said that she thinks it also helped her that the german swim team had - so far - bombed out at the olympics . " there was very little pressure on me , " she said .
" my world record was gone , i had not done well in the relay and nobody really thought i was going to win a medal . bildunterschrift : steffen disappointed at the 2000 olympics , but friday showed that she has what it takes gold for three us swimmers superstar michael phelps set the benchmark for overall medals a little bit higher when he won his sixth gold medal of the competition and his 12th gold overall , to go three clear of four athletes with nine all-time olympic golds . phelps took his world record tally to six with his victory in the men 's 200-meter individual medley in a time of 1:54.23 seconds . american ryan lochte won the men 's 200-meter backstroke in a world record time of 1:53.94 - just 20 minutes before winning bronze in the 200 im - while fellow american rebecca soni took the women 's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:20.22 seconds , also in world record time . in the men 's 200-meter im , the medals went to the same swimmers who also stood on the podium in the same order for the 400-meter im , with phelps being followed by hungarian laszlo cseh and lochte . phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.80 that he established at the us trials last month . " i just wanted to step on it in the first 50-meter a little bit and try to get out to an early lead , " he said .
" i knew that it was a hard double for ryan -lrb- lochte -rrb- .

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .
russia would continue discussions on the issue with " all actors , " the president said , while warning that the us move did not contribute to calm .
merkel insisted the shield was not directed at russia but was rather protection against countries like iran .
missile deal makes poland a target , says military chief this was not the view from the kremlin which reiterated its belief that the shield was aimed at moscow while a russian military spokesperson went further by saying that washington 's deal with warsaw made poland " 100 percent " a target for russia 's military .
" the agreement 's content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia , " the interfax news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nogovitsyn warned that targets will be destroyed interfax also reported that anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of russia 's general staff , had talked of poland in terms of a military strike .
" by putting up interceptors , poland is placing itself at risk .
in terms of priority , such targets are the first to be destroyed , " the interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
us and polish diplomats agreed on stationing 10 interceptors in poland in return for us military aid for the poles , including patriot air defense missiles .
nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .
accord increase risk of severe tensions the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said the us-polish deal would not boost security in europe and could lead to " to a real increase in tension in russian-american relations , " interfax reported late thursday .

lavrov mulls over his poland visit russian foreign minister sergei lavrov cancelled a planned september trip to poland hours after the deal was struck thursday , poland 's pap news agency said .
however , poland still expects the scheduled visit to take place , the foreign ministry said friday .
poland 's foreign ministry has no official word that lavrov has called off the visit , local media quoted a ministry spokesman as saying .
deputy foreign minister ryszard schnepf added that poland expects him and has many things to discuss with the moscow diplomat .
" i can only say that russia has n't called off the visit and we still count that it will come to pass , " schnepf told tvp info .
" lavrov will surely be eagerly greeted here and there are many subjects which we can and even should talk about with the russian federation , " he said .
offer to inspect site still stands , says poland poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski repeated on friday an offer to let russian inspectors inspect the planned us base that will form part of washington 's anti-missile system .
" our offer still stands , " he told polish state television station tvp3 .
" we want russia to be able to have the possibility , if it so desires , to inspect the future base " in poland .
the czech government welcomed the deal to base us missile interceptors in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm topolanek and condi rice made progress in july " we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement , which is also good for the czech republic and nato , " deputy foreign minister tomas pojar told the dpa news agency .
he questioned the comments from moscow which suggested the agreement was reached hastily in response to russia 's military assault on pro-western georgia .
" it would have happened even without the events in georgia , " pojar said , adding he was n't surprised that foreign minister sergei lavrov had reportedly cancelled his planned trip to poland .

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .
russia would continue discussions on the issue with " all actors , " the president said , while warning that the us move did not contribute to calm .
merkel insisted the shield was not directed at russia but was rather protection against countries like iran .
missile deal makes poland a target , says military chief this was not the view from the kremlin which reiterated its belief that the shield was aimed at moscow while a russian military spokesperson went further by saying that washington 's deal with warsaw made poland " 100 percent " a target for russia 's military .
" the agreement 's content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia , " the interfax news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nogovitsyn warned that targets will be destroyed interfax also reported that anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of russia 's general staff , had talked of poland in terms of a military strike .
" by putting up interceptors , poland is placing itself at risk .
in terms of priority , such targets are the first to be destroyed , " the interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
us and polish diplomats agreed on stationing 10 interceptors in poland in return for us military aid for the poles , including patriot air defense missiles .
nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .
accord increase risk of severe tensions the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said the us-polish deal would not boost security in europe and could lead to " to a real increase in tension in russian-american relations , " interfax reported late thursday .

lavrov mulls over his poland visit russian foreign minister sergei lavrov cancelled a planned september trip to poland hours after the deal was struck thursday , poland 's pap news agency said .
however , poland still expects the scheduled visit to take place , the foreign ministry said friday .
poland 's foreign ministry has no official word that lavrov has called off the visit , local media quoted a ministry spokesman as saying .
deputy foreign minister ryszard schnepf added that poland expects him and has many things to discuss with the moscow diplomat .
" i can only say that russia has n't called off the visit and we still count that it will come to pass , " schnepf told tvp info .
" lavrov will surely be eagerly greeted here and there are many subjects which we can and even should talk about with the russian federation , " he said .
offer to inspect site still stands , says poland poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski repeated on friday an offer to let russian inspectors inspect the planned us base that will form part of washington 's anti-missile system .
" our offer still stands , " he told polish state television station tvp3 .
" we want russia to be able to have the possibility , if it so desires , to inspect the future base " in poland .
the czech government welcomed the deal to base us missile interceptors in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm topolanek and condi rice made progress in july " we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement , which is also good for the czech republic and nato , " deputy foreign minister tomas pojar told the dpa news agency .
he questioned the comments from moscow which suggested the agreement was reached hastily in response to russia 's military assault on pro-western georgia .
" it would have happened even without the events in georgia , " pojar said , adding he was n't surprised that foreign minister sergei lavrov had reportedly cancelled his planned trip to poland .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .

" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .

" it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . on sunday , merkel will also visit tbilisi for talks with georgian president mikheil saakashvili . dw staff -lrb- sp / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .
i would say if it is a free contract between consenting adults it should not be a matter of breast beating . ’ ’
presently , there are no clear strictures regarding commercial surrogacy in india .
fearing that the country could become what she calls a “ cheap-deal-hub ” for surrogacy , the women and child development minister renuka chaudhary has called for stronger laws against the practice .
but dr kadam feels such fears are unfounded : “ i think we would be overreacting .
commercial surrogacy is very new and within a very short span of time it has gained a lot of importance . ”
the complicated case of manji yamada one case that has attracted huge media attention is that of manji yamada .
born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .
he and his wife divorced shortly before manji 's birth .
the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’
but even if manji can not yet leave indian shores , the supreme court has allowed her to be under the care of her grandmother emiko yamada , who has travelled to india .

the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .

born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .

the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’

it 's the first time the group has gotten involved to help resolve a kidnapping . according to the german foreign ministry , two german workers kidnapped in nigeria over a month ago have now been released .
in a statement issued friday , aug .
15 , ministry spokesman andreas peschke said the two are receiving medical treatment and are doing well " considering the circumstances " and are in " good physical condition . " " the federal government is very relieved by their release , " he added .
employed by julius berger , a local affiliate of german construction company bilfinger berger , the two germans were kidnapped on july 11 at emohua in rivers state in the niger delta , an area notorious for kidnappings .
around 15 unidentified gunmen travelling in armored jeeps accompanied by 28 soldiers seized the workers of the country 's largest construction firm .
the violent kidnappings prompted julius berger to suspend all of its operations in the delta .
despite the safe release of its workers , the company is sticking to its decision to pull out of the area , a spokesperson for the company told dpa news agency .

itself responsible for numerous attacks on oil companies that have consequently cut a fifth of nigeria 's oil output since early 2006 , mend released the germans near the oil hub port harcourt .
the group , which had announced about a week after the kidnappings that it had identified those responsible and would work to free the hostages , was reportedly motivated to intervene because the two germans were not employed in the energy sector , but rather were helping to build the delta 's infrastructure .
big player in nigeria the company julius berger is currently rebuilding the main east-west road across the niger delta .
with more than 16,000 employees , it is one of the country 's biggest private sector employers .
according to reuters , mend 's rescue operation that concluded with the safe release of the german workers was the first time it had intervened in an act of kidnapping committed by another gang .
foreign companies weigh profits against inherent dangers an alarmingly dangerous area for foreigners , more than 200 people have been kidnapped in the niger delta since early 2006 .
such security problems have prompted numerous foreign firms to pull out of the area , reports afp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2008 opinion : moscow should listen to merkel 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was openly critical of russian actions in the caucasus conflict during talks with president medvedev .
dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i decided to close my eyes and just go for it and i think it worked quite well .

" before the race my coach told me you need to swim your own race and that the others would start very fast , " she said .
" i decided to close my eyes and just go for it and i think it worked quite well . " after touching the pad in a time of 53.12 , she did not turn around to look at the results board , embracing trickett , who had swum in the lane next to hers instead . " at that moment i did not really know what had happened , " steffen said .
" i just wanted to enjoy the moment and i thought that even if i did not win a medal , i swam a wonderful race .
but then when i looked at the board i saw that i had won and everything was brilliant . " steffen said after her victory that credit must go to psychologist friederike janofske , with whom she has been working for a long time . " she has managed to bring out the best in me , " she said . the 24-year-old said that she thinks it also helped her that the german swim team had - so far - bombed out at the olympics . " there was very little pressure on me , " she said .
" my world record was gone , i had not done well in the relay and nobody really thought i was going to win a medal . bildunterschrift : steffen disappointed at the 2000 olympics , but friday showed that she has what it takes gold for three us swimmers superstar michael phelps set the benchmark for overall medals a little bit higher when he won his sixth gold medal of the competition and his 12th gold overall , to go three clear of four athletes with nine all-time olympic golds . phelps took his world record tally to six with his victory in the men 's 200-meter individual medley in a time of 1:54.23 seconds . american ryan lochte won the men 's 200-meter backstroke in a world record time of 1:53.94 - just 20 minutes before winning bronze in the 200 im - while fellow american rebecca soni took the women 's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:20.22 seconds , also in world record time . in the men 's 200-meter im , the medals went to the same swimmers who also stood on the podium in the same order for the 400-meter im , with phelps being followed by hungarian laszlo cseh and lochte . phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.80 that he established at the us trials last month . " i just wanted to step on it in the first 50-meter a little bit and try to get out to an early lead , " he said .
" i knew that it was a hard double for ryan -lrb- lochte -rrb- .
i knew that if i got a big enough lead in the first half i thought i could hang on and that 's all i wanted to do .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . on sunday , merkel will also visit tbilisi for talks with georgian president mikheil saakashvili . dw staff -lrb- sp / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "

medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .

both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .

three former raf terrorists convicted in the 1977 murder of attorney general siegfried buback wo n't have to serve an additional sentence for refusing to give further testimony in the case , ruled germany 's highest court . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe decided friday , aug .
15 , that former red army faction terrorists christian klar , brigitte mohnhaupt and knut folkerts would not receive an added prison sentence of up to six months , thus overturning a ruling by the investigating judge . all three members of the left-wing terrorist group , which was active in germany in the 1970s and 1980s , were convicted for taking part in the murder of buback and his two companions . had the additional sentence been upheld , klar 's time in prison would have been extended .
mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .
it remains highly disputed whether former members of terrorist organizations can be forced to testify against fellow members after having served their sentence . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . on sunday , merkel will also visit tbilisi for talks with georgian president mikheil saakashvili . dw staff -lrb- sp / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . on sunday , merkel will also visit tbilisi for talks with georgian president mikheil saakashvili . dw staff -lrb- sp / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both nations are split by staunch political beliefs . war in georgia has divided the people of latvia and estonia , two ex-soviet nations where russian speakers are the largest ethnic minority .
rival loyalties , never far below the surface , surged into the open as baltic leaders sided with georgia 's us-backed president , mikheil saakashvili , based on a shared history of oppression by moscow .
" saakhashvili is an inappropriate president , " said valentina smorodina , 75 , an ethnic russian who came to latvia after world war ii from russia .
" they ought to put him on trial and shoot him . "
" the latvian government should be ashamed for supporting him , " she told dpa news agency at her home in bolderaja , a mostly russian neighborhood in the latvian capital , riga , where a former soviet naval barracks sits empty .
here , she resides in a parallel universe that has little to do with latvia .
like many others , she watches kremlin-sponsored television news and reads local russian newspapers , which support russia 's military assault in georgia .
passionage supporters and protestors as russia and georgia engage in propaganda wars in the international media , russians and latvians are split over the conflict 2,200 kilometers -lrb- 1,367 miles -rrb- away .
demonstrators in all three baltic nations - estonia , latvia and lithuania - have held pro-georgia rallies since the conflict erupted last week .
mostly ethnic estonians , latvians , and lithuanians protested outside russian embassies in their capitals , calling on russia to cease what they called " aggression " against a neighbor .
latvia 's russian minority , which accounts for about a third of its 2.3 million people , staged its own rally in support of moscow 's actions in georgia .
holding signs " russia , you 're right " and " russia is a bulwark of peace , " several hundred mostly ethnic russians gathered this week outside the russian embassy in the latvian capital , riga , two days after several thousands had come out to offer support to georgia and condemn russia .
a history of war as baltic governments offer political and humanitarian assistance to georgia , ethnic russians ask for blood and clothing donations for victims in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia .
history helps explain why baltic leaders offered to help georgia .
soviet tanks crushed 22 years of baltic independence in 1940 , deporting estonians , latvians and lithuanians to siberian gulags .
after a three-year german occupation during world war ii , the soviets regained control of the baltics until communism crumbled in 1990 .
so a resurgent russia flexing its military muscle near its border in georgia gives balts a sense of deja-vu .
" my father jokingly asked , ' to which country would you be moving if the russians come ? ' said latvian woman ilze murniece , 32 .
as another sign of a divide , the harmony center , one out of two parties representing ethnic russians in the latvian parliament , boycotted a debate on the situation in georgia on thursday .
another party , for humans rights in united latvia , had sharp words ahead of the vote to condemn russia 's behavior in georgia .
" i hope that you 'll remember the advice of former french president jacques chirac that there are moments when it 's better for latvia to keep silent , " said jakovs pliners , referring to chirac 's reaction to the new eu members , including latvia , support for the us invasion in iraq in 2003 .
" the way russia throws its weight around clearly should make everyone a little upset , " estonian president toomas hendrik ilves told dpa in a phone interview from tallinn .
in response , tech-savvy estonia sent experts to help divert cyber attacks on georgian servers , after estonian servers were attacked in a dispute with russia in 2007 .
latvia 's government set aside 100,000 lats -lrb- 143,500 euros , $ 212,000 -rrb- in aid to georgia .
leaders of the three baltic states , poland and ukraine traveled to georgia this week to show support .
condemning russia the baltics present themselves as examples of transformation from former soviet republics into members of the european union and nato , which the three countries joined in 2004 .
they have been sharing their experience with georgia and supported its bid to join nato .
not all latvians support georgia , but they do widely condemn russia 's actions .
" yes , i blame both sides , " said latvian university student ainars leijejs , who organized small protests at the georgian and russian embassies .
" but there is no doubt that russia today is the first and biggest aggressor and enemy of a world in peace . " dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both nations are split by staunch political beliefs . war in georgia has divided the people of latvia and estonia , two ex-soviet nations where russian speakers are the largest ethnic minority .
rival loyalties , never far below the surface , surged into the open as baltic leaders sided with georgia 's us-backed president , mikheil saakashvili , based on a shared history of oppression by moscow .
" saakhashvili is an inappropriate president , " said valentina smorodina , 75 , an ethnic russian who came to latvia after world war ii from russia .
" they ought to put him on trial and shoot him . "
" the latvian government should be ashamed for supporting him , " she told dpa news agency at her home in bolderaja , a mostly russian neighborhood in the latvian capital , riga , where a former soviet naval barracks sits empty .
here , she resides in a parallel universe that has little to do with latvia .
like many others , she watches kremlin-sponsored television news and reads local russian newspapers , which support russia 's military assault in georgia .
passionage supporters and protestors as russia and georgia engage in propaganda wars in the international media , russians and latvians are split over the conflict 2,200 kilometers -lrb- 1,367 miles -rrb- away .
demonstrators in all three baltic nations - estonia , latvia and lithuania - have held pro-georgia rallies since the conflict erupted last week .
mostly ethnic estonians , latvians , and lithuanians protested outside russian embassies in their capitals , calling on russia to cease what they called " aggression " against a neighbor .
latvia 's russian minority , which accounts for about a third of its 2.3 million people , staged its own rally in support of moscow 's actions in georgia .
holding signs " russia , you 're right " and " russia is a bulwark of peace , " several hundred mostly ethnic russians gathered this week outside the russian embassy in the latvian capital , riga , two days after several thousands had come out to offer support to georgia and condemn russia .
a history of war as baltic governments offer political and humanitarian assistance to georgia , ethnic russians ask for blood and clothing donations for victims in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia .
history helps explain why baltic leaders offered to help georgia .
soviet tanks crushed 22 years of baltic independence in 1940 , deporting estonians , latvians and lithuanians to siberian gulags .
after a three-year german occupation during world war ii , the soviets regained control of the baltics until communism crumbled in 1990 .
so a resurgent russia flexing its military muscle near its border in georgia gives balts a sense of deja-vu .
" my father jokingly asked , ' to which country would you be moving if the russians come ? ' said latvian woman ilze murniece , 32 .
as another sign of a divide , the harmony center , one out of two parties representing ethnic russians in the latvian parliament , boycotted a debate on the situation in georgia on thursday .
another party , for humans rights in united latvia , had sharp words ahead of the vote to condemn russia 's behavior in georgia .
" i hope that you 'll remember the advice of former french president jacques chirac that there are moments when it 's better for latvia to keep silent , " said jakovs pliners , referring to chirac 's reaction to the new eu members , including latvia , support for the us invasion in iraq in 2003 .
" the way russia throws its weight around clearly should make everyone a little upset , " estonian president toomas hendrik ilves told dpa in a phone interview from tallinn .
in response , tech-savvy estonia sent experts to help divert cyber attacks on georgian servers , after estonian servers were attacked in a dispute with russia in 2007 .
latvia 's government set aside 100,000 lats -lrb- 143,500 euros , $ 212,000 -rrb- in aid to georgia .
leaders of the three baltic states , poland and ukraine traveled to georgia this week to show support .
condemning russia the baltics present themselves as examples of transformation from former soviet republics into members of the european union and nato , which the three countries joined in 2004 .
they have been sharing their experience with georgia and supported its bid to join nato .
not all latvians support georgia , but they do widely condemn russia 's actions .
" yes , i blame both sides , " said latvian university student ainars leijejs , who organized small protests at the georgian and russian embassies .
" but there is no doubt that russia today is the first and biggest aggressor and enemy of a world in peace . " dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2008 opinion : moscow should listen to merkel 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was openly critical of russian actions in the caucasus conflict during talks with president medvedev .
dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2008 opinion : moscow should listen to merkel 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was openly critical of russian actions in the caucasus conflict during talks with president medvedev .
dw 's ingo mannteufel says moscow would do well to heed the tough yet nuanced message . nobody could have guessed that german chancellor angela 's merkel 's visit to the black sea resort of sochi for talks with russian president dimitry medvedev , planned weeks ago , would turn into such an important meeting . georgian president mikheil saakashvili provided the trigger when he attempted to win back the moscow-backed rebel region of south ossetia with military force .
russia did n't just strike back at the georgian attackers but also used the occasion to invade the country by pushing deep into key georgian towns with tanks and artillery . frank words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel it was this military reaction of moscow 's that chancellor merkel criticized as " disproportionate " after meeting with medvedev .
merkel urged russia to immediately implement the six-point french-brokered peace plan and to withdraw troops from georgia proper in the same unambiguous yet diplomatic manner .
in typical fashion , medvedev justified russia 's actions , yet he would do well to heed merkel 's nuanced message . instead of scrapping merkel 's visit to sochi - as german opposition politicians had demanded - the fact that it took place is a sign of the good cooperation with russia that the german government is striving for . merkel used the visit to underline that it is important for her to keep talking to russia even in difficult times .
that is not a given if you look at the reactions of some other eu and nato member states . indirect warnings at the same time , medvedev and the russian leadership should not assume that german foreign policy will always react in a constructive and ready-to-compromise manner toward russia simply because the two countries have robust economic ties .
the german-russian relationship is by all means fragile and prone to change . that 's what the german chancellor hinted at when she issued indirect warnings to russia in a calm and almost reserved manner at the joint press conference in sochi after talks with medvedev . merkel made it clear - in a way that is not typical of her - that ukraine and georgia would become members of nato .
it 's only the timing of their membership that 's still unclear , she said .
this statement of merkel 's does not categorically reject nato 's expansion as early as december . in addition , merkel made it unmistakably clear that she shares the american view that the planned us missile defense shield in poland and the czech republic is not aimed against russia . both those statements by merkel were n't a coincidence , rather they were an intended result of the meeting with medvedev . clear limits on the one hand , the german chancellor made it clear through her visit how important cooperation and good relations with russia are .
on this , merkel apparently differs from the us and eastern european countries who demand a tougher stance toward russia . on the other hand , the chancellor underlined not just where the limits have been reached but where they have already been crossed - namely that the partial occupation of georgia by russian troops and the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighboring country does not fit into a germany-russia strategy that is based on cooperation . the kremlin must have understood this message of merkel 's today . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .

russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three former raf terrorists convicted in the 1977 murder of attorney general siegfried buback wo n't have to serve an additional sentence for refusing to give further testimony in the case , ruled germany 's highest court . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe decided friday , aug .
15 , that former red army faction terrorists christian klar , brigitte mohnhaupt and knut folkerts would not receive an added prison sentence of up to six months , thus overturning a ruling by the investigating judge . all three members of the left-wing terrorist group , which was active in germany in the 1970s and 1980s , were convicted for taking part in the murder of buback and his two companions . had the additional sentence been upheld , klar 's time in prison would have been extended .
mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .
it remains highly disputed whether former members of terrorist organizations can be forced to testify against fellow members after having served their sentence . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three former raf terrorists convicted in the 1977 murder of attorney general siegfried buback wo n't have to serve an additional sentence for refusing to give further testimony in the case , ruled germany 's highest court . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe decided friday , aug .
15 , that former red army faction terrorists christian klar , brigitte mohnhaupt and knut folkerts would not receive an added prison sentence of up to six months , thus overturning a ruling by the investigating judge . all three members of the left-wing terrorist group , which was active in germany in the 1970s and 1980s , were convicted for taking part in the murder of buback and his two companions . had the additional sentence been upheld , klar 's time in prison would have been extended .
mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .
it remains highly disputed whether former members of terrorist organizations can be forced to testify against fellow members after having served their sentence . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , but the change of coach from the experienced ottmar hitzfeld to 44-year-old klinsmann could provide an opportunity for the bavarians ' leading rivals . bayern won last year 's title at a trot , enjoying a 10-point gap over second-placed werder bremen , and klinsmann can rely on basically the same set of players with the exception of veteran goalkeeper oliver kahn , who has retired , has been replaced by the young michael rensing . unlike last season 's 70 million euro -lrb- $ 104 million -rrb- shopping spree , munich have foregone the transfer market for the 2008-09 season .
midfielder tim borowski , arriving on a free transfer from bremen , is the only newcomer of note .
instead the club has splurged on former international striker klinsmann and his coaching staff . stars on the bayern bench klinsmann , who took germany to third place in the 2006 world cup , wants a swifter , more attacking game from bayern , but it may take time for his methods to bear fruit and could open up opportunities for the likes of bremen and schalke . bayern 's pre-season form has been patchy , with training marked by injuries and the late arrival of their euro 2008 internationals . bayern 's opener against hamburg on friday will also be marked by prominent holes in the star-studded lineup .. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern stars ribery and toni wo n't be playing against hamburg striker luca toni , midfielder franck ribery , defenders willy sagnol , martin demichelis and midfielder hamit altintop have all been ruled out against hamburg while argentina midfielder jose ernesto sosa and brazilian defender breno are away competing for their national teams at the olympics . bayern struggled to overcome third division rot-weiss erfurt in the german cup on sunday , but klinsmann said he was confident of an improvement before his team takes the field against hamburg . " we have worked on the mistakes against erfurt , " he said .
" we have done a lot in the tactical area and what 's only lacking now is the fine-tuning . " hamburg , who finished fourth last season , also start with a new coach , 52-year-old dutchman martin jol , who played nine games for bayern in the 1978-79 season . jol has to compensate for the loss of dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart to real madrid , but the northern side have looked solid in pre-season matches and put up a decent show at the recently concluded emirates cup in london against real madrid and juventus . " bayern have had a few problems with their preparations and we have some good results despite one two small difficulties , " jol said .
" we know they 've got some player problems .
ribery is out , and toni , demichelis and sagnol are also injured , but we 've also seen that they 've got other good players . " bremen confident , schalke hopes to end drought meanwhile bremen 's brazilian defender naldo believes the club is better placed than last season to challenge for the title . " the team is top fit , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" unlike last season we have no injury complaints apart from per mertesacker . " germany defender mertesacker , who suffered a cartilage injury in training that required surgery , will be sidelined for several weeks .
bremen are also missing brazil midfielder diego , who is at the olympics , for their game saturday against arminia bielefeld . schalke , who placed third last season , begin the season on saturday at home against hanover under new dutch coach fred rutten .
the side will be hoping to end their 50-year title drought - the last time they lifted a league trophy was in the pre-bundesliga era . gelsenkirchen too may be without peru striker jefferson farfan , a major new signing along with dutch midfielder orlando engelaar , who suffered a shoulder injury in the 1-0 victory wednesday against atletico madrid in a champions league qualifying match . all eyes on hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim and its famous millionare club owner , sap 's dietmar hopp have created a stir with their promotion wolfsburg , who finished fifth last term , take on newly-promoted cologne at home , having spent more than 25 million euros on new players . bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund duel under new coaches , with bruno labbadia now in charge at leverkusen and juergen klopp on the bench at dortmund . in other matches saturday , promoted hoffenheim are at energie cottbus , and karlsruhe take on bochum . sunday 's matches see eintracht frankfurt battle hertha berlin while promoted borussia moenchenglach meet vfb stuttgart . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .
russia would continue discussions on the issue with " all actors , " the president said , while warning that the us move did not contribute to calm .
merkel insisted the shield was not directed at russia but was rather protection against countries like iran .
missile deal makes poland a target , says military chief this was not the view from the kremlin which reiterated its belief that the shield was aimed at moscow while a russian military spokesperson went further by saying that washington 's deal with warsaw made poland " 100 percent " a target for russia 's military .
" the agreement 's content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia , " the interfax news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nogovitsyn warned that targets will be destroyed interfax also reported that anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of russia 's general staff , had talked of poland in terms of a military strike .
" by putting up interceptors , poland is placing itself at risk .
in terms of priority , such targets are the first to be destroyed , " the interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
us and polish diplomats agreed on stationing 10 interceptors in poland in return for us military aid for the poles , including patriot air defense missiles .
nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .
accord increase risk of severe tensions the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said the us-polish deal would not boost security in europe and could lead to " to a real increase in tension in russian-american relations , " interfax reported late thursday .

lavrov mulls over his poland visit russian foreign minister sergei lavrov cancelled a planned september trip to poland hours after the deal was struck thursday , poland 's pap news agency said .
however , poland still expects the scheduled visit to take place , the foreign ministry said friday .
poland 's foreign ministry has no official word that lavrov has called off the visit , local media quoted a ministry spokesman as saying .
deputy foreign minister ryszard schnepf added that poland expects him and has many things to discuss with the moscow diplomat .
" i can only say that russia has n't called off the visit and we still count that it will come to pass , " schnepf told tvp info .
" lavrov will surely be eagerly greeted here and there are many subjects which we can and even should talk about with the russian federation , " he said .
offer to inspect site still stands , says poland poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski repeated on friday an offer to let russian inspectors inspect the planned us base that will form part of washington 's anti-missile system .
" our offer still stands , " he told polish state television station tvp3 .
" we want russia to be able to have the possibility , if it so desires , to inspect the future base " in poland .
the czech government welcomed the deal to base us missile interceptors in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm topolanek and condi rice made progress in july " we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement , which is also good for the czech republic and nato , " deputy foreign minister tomas pojar told the dpa news agency .
he questioned the comments from moscow which suggested the agreement was reached hastily in response to russia 's military assault on pro-western georgia .
" it would have happened even without the events in georgia , " pojar said , adding he was n't surprised that foreign minister sergei lavrov had reportedly cancelled his planned trip to poland .

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .

" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .

" i have to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate , " merkel said at the joint news conference at the black sea resort of sochi , close to the georgian border and the moscow-backed rebel region of abkhazia , the chancellor said russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper and reiterated her position that georgia 's sovereignty could not be called into question . " the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia , " merkel said .
medvedev to present evidence of georgian atrocities the meeting between merkel and medvedev came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan . earlier , russia 's ambassador to berlin vladimir kotenev told germany 's bild tabloid that medvedev would present merkel with evidence of georgian atrocities . " women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set on fire and entire villages were razed , " said kotenev . the ambassador added that medvedev would warn merkel against the influence of the eu 's eastern european members on the bloc 's policy toward russia . delicate balancing act though friday 's meeting was planned before the caucasus crisis broke out , talks between merkel and medvedev were expected to focus almost exclusively on the conflict with georgia .
the german chancellor hopes that she will be able to convince her russian counterpart to avoid any further violence , remove all russian troops from georgian territory and aim for lasting peace . " two points are sacrosanct for germany , " merkel 's spokesman thomas steg told reporters in berlin on wednesday .
" the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks .
the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government . " at the same time , experts hope merkel 's even-handed approach will make russia more open towards the chancellor 's message expected to be delivered in private to medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire , accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing , international peace force in the region , " ruprecht polenz , a veteran member of merkel 's conservative party and head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament told dw-radio . a day earlier , polenz told news agency reuters the eu should bind russia closer to the bloc and consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz told reuters , adding it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its conflict with georgia . german fm calls for even-handed approach german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile said on thursday , aug .
14 , the european union should maintain an even-handed approach to the conflict between russia and georgia if it wanted to play a constructive role in forging long-lasting peace in the caucasus . " it remains the case that a level-headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region , " steinmeier told reporters after a meeting of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee . " we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past , including with clear words when necessary towards russia ... with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia-proper , " steinmeier said . the foreign minister warned that the eu had to keep talking to both sides if it hoped to calm the crisis . " we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic , " steinmeier said on german television .
" if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region , if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis-hit region , then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow . " divisions in eu over dealing with russia his comments came a day after eu ministers agreed to consider sending a mission to monitor a fragile french-brokered peace deal between russia and georgia . but divisions have emerged in the european union over the best way to deal with moscow after fierce fighting erupted between georgia and russia last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to deal with russia after it pushed into georgian territory many new eu members have condemned russia 's violent push into georgia and want the eu to scrap talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership that would enhance political and economic cooperation . the united states , a strong backer of georgia , and britain have slammed russia 's military campaign against georgia and have blamed it for the clashes that broke out between russian and georgian forces in the breakaway region of south ossetia . " to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states , europe , and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " us president george w. bush said this week .
" the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia . " moscow has reacted by warning washington it would have to choose between partnership with the kremlin or supporting georgia . germany avoids blaming moscow steinmeier 's comments , however , reflect a more nuanced attitude in germany towards moscow in the current conflict . german politicians , including merkel , have carefully avoided assigning blame in the conflict .
the country , which is heavily dependant on russian energy supplies , is a strong advocate of closer ties with moscow .

merkel criticized much of moscow 's war while medvedev again warned georgia . medvedev stood firm and justified russia 's military action in georgia , calling it humanitarian intervention and warned that if pressed russia would respond in the same way again .
" if our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked , we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded .
let there be no doubt about this , " medvedev said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in the black sea resort of sochi friday , aug .
15 .
medvedev insisted that russia was " the guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region " and that russian troops would remain in georgia .
the russian president expressed renewed support for the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , where russian troops are stationed .
" after what has happened , ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians , " he said .
merkel described russia 's military action in sending troops into south ossetia and further into central georgia around the city of gori as " in some aspects disproportionate . "
merkel said she had " to say that i found some of russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible .
russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia . "
but she acknowledged some of the russian actions were reasonable .
" both sides are probably to blame , " she said .
georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .
bildunterschrift : the issue of georgia and nato was tackled with merkel reiterating the west 's stance in a clear attack on saakashvili , medvedev said the main issue was to " restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas . "
" we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years , " the russian president said .
medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .
russian general : troops pulling out , ceasefire holding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are allegedly pulling out of georgia in developments elsewhere , the russian military 's general staff in moscow announced that russian and georgian troops have largely withdrawn from the south ossetia conflict zone .
both sides are therefore complying with the terms of the ceasefire declaration , deputy chief of staff general anatoly nogowizyn said as reported by the interfax news agency .
the general criticized georgian troops , alleging they had mined a number of civilian areas prior to their return to barracks .
nogowizyn also rebuffed georgian claims that russian troops had largely destroyed the town of gori .
" on thursday there were 120 journalists , foreign diplomats , and members of the orthodox clergy in the town .
none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described . "
according to nogowizyn , the conditions in the six-point framework plan which was drafted by french president nicholas sarkozy with russian president dmitry medvedev have already been fulfilled .
" there is no new violence , and the ceasefire is fundamentally intact .
meanwhile there is free passage for aid agencies , " the general said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgia 's territorial integrity a key point to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said some russian actions were " disproportionate " the german chancellor called for russian troops to withdraw from central georgia to the sites set out in a six-point european union plan put forward by president nicolas sarkozy under france 's eu presidency .
" the basic point for a political solution must be georgia 's territorial integrity , " merkel said .
sarkozy traveled to moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi on tuesday and wednesday to broker a cessation in the hostilities and to sketch a program for a lasting ceasefire .
" we agreed with french president sarkozy 's main principles for resolving the conflict ...
these principles must be accepted by the georgian side , " medvedev said .
merkel stressed the need for both peacekeepers and observers to be stationed in the crisis region .
nato offer still on the table , merkel says she noted that there was a democratically elected government in tbilisi and insisted that each country had the right to decide whether it wanted to apply for membership of nato , the us-led western alliance .
" the agreements reached in bucharest remain valid , " merkel said , referring to the alliance 's summit held in the romanian capital in april .
" georgia and ukraine could be members of nato , we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains , " merkel added .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has set a clear course for nato membership , against strong objections from moscow .

medvedev wants to avoid new cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to avoid falling out with the west but he also said russia wanted good relations with the eu and the united states .
" we do n't want a long- or short-term warming of relations with the european union , with the united states , or with other countries , " he said .
" we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties , " medvedev said .
both leaders regretted the loss of life and widespread destruction in the conflict , with merkel calling for international observers and aid to be allowed into georgia .
" we are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers , " medvedev replied .
in remarks published as merkel was heading for sochi , russia 's ambassador to berlin , vladimir kotenev , told mass-circulation german newspaper bild that medvedev would present evidence to merkel of georgian atrocities .
" women and children were murdered , churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed , " he told the paper merkel said evidence had been presented but this was unnecessary as " every war is terrible . "
ahead of the visit , merkel made clear that georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity had to be respected , echoing the line taken by us president george w bush .
as merkel was meeting medvedev , us secretary of state condoleezza rice was in georgia to show support for the pro-western government of president mikheil saakashvili and discuss a peace plan .
merkel is to travel to the georgian capital of tbilisi on sunday to hold talks with saakashvili .

following discussions on the situation in georgia with german chancellor angela merkel on friday aug .
15 , medvedev said further talks were needed .
the decision taken thursday by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " medvedev said .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent , " he told a joint press conference after the meeting in sochi on the black sea .
russia would continue discussions on the issue with " all actors , " the president said , while warning that the us move did not contribute to calm .
merkel insisted the shield was not directed at russia but was rather protection against countries like iran .
missile deal makes poland a target , says military chief this was not the view from the kremlin which reiterated its belief that the shield was aimed at moscow while a russian military spokesperson went further by saying that washington 's deal with warsaw made poland " 100 percent " a target for russia 's military .
" the agreement 's content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia , " the interfax news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nogovitsyn warned that targets will be destroyed interfax also reported that anatoly nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of russia 's general staff , had talked of poland in terms of a military strike .
" by putting up interceptors , poland is placing itself at risk .
in terms of priority , such targets are the first to be destroyed , " the interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
us and polish diplomats agreed on stationing 10 interceptors in poland in return for us military aid for the poles , including patriot air defense missiles .
nogovitsyn also referred to russia 's nuclear arms doctrine in case of war , under which he said any elements of a foreign anti-missile shield are included on moscow 's target list .
russia fervently opposes the missile shield , despite us assurances that it counters threats from countries like iran and is too small to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent , which comprises several thousand warheads atop long-range missiles .
accord increase risk of severe tensions the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said the us-polish deal would not boost security in europe and could lead to " to a real increase in tension in russian-american relations , " interfax reported late thursday .

lavrov mulls over his poland visit russian foreign minister sergei lavrov cancelled a planned september trip to poland hours after the deal was struck thursday , poland 's pap news agency said .
however , poland still expects the scheduled visit to take place , the foreign ministry said friday .
poland 's foreign ministry has no official word that lavrov has called off the visit , local media quoted a ministry spokesman as saying .
deputy foreign minister ryszard schnepf added that poland expects him and has many things to discuss with the moscow diplomat .
" i can only say that russia has n't called off the visit and we still count that it will come to pass , " schnepf told tvp info .
" lavrov will surely be eagerly greeted here and there are many subjects which we can and even should talk about with the russian federation , " he said .
offer to inspect site still stands , says poland poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski repeated on friday an offer to let russian inspectors inspect the planned us base that will form part of washington 's anti-missile system .
" our offer still stands , " he told polish state television station tvp3 .
" we want russia to be able to have the possibility , if it so desires , to inspect the future base " in poland .
the czech government welcomed the deal to base us missile interceptors in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm topolanek and condi rice made progress in july " we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement , which is also good for the czech republic and nato , " deputy foreign minister tomas pojar told the dpa news agency .
he questioned the comments from moscow which suggested the agreement was reached hastily in response to russia 's military assault on pro-western georgia .
" it would have happened even without the events in georgia , " pojar said , adding he was n't surprised that foreign minister sergei lavrov had reportedly cancelled his planned trip to poland .

15 , but the change of coach from the experienced ottmar hitzfeld to 44-year-old klinsmann could provide an opportunity for the bavarians ' leading rivals . bayern won last year 's title at a trot , enjoying a 10-point gap over second-placed werder bremen , and klinsmann can rely on basically the same set of players with the exception of veteran goalkeeper oliver kahn , who has retired , has been replaced by the young michael rensing . unlike last season 's 70 million euro -lrb- $ 104 million -rrb- shopping spree , munich have foregone the transfer market for the 2008-09 season .
midfielder tim borowski , arriving on a free transfer from bremen , is the only newcomer of note .
instead the club has splurged on former international striker klinsmann and his coaching staff . stars on the bayern bench klinsmann , who took germany to third place in the 2006 world cup , wants a swifter , more attacking game from bayern , but it may take time for his methods to bear fruit and could open up opportunities for the likes of bremen and schalke . bayern 's pre-season form has been patchy , with training marked by injuries and the late arrival of their euro 2008 internationals . bayern 's opener against hamburg on friday will also be marked by prominent holes in the star-studded lineup .. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern stars ribery and toni wo n't be playing against hamburg striker luca toni , midfielder franck ribery , defenders willy sagnol , martin demichelis and midfielder hamit altintop have all been ruled out against hamburg while argentina midfielder jose ernesto sosa and brazilian defender breno are away competing for their national teams at the olympics . bayern struggled to overcome third division rot-weiss erfurt in the german cup on sunday , but klinsmann said he was confident of an improvement before his team takes the field against hamburg . " we have worked on the mistakes against erfurt , " he said .
" we have done a lot in the tactical area and what 's only lacking now is the fine-tuning . " hamburg , who finished fourth last season , also start with a new coach , 52-year-old dutchman martin jol , who played nine games for bayern in the 1978-79 season . jol has to compensate for the loss of dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart to real madrid , but the northern side have looked solid in pre-season matches and put up a decent show at the recently concluded emirates cup in london against real madrid and juventus . " bayern have had a few problems with their preparations and we have some good results despite one two small difficulties , " jol said .
" we know they 've got some player problems .
ribery is out , and toni , demichelis and sagnol are also injured , but we 've also seen that they 've got other good players . " bremen confident , schalke hopes to end drought meanwhile bremen 's brazilian defender naldo believes the club is better placed than last season to challenge for the title . " the team is top fit , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" unlike last season we have no injury complaints apart from per mertesacker . " germany defender mertesacker , who suffered a cartilage injury in training that required surgery , will be sidelined for several weeks .
bremen are also missing brazil midfielder diego , who is at the olympics , for their game saturday against arminia bielefeld . schalke , who placed third last season , begin the season on saturday at home against hanover under new dutch coach fred rutten .
the side will be hoping to end their 50-year title drought - the last time they lifted a league trophy was in the pre-bundesliga era . gelsenkirchen too may be without peru striker jefferson farfan , a major new signing along with dutch midfielder orlando engelaar , who suffered a shoulder injury in the 1-0 victory wednesday against atletico madrid in a champions league qualifying match . all eyes on hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim and its famous millionare club owner , sap 's dietmar hopp have created a stir with their promotion wolfsburg , who finished fifth last term , take on newly-promoted cologne at home , having spent more than 25 million euros on new players . bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund duel under new coaches , with bruno labbadia now in charge at leverkusen and juergen klopp on the bench at dortmund . in other matches saturday , promoted hoffenheim are at energie cottbus , and karlsruhe take on bochum . sunday 's matches see eintracht frankfurt battle hertha berlin while promoted borussia moenchenglach meet vfb stuttgart . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three former raf terrorists convicted in the 1977 murder of attorney general siegfried buback wo n't have to serve an additional sentence for refusing to give further testimony in the case , ruled germany 's highest court . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe decided friday , aug .
15 , that former red army faction terrorists christian klar , brigitte mohnhaupt and knut folkerts would not receive an added prison sentence of up to six months , thus overturning a ruling by the investigating judge . all three members of the left-wing terrorist group , which was active in germany in the 1970s and 1980s , were convicted for taking part in the murder of buback and his two companions . had the additional sentence been upheld , klar 's time in prison would have been extended .
mohnhaupt and folkerts , who have already been released , would have returned to prison for coercive detention . buback murders reopened more than 30 years after the buback murders , an investigation was reopened when raf defector peter-juergen boock came forward saying that former raf member stefan wisniewski - not folkerts , as previously thought - had pulled the trigger in the buback murders . wisniewski was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of german business leader hanns-martin schleyer , but had not been convicted in the buback murders . the investigating judge had imposed the additional sentence on klar , mohnhaupt and folkert in an attempt to force the former raf-members to testify again concerning buback 's killer . the sentence was overturned friday after all three filed an official complaint with the federal court of justice .
it remains highly disputed whether former members of terrorist organizations can be forced to testify against fellow members after having served their sentence . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" before the race my coach told me you need to swim your own race and that the others would start very fast , " she said .
" i decided to close my eyes and just go for it and i think it worked quite well . " after touching the pad in a time of 53.12 , she did not turn around to look at the results board , embracing trickett , who had swum in the lane next to hers instead . " at that moment i did not really know what had happened , " steffen said .
" i just wanted to enjoy the moment and i thought that even if i did not win a medal , i swam a wonderful race .
but then when i looked at the board i saw that i had won and everything was brilliant . " steffen said after her victory that credit must go to psychologist friederike janofske , with whom she has been working for a long time . " she has managed to bring out the best in me , " she said . the 24-year-old said that she thinks it also helped her that the german swim team had - so far - bombed out at the olympics . " there was very little pressure on me , " she said .
" my world record was gone , i had not done well in the relay and nobody really thought i was going to win a medal . bildunterschrift : steffen disappointed at the 2000 olympics , but friday showed that she has what it takes gold for three us swimmers superstar michael phelps set the benchmark for overall medals a little bit higher when he won his sixth gold medal of the competition and his 12th gold overall , to go three clear of four athletes with nine all-time olympic golds . phelps took his world record tally to six with his victory in the men 's 200-meter individual medley in a time of 1:54.23 seconds . american ryan lochte won the men 's 200-meter backstroke in a world record time of 1:53.94 - just 20 minutes before winning bronze in the 200 im - while fellow american rebecca soni took the women 's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:20.22 seconds , also in world record time . in the men 's 200-meter im , the medals went to the same swimmers who also stood on the podium in the same order for the 400-meter im , with phelps being followed by hungarian laszlo cseh and lochte . phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.80 that he established at the us trials last month . " i just wanted to step on it in the first 50-meter a little bit and try to get out to an early lead , " he said .
" i knew that it was a hard double for ryan -lrb- lochte -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.08.2008 indian surrogacy in the eye of the storm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emiko yamada looks at her 11-day-old granddaughter manji yamada , born to an indian surrogate mother surrogacy has been in the news recently because of a spate of commercial surrogacies in india .
the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .
i would say if it is a free contract between consenting adults it should not be a matter of breast beating . ’ ’
presently , there are no clear strictures regarding commercial surrogacy in india .
fearing that the country could become what she calls a “ cheap-deal-hub ” for surrogacy , the women and child development minister renuka chaudhary has called for stronger laws against the practice .
but dr kadam feels such fears are unfounded : “ i think we would be overreacting .
commercial surrogacy is very new and within a very short span of time it has gained a lot of importance . ”
the complicated case of manji yamada one case that has attracted huge media attention is that of manji yamada .
born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .
he and his wife divorced shortly before manji 's birth .
the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’
but even if manji can not yet leave indian shores , the supreme court has allowed her to be under the care of her grandmother emiko yamada , who has travelled to india .
although there are no clear statistics about the exact number of surrogate mothers and babies born per year , experts estimate there could be hundreds in india .

the complicated case of manji yamada one case that has attracted huge media attention is that of manji yamada .
born to an indian surrogate , manji 's biological father is japanese .
he and his wife divorced shortly before manji 's birth .
the japanese mother-to-be disowned manji but the father wanted to keep her .
however , since indian laws do not allow adoption by single fathers , manji 's case got caught in a legal limbo .
a recent writ petition filed in the rajasthan high court by the delhi-based ngo satya forbade manji from being taken out of the country .
speaking about the case , dr sanjay agarwal of satya said he feared commercial surrogacy would adversely affect adoption practices amongst childless couples : ‘ ’ if there is no law , how did they do it ?
this is the main issue .
in india , there are a number of abandoned children and they have to be adopted by some kind of parents . ’ ’
but even if manji can not yet leave indian shores , the supreme court has allowed her to be under the care of her grandmother emiko yamada , who has travelled to india .

the practice of commercial surrogacy , which basically means renting a womb to carry a child for someone else , is banned in most western countries .
not in india , where a recent complicated case has brought the matter into the spotlight - that of manji yamada , a japanese child born to an indian surrogate mother , pritiben mehta , and disowned by her japanese mother-to-be .
manji ’ s fate now lies with the indian courts . according to experts indian surrogates earn within a range of 2000-2500 euros per surrogacy .
dr kaushal kadam of the rotunda clinic in mumbai said that his sum of money can significantly change surrogate mothers ' lives for the better : “ most of them belong to the middle lower-middle class of society and are doing this to improve their standard of living ; to buy a better house , or put their kid in a better school .
this is a good thing for them . ’ ’
this opinion is seconded by madhu kishwar , a leading indian feminist and the editor of manushi magazine , who feels that so long as there is no abuse the matter should not be open for public speculation : “ given the fact that a lot of couples who want children can ’ t , it ’ s a need-based arrangement .
i would say if it is a free contract between consenting adults it should not be a matter of breast beating . ’ ’

the fact remains india became independent due to the efforts of the people two generations ago and we are lucky to be born in a free country .
the next generation has let the country down a little , but the current one seems more determined than ever , leading to this mixed feeling .
economic statistics are cyclical and is one issue , but so much needs to be done .
we have to accommodate the hundreds of millions of ambitious young people who are going to become adults and deserve the best opportunities to bring out their talent .
let 's build roads first , castles in the air later if that does n't happen , ambition will turn to frustration .
yet , the country with the average age of 25 years continues to be run by 75-year-old people more interested in hoarding and keeping their power than understanding the country 's needs .
new leadership yes , we need new leadership .
we also need young people not to shy away from discussing politics in college canteens .
if we can discuss bollywood stars katrina kaif and ashwariya rai 's dresses , we can discuss party ideologies .
yes , i know discussions wo n't change anything but it helps build consensus .
politics is an option for me , but there is no point jumping in the fray without a support base .
god has chosen my destiny and if it is part of the plan , i will join politics someday .
but i 'm upbeat about the future too .
i am optimistic because the sheer numbers of the young population will make them an important voice in running the country eventually .
' the young will be an important voice in running the country eventually ' this generation is also more homogenous in their purpose .
they more focused on their own and thereby , india 's progress rather being lost in issues of religion , caste and regionalism which frankly have cost the country a lot .
the power of the internet will bring young people together , and do n't be surprised if there is another social revolution in india in the next 20 years .
after all , china had one and only then it went on a path of true progress .
the biggest positive is that more and more people have tasted the benefits of economic growth and realise that it is the only way forward .
this consensus is our biggest strength .
while money ca n't buy everything - it can buy india a lot .
division between people imagine if india was a developed country , our biggest problems - poverty , healthcare , infrastructure , child labour- will be gone .
alongside , there will be lesser religious tension or caste differences .
if you have a nice home and a toyota corolla , it is unlikely you will go and riot on the streets .
there are countries in the world where everyone has a car - and now for the first time in india 's history , people are saying ' why ca n't it be my country ? '
the biggest negative is the division between people .
there is still a clinging on to one 's caste , region and religion between people .
the feeling of one india is there , but it does n't override the other aspects of one 's identity .
politicians love this , as this gives neat little clubs to claim support from and people fall for it every time .
' india is not likely to be a superpower in near future ' until all of us are ready to say " india first and the rest is secondary " , not just in lip service but from the heart , things will not change .
this is what depresses me .
we should also remember india is not a superpower and is not likely to be in the near future .
and we should stop putting these tags on india every time the stock market gives good returns because it reeks of low self-esteem .
let 's build roads first , castles in the air later .
comparing india with the rest of the world is not a healthy exercise .
we should put our heads down and work for a better country for the next 30 years .
hopefully , we will no longer be one of the poorest countries in the world and become a developed one .
and if we can do that , we would have matched up to the coolest indian generation who got us free .
hopefully , we will have another 15 august sometime in the future , when not only india but indians will become free .
when that happens , we will take our rightful place in the world which we have been denied for the last few centuries .

he was speaking at independence day celebrations in the capital , delhi .
hundreds of thousands of security personnel have been deployed across india following a series of bomb blasts in the past few months .
there have also been violent protests more recently in indian-administered kashmir where muslim separatists called for a boycott of the celebrations .
in his traditional independence day address made from delhi 's historic red fort , mr singh said : " terrorism , extremism , communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country . "
he said india needed to strengthen its intelligence services and police forces to deal with terrorism .
biggest concern but mr singh 's biggest concern is the growing violence in indian-administered kashmir , with more than 20 people killed in the past week .
the region has witnessed the biggest protests since a separatist rebellion broke out nearly two decades ago .
" in this hour of crisis , divisive politics will lead us nowhere .
i appeal to all political parties to keep the long-term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state , " he said .
security is intense in kashmir as well as the rest of india , with hundreds of thousands of forces deployed to prevent any possible violence .
kashmir has been rocked by violence recently mr singh said that the recent attack on india 's embassy in kabul had cast a shadow on india 's ties with pakistan .
this is the prime minister 's last independence day speech ahead of the next general elections , due in eight months .
he outlined a number of measures aimed at improving the country 's economy .
his government is under pressure with annual inflation at a 13-year high .
" the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors , " mr singh said .
" all over the world and in global markets the price of food , fuel and other commodities has been rising .
in many developing countries the rate of inflation is double that in india . "

hundreds of thousands of security personnel have been deployed across india following a series of bomb blasts in the past few months .
there have also been violent protests more recently in indian-administered kashmir where muslim separatists called for a boycott of the celebrations .
in his traditional independence day address made from delhi 's historic red fort , mr singh said : " terrorism , extremism , communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country . "
he said india needed to strengthen its intelligence services and police forces to deal with terrorism .
biggest concern but mr singh 's biggest concern is the growing violence in indian-administered kashmir , with more than 20 people killed in the past week .
the region has witnessed the biggest protests since a separatist rebellion broke out nearly two decades ago .
" in this hour of crisis , divisive politics will lead us nowhere .
i appeal to all political parties to keep the long-term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state , " he said .
security is intense in kashmir as well as the rest of india , with hundreds of thousands of forces deployed to prevent any possible violence .
kashmir has been rocked by violence recently mr singh said that the recent attack on india 's embassy in kabul had cast a shadow on india 's ties with pakistan .
this is the prime minister 's last independence day speech ahead of the next general elections , due in eight months .
he outlined a number of measures aimed at improving the country 's economy .
his government is under pressure with annual inflation at a 13-year high .

there have also been violent protests more recently in indian-administered kashmir where muslim separatists called for a boycott of the celebrations .
in his traditional independence day address made from delhi 's historic red fort , mr singh said : " terrorism , extremism , communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country . "
he said india needed to strengthen its intelligence services and police forces to deal with terrorism .
biggest concern but mr singh 's biggest concern is the growing violence in indian-administered kashmir , with more than 20 people killed in the past week .
the region has witnessed the biggest protests since a separatist rebellion broke out nearly two decades ago .
" in this hour of crisis , divisive politics will lead us nowhere .
i appeal to all political parties to keep the long-term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state , " he said .
security is intense in kashmir as well as the rest of india , with hundreds of thousands of forces deployed to prevent any possible violence .
mr singh said that the recent attack on india 's embassy in kabul had cast a shadow on india 's ties with pakistan .
this is the prime minister 's last independence day speech ahead of the next general elections , due in eight months .
he outlined a number of measures aimed at improving the country 's economy .
his government is under pressure with annual inflation at a 13-year high .
" the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors , " mr singh said .
" all over the world and in global markets the price of food , fuel and other commodities has been rising .
in many developing countries the rate of inflation is double that in india . "

i was 21 years old , i had just graduated from university with a degree that really should have been better , and i was spending the summer at home to gather my thoughts about what the big wide world would hold for me .
with nothing much happening , i was happy to work a day in a friend 's shop while they were on holiday .
i was filling in for another member of staff and it was my first day on the job .
it turned out to be a very quiet day money-wise , my friend and i were fretting that the owners would come home to a bad day 's takings .
but then at about 2pm business started to pick up .
more and more people came into the shop - when we asked a customer about the increase in numbers down ' our end ' of the town we were told about a bomb-scare up at the courthouse .
we had no fear and were glad to hear the till ringing a bit more frequently .
in my 21 years , i had lived a life removed from the troubles - yes i saw it on tv but it never came too close .
i was a protestant who had been brought up to have friends of both faiths , some of my first friends were the children of my parents ' catholic friends .
it was n't until i went to primary school that i really gained protestant friends .
i had spent the previous three years telling my university friends in england that northern ireland really was n't that bad anymore and that i lived in a quiet little town , where nothing really happened and where pretty much everyone got along .
explosion then on 15 august my life changed .
as market street got busier , i would take it in turns with my co-worker to go out on to the street and look up toward the courthouse to see if anything was happening .
we were not to know that every time we stepped outside the shop 's front door we were within a couple of feet of a car that was packed with 500lbs of explosives .
the next thing i remember is the darkness , the dust and then the screaming .
to this day i ca n't remember the sound of the explosion , although bombs in films and on television kick-start something in my brain and i 'm taken right back to that moment .
my friend and i were okay , we had been standing half-way up what was a very narrow shop , so the full force of the bomb had n't travelled very far up it .
the front of the shop was a mess of rubble .
i do n't remember if there was anybody in that part of the shop when the blast went off .
maybe it 's better that i do n't .
shock there was a side door to the shop , so i was able to get everybody out and into a car-park behind the main street .
we were all obviously in shock but nobody seemed to have life-threatening injuries .
shock makes you do funny things .
twice i went back into the crumbling building , once to look for a pair of shoes i had left behind and then to get the keys to the shop - not realising that this was pointless as there were no doors left to lock .
not long after i was bundled into a car and taken up to the hospital .
the images i saw there will haunt me for the rest of my life .
my dad tracked me down at the hospital .
i was bloodied and bruised but i did n't want to stay there so he sent me home with a neighbour .
he stayed at the hospital to help carry in the injured and to wait for my mum who he knew would eventually make her way there .
my mum had been in dunnes stores at the time of the blast .
for those familiar with omagh , you 'll know this is only around the corner from market street .
she had raced round , witnessed the devastation and began looking for me .
she saw what was left of the shop where i had been working , not knowing i had made it out the back and was safe .
after thinking she had found me amongst the rubble a couple of times , she gave up her search in the town and went the hospital where she found my father who was able to reassure her that i was ok .
i , meanwhile , was at my neighbour 's being fed sherry , valium , sweet tea and cigarettes when my mother burst into the house .
it was the first time she had ever seen me smoking but i think she forgave me .
i can not begin to imagine how horrific for my mum that hour must have been , as she looked for me in market street .
later that night there was a constant stream of visitors at the door , friends and family disbelieving that i could really be ok after being so close .
at about 8pm my mum insisted on taking me back to the hospital .
the left side of my body was covered in a huge black bruise from my shoulder to my bum , there were cuts and bruising to my face and she was worried about any internal injuries .
i was given the all-clear and sent home where i watched with disbelief the scenes that were unfolding on the news , finding it difficult to comprehend that i had been a part of it .
it was n't until the next day that i found out a good friend had been killed .
i had been with her just two nights before and we had made plans to go out on the saturday night .
it had n't occurred to me that any of my friends could have died .
we were 21 , we were meant to invincible .
moving on the next few months passed in a blur .
i could n't sleep and was probably drinking a bit too much .
at night i was having more and more flashbacks that i could n't handle .
i felt guilty for walking away relatively uninjured when others did not .
i was angry with myself that when the police came to speak to me i could remember nothing of the car , despite the fact i had stood so close to it a couple of times .
my mother sent me to my gp who prescribed sleeping tablets , when i went back for a repeat prescription the third time he , very kindly , said no and that i should look into getting some counselling .
it was nearly six months before i took him up on his advice .
therapy was something only americans did , but it helped .
just to vent to a neutral person and to talk things through lifted a lot of the mist from my head .
in the intervening 10 years i hope i have moved on .
this week has been hard , especially working in an office where omagh is seen as a story and there has been much talk of it in the run-up to the anniversary .
there have been many tears shed over the years , but one thing i have learned , and perhaps the most important for me , is that the bombing is a part of my life .
i was there , it has undeniably shaped the life i now have and there is no point trying to get away from it .
so this afternoon i will attend the memorial service to remember those who did not survive and to be thankful that i did .

at night i was having more and more flashbacks that i could n't handle .
i felt guilty for walking away relatively uninjured when others did not .
i was angry with myself that when the police came to speak to me i could remember nothing of the car , despite the fact i had stood so close to it a couple of times .
my mother sent me to my gp who prescribed sleeping tablets , when i went back for a repeat prescription the third time he , very kindly , said no and that i should look into getting some counselling .
it was nearly six months before i took him up on his advice .
therapy was something only americans did , but it helped .
just to vent to a neutral person and to talk things through lifted a lot of the mist from my head .
in the intervening 10 years i hope i have moved on .
this week has been hard , especially working in an office where omagh is seen as a story and there has been much talk of it in the run-up to the anniversary .
there have been many tears shed over the years , but one thing i have learned , and perhaps the most important for me , is that the bombing is a part of my life .
i was there , it has undeniably shaped the life i now have and there is no point trying to get away from it .
so this afternoon i will attend the memorial service to remember those who did not survive and to be thankful that i did .

i was 21 years old , i had just graduated from university with a degree that really should have been better , and i was spending the summer at home to gather my thoughts about what the big wide world would hold for me .
with nothing much happening , i was happy to work a day in a friend 's shop while they were on holiday .
i was filling in for another member of staff and it was my first day on the job .
it turned out to be a very quiet day money-wise , my friend and i were fretting that the owners would come home to a bad day 's takings .
but then at about 2pm business started to pick up .
more and more people came into the shop - when we asked a customer about the increase in numbers down ' our end ' of the town we were told about a bomb-scare up at the courthouse .
we had no fear and were glad to hear the till ringing a bit more frequently .
in my 21 years , i had lived a life removed from the troubles - yes i saw it on tv but it never came too close .
i was a protestant who had been brought up to have friends of both faiths , some of my first friends were the children of my parents ' catholic friends .
it was n't until i went to primary school that i really gained protestant friends .
i had spent the previous three years telling my university friends in england that northern ireland really was n't that bad anymore and that i lived in a quiet little town , where nothing really happened and where pretty much everyone got along .
explosion then on 15 august my life changed .
as market street got busier , i would take it in turns with my co-worker to go out on to the street and look up toward the courthouse to see if anything was happening .
we were not to know that every time we stepped outside the shop 's front door we were within a couple of feet of a car that was packed with 500lbs of explosives .
the next thing i remember is the darkness , the dust and then the screaming .
an artist 's impression of the new memorial garden to this day i ca n't remember the sound of the explosion , although bombs in films and on television kick-start something in my brain and i 'm taken right back to that moment .
my friend and i were okay , we had been standing half-way up what was a very narrow shop , so the full force of the bomb had n't travelled very far up it .
the front of the shop was a mess of rubble .
i do n't remember if there was anybody in that part of the shop when the blast went off .
maybe it 's better that i do n't .
shock there was a side door to the shop , so i was able to get everybody out and into a car-park behind the main street .
we were all obviously in shock but nobody seemed to have life-threatening injuries .
shock makes you do funny things .
twice i went back into the crumbling building , once to look for a pair of shoes i had left behind and then to get the keys to the shop - not realising that this was pointless as there were no doors left to lock .
not long after i was bundled into a car and taken up to the hospital .
the images i saw there will haunt me for the rest of my life .
my dad tracked me down at the hospital .
i was bloodied and bruised but i did n't want to stay there so he sent me home with a neighbour .
he stayed at the hospital to help carry in the injured and to wait for my mum who he knew would eventually make her way there .
my mum had been in dunnes stores at the time of the blast .
for those familiar with omagh , you 'll know this is only around the corner from market street .
she had raced round , witnessed the devastation and began looking for me .
she saw what was left of the shop where i had been working , not knowing i had made it out the back and was safe .
after thinking she had found me amongst the rubble a couple of times , she gave up her search in the town and went the hospital where she found my father who was able to reassure her that i was ok .
i , meanwhile , was at my neighbour 's being fed sherry , valium , sweet tea and cigarettes when my mother burst into the house .
it was the first time she had ever seen me smoking but i think she forgave me .
i can not begin to imagine how horrific for my mum that hour must have been , as she looked for me in market street .
later that night there was a constant stream of visitors at the door , friends and family disbelieving that i could really be ok after being so close .
at about 8pm my mum insisted on taking me back to the hospital .
the left side of my body was covered in a huge black bruise from my shoulder to my bum , there were cuts and bruising to my face and she was worried about any internal injuries .
part of the memorial being installed last month i was given the all-clear and sent home where i watched with disbelief the scenes that were unfolding on the news , finding it difficult to comprehend that i had been a part of it .
it was n't until the next day that i found out a good friend had been killed .
i had been with her just two nights before and we had made plans to go out on the saturday night .
it had n't occurred to me that any of my friends could have died .
we were 21 , we were meant to invincible .
moving on the next few months passed in a blur .
i could n't sleep and was probably drinking a bit too much .
at night i was having more and more flashbacks that i could n't handle .
i felt guilty for walking away relatively uninjured when others did not .

i was 21 years old , i had just graduated from university with a degree that really should have been better , and i was spending the summer at home to gather my thoughts about what the big wide world would hold for me .
with nothing much happening , i was happy to work a day in a friend 's shop while they were on holiday .
i was filling in for another member of staff and it was my first day on the job .
it turned out to be a very quiet day money-wise , my friend and i were fretting that the owners would come home to a bad day 's takings .
but then at about 2pm business started to pick up .
more and more people came into the shop - when we asked a customer about the increase in numbers down ' our end ' of the town we were told about a bomb-scare up at the courthouse .
we had no fear and were glad to hear the till ringing a bit more frequently .
in my 21 years , i had lived a life removed from the troubles - yes i saw it on tv but it never came too close .
i was a protestant who had been brought up to have friends of both faiths , some of my first friends were the children of my parents ' catholic friends .
it was n't until i went to primary school that i really gained protestant friends .
i had spent the previous three years telling my university friends in england that northern ireland really was n't that bad anymore and that i lived in a quiet little town , where nothing really happened and where pretty much everyone got along .
explosion then on 15 august my life changed .
as market street got busier , i would take it in turns with my co-worker to go out on to the street and look up toward the courthouse to see if anything was happening .
we were not to know that every time we stepped outside the shop 's front door we were within a couple of feet of a car that was packed with 500lbs of explosives .
the next thing i remember is the darkness , the dust and then the screaming .
an artist 's impression of the new memorial garden to this day i ca n't remember the sound of the explosion , although bombs in films and on television kick-start something in my brain and i 'm taken right back to that moment .
my friend and i were okay , we had been standing half-way up what was a very narrow shop , so the full force of the bomb had n't travelled very far up it .
the front of the shop was a mess of rubble .
i do n't remember if there was anybody in that part of the shop when the blast went off .
maybe it 's better that i do n't .
shock there was a side door to the shop , so i was able to get everybody out and into a car-park behind the main street .
we were all obviously in shock but nobody seemed to have life-threatening injuries .
shock makes you do funny things .
twice i went back into the crumbling building , once to look for a pair of shoes i had left behind and then to get the keys to the shop - not realising that this was pointless as there were no doors left to lock .
not long after i was bundled into a car and taken up to the hospital .
the images i saw there will haunt me for the rest of my life .
my dad tracked me down at the hospital .
i was bloodied and bruised but i did n't want to stay there so he sent me home with a neighbour .
he stayed at the hospital to help carry in the injured and to wait for my mum who he knew would eventually make her way there .
my mum had been in dunnes stores at the time of the blast .
for those familiar with omagh , you 'll know this is only around the corner from market street .
she had raced round , witnessed the devastation and began looking for me .
she saw what was left of the shop where i had been working , not knowing i had made it out the back and was safe .
after thinking she had found me amongst the rubble a couple of times , she gave up her search in the town and went the hospital where she found my father who was able to reassure her that i was ok .
i , meanwhile , was at my neighbour 's being fed sherry , valium , sweet tea and cigarettes when my mother burst into the house .
it was the first time she had ever seen me smoking but i think she forgave me .
i can not begin to imagine how horrific for my mum that hour must have been , as she looked for me in market street .
later that night there was a constant stream of visitors at the door , friends and family disbelieving that i could really be ok after being so close .
at about 8pm my mum insisted on taking me back to the hospital .
the left side of my body was covered in a huge black bruise from my shoulder to my bum , there were cuts and bruising to my face and she was worried about any internal injuries .
part of the memorial being installed last month i was given the all-clear and sent home where i watched with disbelief the scenes that were unfolding on the news , finding it difficult to comprehend that i had been a part of it .
it was n't until the next day that i found out a good friend had been killed .
i had been with her just two nights before and we had made plans to go out on the saturday night .
it had n't occurred to me that any of my friends could have died .
we were 21 , we were meant to invincible .
moving on the next few months passed in a blur .
i could n't sleep and was probably drinking a bit too much .
at night i was having more and more flashbacks that i could n't handle .
i felt guilty for walking away relatively uninjured when others did not .
i was angry with myself that when the police came to speak to me i could remember nothing of the car , despite the fact i had stood so close to it a couple of times .
my mother sent me to my gp who prescribed sleeping tablets , when i went back for a repeat prescription the third time he , very kindly , said no and that i should look into getting some counselling .
it was nearly six months before i took him up on his advice .
therapy was something only americans did , but it helped .
just to vent to a neutral person and to talk things through lifted a lot of the mist from my head .
in the intervening 10 years i hope i have moved on .
this week has been hard , especially working in an office where omagh is seen as a story and there has been much talk of it in the run-up to the anniversary .
there have been many tears shed over the years , but one thing i have learned , and perhaps the most important for me , is that the bombing is a part of my life .
i was there , it has undeniably shaped the life i now have and there is no point trying to get away from it .
so this afternoon i will attend the memorial service to remember those who did not survive and to be thankful that i did .

i was 21 years old , i had just graduated from university with a degree that really should have been better , and i was spending the summer at home to gather my thoughts about what the big wide world would hold for me .
with nothing much happening , i was happy to work a day in a friend 's shop while they were on holiday .
i was filling in for another member of staff and it was my first day on the job .
it turned out to be a very quiet day money-wise , my friend and i were fretting that the owners would come home to a bad day 's takings .
but then at about 2pm business started to pick up .
more and more people came into the shop - when we asked a customer about the increase in numbers down ' our end ' of the town we were told about a bomb-scare up at the courthouse .
we had no fear and were glad to hear the till ringing a bit more frequently .
in my 21 years , i had lived a life removed from the troubles - yes i saw it on tv but it never came too close .
i was a protestant who had been brought up to have friends of both faiths , some of my first friends were the children of my parents ' catholic friends .
it was n't until i went to primary school that i really gained protestant friends .
i had spent the previous three years telling my university friends in england that northern ireland really was n't that bad anymore and that i lived in a quiet little town , where nothing really happened and where pretty much everyone got along .
explosion then on 15 august my life changed .
as market street got busier , i would take it in turns with my co-worker to go out on to the street and look up toward the courthouse to see if anything was happening .
we were not to know that every time we stepped outside the shop 's front door we were within a couple of feet of a car that was packed with 500lbs of explosives .
the next thing i remember is the darkness , the dust and then the screaming .
an artist 's impression of the new memorial garden to this day i ca n't remember the sound of the explosion , although bombs in films and on television kick-start something in my brain and i 'm taken right back to that moment .
my friend and i were okay , we had been standing half-way up what was a very narrow shop , so the full force of the bomb had n't travelled very far up it .
the front of the shop was a mess of rubble .
i do n't remember if there was anybody in that part of the shop when the blast went off .
maybe it 's better that i do n't .
shock there was a side door to the shop , so i was able to get everybody out and into a car-park behind the main street .
we were all obviously in shock but nobody seemed to have life-threatening injuries .
shock makes you do funny things .
twice i went back into the crumbling building , once to look for a pair of shoes i had left behind and then to get the keys to the shop - not realising that this was pointless as there were no doors left to lock .
not long after i was bundled into a car and taken up to the hospital .
the images i saw there will haunt me for the rest of my life .
my dad tracked me down at the hospital .
i was bloodied and bruised but i did n't want to stay there so he sent me home with a neighbour .
he stayed at the hospital to help carry in the injured and to wait for my mum who he knew would eventually make her way there .
my mum had been in dunnes stores at the time of the blast .
for those familiar with omagh , you 'll know this is only around the corner from market street .
she had raced round , witnessed the devastation and began looking for me .
she saw what was left of the shop where i had been working , not knowing i had made it out the back and was safe .
after thinking she had found me amongst the rubble a couple of times , she gave up her search in the town and went the hospital where she found my father who was able to reassure her that i was ok .
i , meanwhile , was at my neighbour 's being fed sherry , valium , sweet tea and cigarettes when my mother burst into the house .
it was the first time she had ever seen me smoking but i think she forgave me .
i can not begin to imagine how horrific for my mum that hour must have been , as she looked for me in market street .
later that night there was a constant stream of visitors at the door , friends and family disbelieving that i could really be ok after being so close .
at about 8pm my mum insisted on taking me back to the hospital .
the left side of my body was covered in a huge black bruise from my shoulder to my bum , there were cuts and bruising to my face and she was worried about any internal injuries .
part of the memorial being installed last month i was given the all-clear and sent home where i watched with disbelief the scenes that were unfolding on the news , finding it difficult to comprehend that i had been a part of it .
it was n't until the next day that i found out a good friend had been killed .
i had been with her just two nights before and we had made plans to go out on the saturday night .
it had n't occurred to me that any of my friends could have died .
we were 21 , we were meant to invincible .
moving on the next few months passed in a blur .
i could n't sleep and was probably drinking a bit too much .
at night i was having more and more flashbacks that i could n't handle .
i felt guilty for walking away relatively uninjured when others did not .
i was angry with myself that when the police came to speak to me i could remember nothing of the car , despite the fact i had stood so close to it a couple of times .
my mother sent me to my gp who prescribed sleeping tablets , when i went back for a repeat prescription the third time he , very kindly , said no and that i should look into getting some counselling .
it was nearly six months before i took him up on his advice .
therapy was something only americans did , but it helped .
just to vent to a neutral person and to talk things through lifted a lot of the mist from my head .
in the intervening 10 years i hope i have moved on .
this week has been hard , especially working in an office where omagh is seen as a story and there has been much talk of it in the run-up to the anniversary .
there have been many tears shed over the years , but one thing i have learned , and perhaps the most important for me , is that the bombing is a part of my life .
i was there , it has undeniably shaped the life i now have and there is no point trying to get away from it .
so this afternoon i will attend the memorial service to remember those who did not survive and to be thankful that i did .

for security reasons , the author 's name is not being published .
everyday family tragedy violent death in iraq is an everyday event .
in baghdad people put up signs on the street to announce deaths .
i am always surprised to read one which says that someone died of natural causes .
because it is so common , you get used to the number of violent deaths .
the problem is you just bury it deep inside you .
it becomes like a time bomb , you never know when it is going to explode .
all these feelings of fear , sadness and frustration burst out of me one morning last week when i lost marwan , a relative of mine .
marwan 's day began as usual .
he got into his car and started the engine .
but rather than driving off , his car blew up when the engine warmed up .
he died instantly .
marwan was a police officer .
i suppose that it is why he was targeted .
mourning events have replaced birthdays and wedding parties .
you are always surrounded by death .
the unwanted guest will visit you at any moment the tragedy did n't end there .
a few minutes later , his wife wafa shot herself when she realised her husband was dead .
the couple left behind a baby boy ahmad who is only 11 months old .
this was n't the only tragedy in wafa 's life .
two years ago , a shia militia , the mehdi army , assassinated her brother-in-law waheed .
four years ago , a rocket which was fired by sunni insurgents from devastated her family when it hit wafa 's aunt 's house .
wafa 's 12-year-old cousin mustafa was killed .
her mother , who was visiting the house , was paralysed and wafa 's six-year-old brother saad lost one eye .
tragedies like the one wafa experienced have become part of the life of most iraqis .
it is very unusual not to have a tragedy in the family .
mourning events have replaced birthdays and wedding parties .
you are always surrounded by death .
the unwanted guest will visit you at any moment .
you will see it on tv , you will hear it on the radio , and you 'll read about it in the newspapers .
even when you think that it is hundreds of miles away from you , it will touch you in some way .
why are you calling ?
as a journalist i have to gather information about bombings across iraq .
last week there was a large bomb near mosul , one of iraq 's main cities .
i have a book full of telephone numbers , which i was given by a former colleague who left the office .
other numbers i collected myself .
there was this number for a doctor in mosul that i tried to call .
i wanted to get information about the latest casualties .
a young woman answered the phone .
she was very curious as to why i was calling .
i think it is time to seriously consider going to that remote island i have always dreamed of " why are you calling , " she asked .
" where did you get this number from ?
how do you know this doctor ? "
her reaction was very unusual .
it took me a while to realise that this woman was the doctor 's daughter .
she started crying and said : " my father was assassinated two years ago in his clinic " .
i could hear in her voice the unspoken question : why he had been assassinated ?
i could feel that she 'd been asking the same question for two years .
i apologised and expressed my sympathy .
after i hung up i realised what i could have said to the doctor 's daughter .
" my poor young woman , your father died in vain just like marwan , mustafa , wafa and thousands and thousands of iraqis , " i could have said .
" we have become the firewood in a war which has no logic and victims of warriors who lack honour and nobility .
warriors we read about in history books at least had honour . "
i think it is time to seriously consider going to that remote island i have always dreamed of .
my iraq just before i finished writing these comments a police source called me to say that a man had got a court order to evict a bad tenant from an apartment he owns .
the tenant did not want to give the apartment back to the owner in a good condition , so instead he blew it up injuring two civilians .
this is my iraq .

for security reasons , the author 's name is not being published .
everyday family tragedy violent death in iraq is an everyday event .
in baghdad people put up signs on the street to announce deaths .
i am always surprised to read one which says that someone died of natural causes .
because it is so common , you get used to the number of violent deaths .
the problem is you just bury it deep inside you .
it becomes like a time bomb , you never know when it is going to explode .
all these feelings of fear , sadness and frustration burst out of me one morning last week when i lost marwan , a relative of mine .
marwan 's day began as usual .
he got into his car and started the engine .
but rather than driving off , his car blew up when the engine warmed up .
he died instantly .
marwan was a police officer .
i suppose that it is why he was targeted .
mourning events have replaced birthdays and wedding parties .
you are always surrounded by death .
the unwanted guest will visit you at any moment the tragedy did n't end there .
a few minutes later , his wife wafa shot herself when she realised her husband was dead .
the couple left behind a baby boy ahmad who is only 11 months old .
this was n't the only tragedy in wafa 's life .
two years ago , a shia militia , the mehdi army , assassinated her brother-in-law waheed .
four years ago , a rocket which was fired by sunni insurgents from devastated her family when it hit wafa 's aunt 's house .
wafa 's 12-year-old cousin mustafa was killed .
her mother , who was visiting the house , was paralysed and wafa 's six-year-old brother saad lost one eye .
tragedies like the one wafa experienced have become part of the life of most iraqis .
it is very unusual not to have a tragedy in the family .
mourning events have replaced birthdays and wedding parties .
you are always surrounded by death .
the unwanted guest will visit you at any moment .
you will see it on tv , you will hear it on the radio , and you 'll read about it in the newspapers .
even when you think that it is hundreds of miles away from you , it will touch you in some way .
why are you calling ?
as a journalist i have to gather information about bombings across iraq .
last week there was a large bomb near mosul , one of iraq 's main cities .
i have a book full of telephone numbers , which i was given by a former colleague who left the office .
other numbers i collected myself .
there was this number for a doctor in mosul that i tried to call .
i wanted to get information about the latest casualties .
a young woman answered the phone .
she was very curious as to why i was calling .
i think it is time to seriously consider going to that remote island i have always dreamed of " why are you calling , " she asked .
" where did you get this number from ?
how do you know this doctor ? "
her reaction was very unusual .
it took me a while to realise that this woman was the doctor 's daughter .
she started crying and said : " my father was assassinated two years ago in his clinic " .
i could hear in her voice the unspoken question : why he had been assassinated ?
i could feel that she 'd been asking the same question for two years .
i apologised and expressed my sympathy .
after i hung up i realised what i could have said to the doctor 's daughter .
" my poor young woman , your father died in vain just like marwan , mustafa , wafa and thousands and thousands of iraqis , " i could have said .
" we have become the firewood in a war which has no logic and victims of warriors who lack honour and nobility .
warriors we read about in history books at least had honour . "
i think it is time to seriously consider going to that remote island i have always dreamed of .
my iraq just before i finished writing these comments a police source called me to say that a man had got a court order to evict a bad tenant from an apartment he owns .
the tenant did not want to give the apartment back to the owner in a good condition , so instead he blew it up injuring two civilians .
this is my iraq .

for security reasons , the author 's name is not being published .
everyday family tragedy violent death in iraq is an everyday event .
in baghdad people put up signs on the street to announce deaths .
i am always surprised to read one which says that someone died of natural causes .
because it is so common , you get used to the number of violent deaths .
the problem is you just bury it deep inside you .
it becomes like a time bomb , you never know when it is going to explode .
all these feelings of fear , sadness and frustration burst out of me one morning last week when i lost marwan , a relative of mine .
marwan 's day began as usual .
he got into his car and started the engine .
but rather than driving off , his car blew up when the engine warmed up .
he died instantly .
marwan was a police officer .
i suppose that it is why he was targeted .
mourning events have replaced birthdays and wedding parties .
you are always surrounded by death .
the unwanted guest will visit you at any moment the tragedy did n't end there .
a few minutes later , his wife wafa shot herself when she realised her husband was dead .
the couple left behind a baby boy ahmad who is only 11 months old .
this was n't the only tragedy in wafa 's life .
two years ago , a shia militia , the mehdi army , assassinated her brother-in-law waheed .
four years ago , a rocket which was fired by sunni insurgents from devastated her family when it hit wafa 's aunt 's house .
wafa 's 12-year-old cousin mustafa was killed .
her mother , who was visiting the house , was paralysed and wafa 's six-year-old brother saad lost one eye .
tragedies like the one wafa experienced have become part of the life of most iraqis .
it is very unusual not to have a tragedy in the family .
mourning events have replaced birthdays and wedding parties .
you are always surrounded by death .
the unwanted guest will visit you at any moment .
you will see it on tv , you will hear it on the radio , and you 'll read about it in the newspapers .
even when you think that it is hundreds of miles away from you , it will touch you in some way .
why are you calling ?
as a journalist i have to gather information about bombings across iraq .
last week there was a large bomb near mosul , one of iraq 's main cities .
i have a book full of telephone numbers , which i was given by a former colleague who left the office .
other numbers i collected myself .
there was this number for a doctor in mosul that i tried to call .
i wanted to get information about the latest casualties .
a young woman answered the phone .
she was very curious as to why i was calling .
i think it is time to seriously consider going to that remote island i have always dreamed of " why are you calling , " she asked .
" where did you get this number from ?
how do you know this doctor ? "
her reaction was very unusual .
it took me a while to realise that this woman was the doctor 's daughter .
she started crying and said : " my father was assassinated two years ago in his clinic " .
i could hear in her voice the unspoken question : why he had been assassinated ?
i could feel that she 'd been asking the same question for two years .
i apologised and expressed my sympathy .
after i hung up i realised what i could have said to the doctor 's daughter .
" my poor young woman , your father died in vain just like marwan , mustafa , wafa and thousands and thousands of iraqis , " i could have said .
" we have become the firewood in a war which has no logic and victims of warriors who lack honour and nobility .
warriors we read about in history books at least had honour . "
i think it is time to seriously consider going to that remote island i have always dreamed of .
my iraq just before i finished writing these comments a police source called me to say that a man had got a court order to evict a bad tenant from an apartment he owns .
the tenant did not want to give the apartment back to the owner in a good condition , so instead he blew it up injuring two civilians .
this is my iraq .

the pair , aged 32 and 22 , are believed to be accused of handling items which were stolen from the couple .
they appeared before the chief magistrates in st john 's , on the caribbean island on thursday morning .
the newly-weds , both 31 and from pontardawe in the swansea valley , were shot in their hotel cottage on 27 july .
they were attacked at the cocos hotel and resort in the south west of the island in what police think was a robbery which went wrong on the last day of their honeymoon .
garry nelson , the commissioner of the antiguan police , said the charges were a " significant development " but that they were still looking for others in connection with the couple 's deaths .
the two women appeared before magistrates at st johns court in open court on thursday morning , which was very early in the morning local time .
this meant their case and appearance received very little attention at the time .
inspector cornelius charles , a spokesman for the antiguan police , said : " what happened , we had two ladies in police custody and they were charged today in connection relating to the mullany investigation and they have been remanded in custody .
" for strategic reasons we would not want to go into detail of the charges . "
he said releasing any further information could jeopardise the investigation .
" we expect to do some further arrests further down the road .
they were charged with some offences but were not charged with murder .
that is as much as i will want to say . "
he said british officers had been " working together " with police on the island and that the charges were " a significant development as far as the investigation is concerned " .
funeral service the couple were buried in a private ceremony on wednesday .
it is believed the burials took place at st john the evangelist church , in cilybebyll , pontardawe , where they married on july 12 .
their families said they were planning to hold a funeral service at a later date to allow extended family members , friends and colleagues to pay their respects .
catherine mullany , who was training to become a gp , was killed instantly after being shot in the head .
her husband , a university of the west of england physiotherapy student , died a week later after being airlifted to hospital in swansea in a critical condition .
death penalty more than 30 people have been questioned in connection with the shootings and a total of eight british officers have flown to antigua to assist with the investigation .
the island 's troubled 350-strong force , which is faced with rising violence , has no computers , no crime database and only one forensics-trained officer .
assistant commissioner ron scott , who was head of the force 's crime unit and one of four canadian police officers brought in earlier this year to transform antigua 's force , resigned at the weekend citing personal reasons .
antiguan justice minister collin derrick said the resignation would not affect the continuing murder investigations .
earlier this week , antigua 's government said it will introduce the death penalty for crimes involving weapons in the wake of the murders of the couple .
the new sentencing legislation will be introduced for anyone who uses a gun or knife in a crime which results in death or serious injury .
