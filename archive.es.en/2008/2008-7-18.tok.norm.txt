it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .
ahead of steinmeier 's visit he called it " unrealistic for now . " dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 18.07.2008 germany punishes first of liechtenstein tax dodgers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer a safe place to shelter millions ?
judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .
" you would need strong political pressure from the entire european union , " union president dieter ondracek told afp news agency .

" the remains belong to the homo erectus species , whereas modern humans are homo sapiens . karl-werner frangenberg , a fossil-hunter , found part of the skullcap in 2002 at a gravel pit at leinetal near hanover .
his wife , who shares the hobby , found part of the temple two years later . the fragments , now believed to be the oldest human remains ever found in germany , are on display in a hanover museum . previously germany 's oldest remains were of another species , homo heidelbergensis , found in 1907 and dated at 600,000 years old . czarnetzki admitted that dating the remains was inexact , but said he was convinced by the similarity to finds since 1891 on java . " it suggests the asian ones spread to europe , " he said , adding that his article on the find had been accepted by the journal of human evolution and would be published soon .

the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .

they spell trouble for the whole sector , he said . speaking thursday in washington , he called for higher standards in how banks and financial services firms manage their business risks .
he argued that the banking industry can not afford to be regulated only by market failures . the swiss native resorted to a familiar business to make his point . " if you are a chocolate manufacturer and your competitor goes out of business , maybe you are relieved , " ackermann said .
" not in banking . " nobody is too big to fail , he said , and banks are " too interconnected " to tolerate the collapse even of business rivals . " the problem of one bank , in an interconnected world , is a problem for many , " he said . ackermann spoke at the national press club in washington to promote a set of " best practices " issued thursday by the institute of international finance , which he chairs . new risk management strategy a report by the global association of 380 top banks and financial service companies found that responsibility for risk management should explicitly extend to bank chief executives .
it urged firms to evaluate their own risk exposure by more than one method , and that incentives for top executives should not encourage undue risk-taking . the report called for an external , independent review of rating agencies to re-establish market confidence in the system of bond ratings , which has been hit hard by the collapse of many formerly popular bonds that packaged large numbers of high-risk mortgages . ackermann announced that the iif would establish a market monitoring group to spot previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in the global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has not been immune from the financial crisis a year after the meltdown of the us mortgage market , the world 's largest economy is still struggling with the consequences .
just this month , a large consumer bank in california was taken over by us federal regulators . and in washington , the white house , congress and the rate-setting federal reserve board are engineering a rescue of a pair of government-chartered investment companies , nicknamed fannie mae and freddie mac .
the firms are used to raise private money from wall street to undergird the us mortgage market . the washington action was taken after bond investors showed strong signs of losing confidence in the battered lenders , who hold or guarantee $ 6 trillion in mortgages , some of which are now seen as dodgy investments . housing market taking questions from washington journalists , ackermann avoided being pinned down about when he saw the us housing market recovering from its two-year trough after a decade-long boom .
he noted that housing markets typically move in slower cycles than investments in more liquid assets , such as stocks and bonds . recent real-estate downturns in other regions have stretched for years . " in japan , it lasted 15 years , " ackermann said .
" in some european countries , it lasted five or six years . " for the broader us economy and the roiled global credit markets , he suggested a rebound " pretty soon . " national press club president sylvia smith , moderating questions from the audience , demanded a more specific answer , and ackermann pinned down " three to six months .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while dietrich got her big break as a cabaret singer in " the blue angel , " she became an international star after moving to hollywood in 1930 . dietrich 's credo , " i am , thank god , a berliner " is more than a homage to her birthplace , andre schmitz , secretary of state for culture , said . dietrich did n't shy away from politics while dietrich is one of berlin 's most famous daughters , the city has been slow to embrace her . sime germans saw dietrich as a traitor after world war ii .

berlin has a responsibility to " respect and preserve the legacy of a strong anti-fascist , engaged pacifist and emancipated , self-confident artist , " schmitz said at the commemoration of the new plaque on thursday , july 18 .
the lyrics of pete seeger 's anti-war songs , " where have all the flowers gone ? " which dietrich sang in german , are part of the memorial plaque .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 18.07.2008 europeans welcome us participation in iran nuclear talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians in germany protest against a nuclear-armed tehran european officials have hailed a decision by the us to send a senior envoy to weekend talks in geneva with iran aimed at resolving the dispute over tehran 's nuclear work . the decision by the united states to send william burns , the under secretary of state for politicial affairs , to nuclear talks with iran on saturday , july 19 , in geneva has has been welcomed by many as a shift in washington 's hard-line stance towards iran .
burns will join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and officials from britain , france , germany , russia and china for talks with iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saeid jalili is iran 's point man on nuclear negotiations " we are very pleased by the administration 's decision , " cristina gallach , solana 's spokeswoman , said in an interview with the new york times this week .
" it is a clear signal to the iranians of the engagement of the united states and its commitment to a negotiated solution .
at the same time , it is a clear message to the iranians of the seriousness of this exercise . "
world leaders are holding talks with iran to assess the response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt tehran 's covert uranium enrichment , which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons .
us involvement seen as a positive sign iran , too , has hailed the us ' participation in weekend talks .
" the american participation is positive , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference in damascus .
" we look forward to constructive engagement . "
france , who holds the current six-month rotating presidency of the european union , shared mottaki 's enthusiasm .
" the presence of an american is good news , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said this week .
" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .
but experts believe its engagement with iran is crucial in resolving the standoff since the us would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions .
last week , burns , who will attend the geneva talks , hinted that washington is considering opening a diplomatic mission in tehran for the first time in 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns hinted at further advances in us-iran relations opening a so-called interest section " is an interesting concept that is worth looking at carefully , " burns told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee .
us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .
" it 's too early to say whether there will be any progress , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner wants dialogue in tandem with sanctions " of course iran is a great country with a great history and culture , and tehran should take its legitimate place in the world , " he said .
" the result of paris ' talks with tehran has always been nil , " the french foreign minister added .
kouchner noted that the three sets of un security council sanctions had not managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment , which the west fears could be used to make the fissile material of nuclear bombs .
france and french oil giants had frozen their investment in iran and kouchner said he hoped all countries would do the same .
rice advocates diplomacy us secretary of state condoleezza rice injected some optimism into discussions by saying that the united states is " firmly behind " diplomatic efforts to halt iran 's sensitive nuclear work but did not know if tehran would respond positively .
" the point we are making is that the united states is firmly behind this diplomacy , " rice said after deciding to send burns to geneva to join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top negotiator on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us involvement was a message to iran " hopefully the iranians will take that message , " rice told reporters after meeting with alexander stubb , finland 's foreign minister .
asked if she expected the iranians to respond positively to a new incentives package to halt uranium enrichment work offered last month by the united states and five other international partners , she replied : " i do n't know .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .
ahead of steinmeier 's visit he called it " unrealistic for now . " dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 18.07.2008 scathing eu report exposes bulgaria 's high-level corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divisions between the eu and bulgaria have grown deeper since accession in 2007 in a withering indictment to be released next week , the european commission accuses bulgaria of high-level corruption and maladministration in the handling of eu funds .
the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .
this is work that is ongoing .
the document that i have seen circulated is not the latest draft .
the only report that matters is the one adopted on july 23 . "
problems exacerbated by organized crime and corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of bulgaria 's eu 's funding has gone unaccounted for the report , described by eu officials as the most scathing ever written about a member state , describes the endemic corruption which is undermining bulgarian efforts to fully integrate and efficiently operate within the eu : " high level corruption and organized crime exacerbates these problems of general weakness in administrative and judicial capacity .
" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .
bulgaria hires pr firms to polish image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption has tainted bulgaria 's eu membership in a bid to polish its image , bulgaria has taken the unusual step of hiring us and austrian public relations companies to handle the fallout from the accusations of organized crime and corruption .
according to data available from the website of the bulgarian public procurement agency , sofia signed a contract with austrian hochegger kommunikationsberatung for 1.87 million levs -lrb- $ 1.53 million -rrb- in taxpayers ' money last december for " a campaign for strengthening the positive image of bulgaria across the european union . "
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .
in an emailed statement to reuters , hochegger spokesman martin jenewein said : " hochegger 's assignment for the bulgarian government includes integrated communication services for the republic of bulgaria .
the scope of our consulting services is in communication enhancement and media relations . "
press visits to bulgaria organized and paid for by agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists have been flown in to interview pm stanishev the austrian agency is an associate of us-based pr consultancy burson-marsteller , which said it had done a small amount of work for the bulgarian government in brussels under the contract , mostly involving " outreach " to journalists .
robert mack , director of burson-marsteller in brussels , said that among those services was to arrange media appointments for rachel ehrenfeld , director of the new york-based american center for democracy , who has written articles saying bulgaria is being unfairly treated by the commission .
ehrenfeld visited bulgaria in may at the invitation of stanishev to conduct what she called " an independent study of bulgaria 's efforts to fight organized crime and corruption " , according to an article she wrote for the washington times .
" penalizing bulgaria will be counter-productive , " she concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burns will join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and officials from britain , france , germany , russia and china for talks with iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saeid jalili is iran 's point man on nuclear negotiations " we are very pleased by the administration 's decision , " cristina gallach , solana 's spokeswoman , said in an interview with the new york times this week .
" it is a clear signal to the iranians of the engagement of the united states and its commitment to a negotiated solution .
at the same time , it is a clear message to the iranians of the seriousness of this exercise . "
world leaders are holding talks with iran to assess the response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt tehran 's covert uranium enrichment , which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons .
us involvement seen as a positive sign iran , too , has hailed the us ' participation in weekend talks .
" the american participation is positive , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference in damascus .
" we look forward to constructive engagement . "
france , who holds the current six-month rotating presidency of the european union , shared mottaki 's enthusiasm .
" the presence of an american is good news , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said this week .
" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .
but experts believe its engagement with iran is crucial in resolving the standoff since the us would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions .
last week , burns , who will attend the geneva talks , hinted that washington is considering opening a diplomatic mission in tehran for the first time in 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns hinted at further advances in us-iran relations opening a so-called interest section " is an interesting concept that is worth looking at carefully , " burns told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee .
us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .
" it 's too early to say whether there will be any progress , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner wants dialogue in tandem with sanctions " of course iran is a great country with a great history and culture , and tehran should take its legitimate place in the world , " he said .
" the result of paris ' talks with tehran has always been nil , " the french foreign minister added .
kouchner noted that the three sets of un security council sanctions had not managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment , which the west fears could be used to make the fissile material of nuclear bombs .
france and french oil giants had frozen their investment in iran and kouchner said he hoped all countries would do the same .
rice advocates diplomacy us secretary of state condoleezza rice injected some optimism into discussions by saying that the united states is " firmly behind " diplomatic efforts to halt iran 's sensitive nuclear work but did not know if tehran would respond positively .
" the point we are making is that the united states is firmly behind this diplomacy , " rice said after deciding to send burns to geneva to join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top negotiator on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us involvement was a message to iran " hopefully the iranians will take that message , " rice told reporters after meeting with alexander stubb , finland 's foreign minister .
asked if she expected the iranians to respond positively to a new incentives package to halt uranium enrichment work offered last month by the united states and five other international partners , she replied : " i do n't know .

he also named three mediators with instructions to find a way out of the crisis : two french-speaking politicians , francois-xavier de donnea and raymond langendries , as well as karl-heinz lambertz from german-speaking belgium . albert urged the government to give full support to the reconciliation efforts . leterme heads a coalition that has tried to bridge the long-standing language rivalry between the 6.5 million dutch-speaking flemish people and the four million french-speaking walloons . both sides have been trying to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region has stirred particularly strong feelings . the formation in march of the leterme government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , had appeared to resolve a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns hinted at further advances in us-iran relations opening a so-called interest section " is an interesting concept that is worth looking at carefully , " burns told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee .
us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .
" it 's too early to say whether there will be any progress , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner wants dialogue in tandem with sanctions " of course iran is a great country with a great history and culture , and tehran should take its legitimate place in the world , " he said .
" the result of paris ' talks with tehran has always been nil , " the french foreign minister added .
kouchner noted that the three sets of un security council sanctions had not managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment , which the west fears could be used to make the fissile material of nuclear bombs .
france and french oil giants had frozen their investment in iran and kouchner said he hoped all countries would do the same .
rice advocates diplomacy us secretary of state condoleezza rice injected some optimism into discussions by saying that the united states is " firmly behind " diplomatic efforts to halt iran 's sensitive nuclear work but did not know if tehran would respond positively .
" the point we are making is that the united states is firmly behind this diplomacy , " rice said after deciding to send burns to geneva to join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top negotiator on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us involvement was a message to iran " hopefully the iranians will take that message , " rice told reporters after meeting with alexander stubb , finland 's foreign minister .
asked if she expected the iranians to respond positively to a new incentives package to halt uranium enrichment work offered last month by the united states and five other international partners , she replied : " i do n't know .

he also named three mediators with instructions to find a way out of the crisis : two french-speaking politicians , francois-xavier de donnea and raymond langendries , as well as karl-heinz lambertz from german-speaking belgium . albert urged the government to give full support to the reconciliation efforts . leterme heads a coalition that has tried to bridge the long-standing language rivalry between the 6.5 million dutch-speaking flemish people and the four million french-speaking walloons . both sides have been trying to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region has stirred particularly strong feelings . the formation in march of the leterme government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , had appeared to resolve a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .

" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .

he also named three mediators with instructions to find a way out of the crisis : two french-speaking politicians , francois-xavier de donnea and raymond langendries , as well as karl-heinz lambertz from german-speaking belgium . albert urged the government to give full support to the reconciliation efforts . leterme heads a coalition that has tried to bridge the long-standing language rivalry between the 6.5 million dutch-speaking flemish people and the four million french-speaking walloons . both sides have been trying to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region has stirred particularly strong feelings . the formation in march of the leterme government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , had appeared to resolve a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 18.07.2008 germany punishes first of liechtenstein tax dodgers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer a safe place to shelter millions ?
judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .
" you would need strong political pressure from the entire european union , " union president dieter ondracek told afp news agency .

the late actress is one of berlin 's most famous daughters . the daughter of a police lieutenant father and a mother from a well-to-do clock-making family , dietrich was born on december 27 , 1901 in an apartment of a house on leberstrasse 65 in the berlin-schoeneberg neighborhood .
while dietrich got her big break as a cabaret singer in " the blue angel , " she became an international star after moving to hollywood in 1930 . dietrich 's credo , " i am , thank god , a berliner " is more than a homage to her birthplace , andre schmitz , secretary of state for culture , said . dietrich did n't shy away from politics while dietrich is one of berlin 's most famous daughters , the city has been slow to embrace her . sime germans saw dietrich as a traitor after world war ii .
dietrich became a us citizen in 1937 .
during world war ii she did musical performances for us troops and was an outspoken critic of the nazi regime .
berlin has a responsibility to " respect and preserve the legacy of a strong anti-fascist , engaged pacifist and emancipated , self-confident artist , " schmitz said at the commemoration of the new plaque on thursday , july 18 .
the lyrics of pete seeger 's anti-war songs , " where have all the flowers gone ? " which dietrich sang in german , are part of the memorial plaque .

the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .
the stage has few difficulties and is likely to end in a mass sprint in which young british shooting star mark cavendish , who has proved himself to be by far the fastest finisher , will be looking for his fourth stage victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the late actress is one of berlin 's most famous daughters . the daughter of a police lieutenant father and a mother from a well-to-do clock-making family , dietrich was born on december 27 , 1901 in an apartment of a house on leberstrasse 65 in the berlin-schoeneberg neighborhood .
while dietrich got her big break as a cabaret singer in " the blue angel , " she became an international star after moving to hollywood in 1930 . dietrich 's credo , " i am , thank god , a berliner " is more than a homage to her birthplace , andre schmitz , secretary of state for culture , said . dietrich did n't shy away from politics while dietrich is one of berlin 's most famous daughters , the city has been slow to embrace her . sime germans saw dietrich as a traitor after world war ii .
dietrich became a us citizen in 1937 .
during world war ii she did musical performances for us troops and was an outspoken critic of the nazi regime .
berlin has a responsibility to " respect and preserve the legacy of a strong anti-fascist , engaged pacifist and emancipated , self-confident artist , " schmitz said at the commemoration of the new plaque on thursday , july 18 .
the lyrics of pete seeger 's anti-war songs , " where have all the flowers gone ? " which dietrich sang in german , are part of the memorial plaque .
dietrich died on may 6 , 1992 at the age of 90 in her paris apartment .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 18.07.2008 scathing eu report exposes bulgaria 's high-level corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divisions between the eu and bulgaria have grown deeper since accession in 2007 in a withering indictment to be released next week , the european commission accuses bulgaria of high-level corruption and maladministration in the handling of eu funds .
the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .
this is work that is ongoing .
the document that i have seen circulated is not the latest draft .
the only report that matters is the one adopted on july 23 . "
problems exacerbated by organized crime and corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of bulgaria 's eu 's funding has gone unaccounted for the report , described by eu officials as the most scathing ever written about a member state , describes the endemic corruption which is undermining bulgarian efforts to fully integrate and efficiently operate within the eu : " high level corruption and organized crime exacerbates these problems of general weakness in administrative and judicial capacity .
" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .
bulgaria hires pr firms to polish image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption has tainted bulgaria 's eu membership in a bid to polish its image , bulgaria has taken the unusual step of hiring us and austrian public relations companies to handle the fallout from the accusations of organized crime and corruption .
according to data available from the website of the bulgarian public procurement agency , sofia signed a contract with austrian hochegger kommunikationsberatung for 1.87 million levs -lrb- $ 1.53 million -rrb- in taxpayers ' money last december for " a campaign for strengthening the positive image of bulgaria across the european union . "
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .
in an emailed statement to reuters , hochegger spokesman martin jenewein said : " hochegger 's assignment for the bulgarian government includes integrated communication services for the republic of bulgaria .
the scope of our consulting services is in communication enhancement and media relations . "
press visits to bulgaria organized and paid for by agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists have been flown in to interview pm stanishev the austrian agency is an associate of us-based pr consultancy burson-marsteller , which said it had done a small amount of work for the bulgarian government in brussels under the contract , mostly involving " outreach " to journalists .
robert mack , director of burson-marsteller in brussels , said that among those services was to arrange media appointments for rachel ehrenfeld , director of the new york-based american center for democracy , who has written articles saying bulgaria is being unfairly treated by the commission .
ehrenfeld visited bulgaria in may at the invitation of stanishev to conduct what she called " an independent study of bulgaria 's efforts to fight organized crime and corruption " , according to an article she wrote for the washington times .
" penalizing bulgaria will be counter-productive , " she concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burns will join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and officials from britain , france , germany , russia and china for talks with iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saeid jalili is iran 's point man on nuclear negotiations " we are very pleased by the administration 's decision , " cristina gallach , solana 's spokeswoman , said in an interview with the new york times this week .
" it is a clear signal to the iranians of the engagement of the united states and its commitment to a negotiated solution .
at the same time , it is a clear message to the iranians of the seriousness of this exercise . "
world leaders are holding talks with iran to assess the response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt tehran 's covert uranium enrichment , which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons .
us involvement seen as a positive sign iran , too , has hailed the us ' participation in weekend talks .
" the american participation is positive , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference in damascus .
" we look forward to constructive engagement . "
france , who holds the current six-month rotating presidency of the european union , shared mottaki 's enthusiasm .
" the presence of an american is good news , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said this week .
" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .
but experts believe its engagement with iran is crucial in resolving the standoff since the us would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions .
last week , burns , who will attend the geneva talks , hinted that washington is considering opening a diplomatic mission in tehran for the first time in 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns hinted at further advances in us-iran relations opening a so-called interest section " is an interesting concept that is worth looking at carefully , " burns told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee .
us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .
" it 's too early to say whether there will be any progress , " he added .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .

the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .

the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

they spell trouble for the whole sector , he said . speaking thursday in washington , he called for higher standards in how banks and financial services firms manage their business risks .
he argued that the banking industry can not afford to be regulated only by market failures . the swiss native resorted to a familiar business to make his point . " if you are a chocolate manufacturer and your competitor goes out of business , maybe you are relieved , " ackermann said .
" not in banking . " nobody is too big to fail , he said , and banks are " too interconnected " to tolerate the collapse even of business rivals . " the problem of one bank , in an interconnected world , is a problem for many , " he said . ackermann spoke at the national press club in washington to promote a set of " best practices " issued thursday by the institute of international finance , which he chairs . new risk management strategy a report by the global association of 380 top banks and financial service companies found that responsibility for risk management should explicitly extend to bank chief executives .
it urged firms to evaluate their own risk exposure by more than one method , and that incentives for top executives should not encourage undue risk-taking . the report called for an external , independent review of rating agencies to re-establish market confidence in the system of bond ratings , which has been hit hard by the collapse of many formerly popular bonds that packaged large numbers of high-risk mortgages . ackermann announced that the iif would establish a market monitoring group to spot previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in the global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has not been immune from the financial crisis a year after the meltdown of the us mortgage market , the world 's largest economy is still struggling with the consequences .
just this month , a large consumer bank in california was taken over by us federal regulators . and in washington , the white house , congress and the rate-setting federal reserve board are engineering a rescue of a pair of government-chartered investment companies , nicknamed fannie mae and freddie mac .
the firms are used to raise private money from wall street to undergird the us mortgage market . the washington action was taken after bond investors showed strong signs of losing confidence in the battered lenders , who hold or guarantee $ 6 trillion in mortgages , some of which are now seen as dodgy investments . housing market taking questions from washington journalists , ackermann avoided being pinned down about when he saw the us housing market recovering from its two-year trough after a decade-long boom .
he noted that housing markets typically move in slower cycles than investments in more liquid assets , such as stocks and bonds . recent real-estate downturns in other regions have stretched for years . " in japan , it lasted 15 years , " ackermann said .
" in some european countries , it lasted five or six years . " for the broader us economy and the roiled global credit markets , he suggested a rebound " pretty soon . " national press club president sylvia smith , moderating questions from the audience , demanded a more specific answer , and ackermann pinned down " three to six months . " " my strong conviction , " ackermann said , " is we are seeing the beginning of the end of the financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 18.07.2008 russia calls german peace plan for caucasus " helpful " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazhia 's separatists are n't as open to the german peace plan as russia russian foreign minister lavrov downplayed earlier criticism of a german peace plan aimed at resolving a conflict with georgia , saying it could break the deadlock .
abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 18.07.2008 tainted tour continues without fallen star ricco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricco was led away by french gendarmes prior to the start of the 12th stage of the tour the 13th stage of the tour de france got underway friday , july 18 in the city of narbonne with one of cycling 's young stars , riccardo ricco , sitting in jail after testing positive for a cutting-edge variant of epo . ricco was expected to be placed under investigation later friday in the city of mirepoix , where he spent the night behind bars because tests taken after the fourth stage of the race , on july 8 , detected the presence of cera -lrb- continuous erythropietin receptor activator -rrb- , a cutting-edge variant of the blood-boosting hormone epo , in his urine .
the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .
the stage has few difficulties and is likely to end in a mass sprint in which young british shooting star mark cavendish , who has proved himself to be by far the fastest finisher , will be looking for his fourth stage victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they spell trouble for the whole sector , he said . speaking thursday in washington , he called for higher standards in how banks and financial services firms manage their business risks .
he argued that the banking industry can not afford to be regulated only by market failures . the swiss native resorted to a familiar business to make his point . " if you are a chocolate manufacturer and your competitor goes out of business , maybe you are relieved , " ackermann said .
" not in banking . " nobody is too big to fail , he said , and banks are " too interconnected " to tolerate the collapse even of business rivals . " the problem of one bank , in an interconnected world , is a problem for many , " he said . ackermann spoke at the national press club in washington to promote a set of " best practices " issued thursday by the institute of international finance , which he chairs . new risk management strategy a report by the global association of 380 top banks and financial service companies found that responsibility for risk management should explicitly extend to bank chief executives .
it urged firms to evaluate their own risk exposure by more than one method , and that incentives for top executives should not encourage undue risk-taking . the report called for an external , independent review of rating agencies to re-establish market confidence in the system of bond ratings , which has been hit hard by the collapse of many formerly popular bonds that packaged large numbers of high-risk mortgages . ackermann announced that the iif would establish a market monitoring group to spot previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in the global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has not been immune from the financial crisis a year after the meltdown of the us mortgage market , the world 's largest economy is still struggling with the consequences .
just this month , a large consumer bank in california was taken over by us federal regulators . and in washington , the white house , congress and the rate-setting federal reserve board are engineering a rescue of a pair of government-chartered investment companies , nicknamed fannie mae and freddie mac .
the firms are used to raise private money from wall street to undergird the us mortgage market . the washington action was taken after bond investors showed strong signs of losing confidence in the battered lenders , who hold or guarantee $ 6 trillion in mortgages , some of which are now seen as dodgy investments . housing market taking questions from washington journalists , ackermann avoided being pinned down about when he saw the us housing market recovering from its two-year trough after a decade-long boom .
he noted that housing markets typically move in slower cycles than investments in more liquid assets , such as stocks and bonds . recent real-estate downturns in other regions have stretched for years . " in japan , it lasted 15 years , " ackermann said .
" in some european countries , it lasted five or six years . " for the broader us economy and the roiled global credit markets , he suggested a rebound " pretty soon . " national press club president sylvia smith , moderating questions from the audience , demanded a more specific answer , and ackermann pinned down " three to six months . " " my strong conviction , " ackermann said , " is we are seeing the beginning of the end of the financial crisis .

the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .
the stage has few difficulties and is likely to end in a mass sprint in which young british shooting star mark cavendish , who has proved himself to be by far the fastest finisher , will be looking for his fourth stage victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burns will join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and officials from britain , france , germany , russia and china for talks with iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saeid jalili is iran 's point man on nuclear negotiations " we are very pleased by the administration 's decision , " cristina gallach , solana 's spokeswoman , said in an interview with the new york times this week .
" it is a clear signal to the iranians of the engagement of the united states and its commitment to a negotiated solution .
at the same time , it is a clear message to the iranians of the seriousness of this exercise . "
world leaders are holding talks with iran to assess the response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt tehran 's covert uranium enrichment , which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons .
us involvement seen as a positive sign iran , too , has hailed the us ' participation in weekend talks .
" the american participation is positive , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference in damascus .
" we look forward to constructive engagement . "
france , who holds the current six-month rotating presidency of the european union , shared mottaki 's enthusiasm .
" the presence of an american is good news , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said this week .
" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .
but experts believe its engagement with iran is crucial in resolving the standoff since the us would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions .
last week , burns , who will attend the geneva talks , hinted that washington is considering opening a diplomatic mission in tehran for the first time in 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns hinted at further advances in us-iran relations opening a so-called interest section " is an interesting concept that is worth looking at carefully , " burns told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee .
us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .
" it 's too early to say whether there will be any progress , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner wants dialogue in tandem with sanctions " of course iran is a great country with a great history and culture , and tehran should take its legitimate place in the world , " he said .
" the result of paris ' talks with tehran has always been nil , " the french foreign minister added .
kouchner noted that the three sets of un security council sanctions had not managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment , which the west fears could be used to make the fissile material of nuclear bombs .
france and french oil giants had frozen their investment in iran and kouchner said he hoped all countries would do the same .
rice advocates diplomacy us secretary of state condoleezza rice injected some optimism into discussions by saying that the united states is " firmly behind " diplomatic efforts to halt iran 's sensitive nuclear work but did not know if tehran would respond positively .

burns will join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and officials from britain , france , germany , russia and china for talks with iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saeid jalili is iran 's point man on nuclear negotiations " we are very pleased by the administration 's decision , " cristina gallach , solana 's spokeswoman , said in an interview with the new york times this week .
" it is a clear signal to the iranians of the engagement of the united states and its commitment to a negotiated solution .
at the same time , it is a clear message to the iranians of the seriousness of this exercise . "
world leaders are holding talks with iran to assess the response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt tehran 's covert uranium enrichment , which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons .
us involvement seen as a positive sign iran , too , has hailed the us ' participation in weekend talks .
" the american participation is positive , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference in damascus .
" we look forward to constructive engagement . "
france , who holds the current six-month rotating presidency of the european union , shared mottaki 's enthusiasm .
" the presence of an american is good news , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said this week .
" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .
but experts believe its engagement with iran is crucial in resolving the standoff since the us would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions .
last week , burns , who will attend the geneva talks , hinted that washington is considering opening a diplomatic mission in tehran for the first time in 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns hinted at further advances in us-iran relations opening a so-called interest section " is an interesting concept that is worth looking at carefully , " burns told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee .
us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .
" it 's too early to say whether there will be any progress , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner wants dialogue in tandem with sanctions " of course iran is a great country with a great history and culture , and tehran should take its legitimate place in the world , " he said .
" the result of paris ' talks with tehran has always been nil , " the french foreign minister added .
kouchner noted that the three sets of un security council sanctions had not managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment , which the west fears could be used to make the fissile material of nuclear bombs .
france and french oil giants had frozen their investment in iran and kouchner said he hoped all countries would do the same .
rice advocates diplomacy us secretary of state condoleezza rice injected some optimism into discussions by saying that the united states is " firmly behind " diplomatic efforts to halt iran 's sensitive nuclear work but did not know if tehran would respond positively .
" the point we are making is that the united states is firmly behind this diplomacy , " rice said after deciding to send burns to geneva to join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top negotiator on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us involvement was a message to iran " hopefully the iranians will take that message , " rice told reporters after meeting with alexander stubb , finland 's foreign minister .

the late actress is one of berlin 's most famous daughters . the daughter of a police lieutenant father and a mother from a well-to-do clock-making family , dietrich was born on december 27 , 1901 in an apartment of a house on leberstrasse 65 in the berlin-schoeneberg neighborhood .
while dietrich got her big break as a cabaret singer in " the blue angel , " she became an international star after moving to hollywood in 1930 . dietrich 's credo , " i am , thank god , a berliner " is more than a homage to her birthplace , andre schmitz , secretary of state for culture , said . dietrich did n't shy away from politics while dietrich is one of berlin 's most famous daughters , the city has been slow to embrace her . sime germans saw dietrich as a traitor after world war ii .
dietrich became a us citizen in 1937 .
during world war ii she did musical performances for us troops and was an outspoken critic of the nazi regime .
berlin has a responsibility to " respect and preserve the legacy of a strong anti-fascist , engaged pacifist and emancipated , self-confident artist , " schmitz said at the commemoration of the new plaque on thursday , july 18 .
the lyrics of pete seeger 's anti-war songs , " where have all the flowers gone ? " which dietrich sang in german , are part of the memorial plaque .
dietrich died on may 6 , 1992 at the age of 90 in her paris apartment .
she was buried in a cemetery in berlin-schoeneberg . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .

those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .

the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .

" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .

the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .

" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .

"
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .
in an emailed statement to reuters , hochegger spokesman martin jenewein said : " hochegger 's assignment for the bulgarian government includes integrated communication services for the republic of bulgaria .

he also named three mediators with instructions to find a way out of the crisis : two french-speaking politicians , francois-xavier de donnea and raymond langendries , as well as karl-heinz lambertz from german-speaking belgium . albert urged the government to give full support to the reconciliation efforts . leterme heads a coalition that has tried to bridge the long-standing language rivalry between the 6.5 million dutch-speaking flemish people and the four million french-speaking walloons . both sides have been trying to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .

it urged firms to evaluate their own risk exposure by more than one method , and that incentives for top executives should not encourage undue risk-taking . the report called for an external , independent review of rating agencies to re-establish market confidence in the system of bond ratings , which has been hit hard by the collapse of many formerly popular bonds that packaged large numbers of high-risk mortgages . ackermann announced that the iif would establish a market monitoring group to spot previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in the global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has not been immune from the financial crisis a year after the meltdown of the us mortgage market , the world 's largest economy is still struggling with the consequences .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .

burns will join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and officials from britain , france , germany , russia and china for talks with iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saeid jalili is iran 's point man on nuclear negotiations " we are very pleased by the administration 's decision , " cristina gallach , solana 's spokeswoman , said in an interview with the new york times this week .

at the same time , it is a clear message to the iranians of the seriousness of this exercise . "
world leaders are holding talks with iran to assess the response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt tehran 's covert uranium enrichment , which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons .
us involvement seen as a positive sign iran , too , has hailed the us ' participation in weekend talks .
" the american participation is positive , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference in damascus .
" we look forward to constructive engagement . "
france , who holds the current six-month rotating presidency of the european union , shared mottaki 's enthusiasm .
" the presence of an american is good news , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said this week .
" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .
but experts believe its engagement with iran is crucial in resolving the standoff since the us would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions .
last week , burns , who will attend the geneva talks , hinted that washington is considering opening a diplomatic mission in tehran for the first time in 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns hinted at further advances in us-iran relations opening a so-called interest section " is an interesting concept that is worth looking at carefully , " burns told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee .
us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .
" it 's too early to say whether there will be any progress , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner wants dialogue in tandem with sanctions " of course iran is a great country with a great history and culture , and tehran should take its legitimate place in the world , " he said .
" the result of paris ' talks with tehran has always been nil , " the french foreign minister added .
kouchner noted that the three sets of un security council sanctions had not managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment , which the west fears could be used to make the fissile material of nuclear bombs .
france and french oil giants had frozen their investment in iran and kouchner said he hoped all countries would do the same .
rice advocates diplomacy us secretary of state condoleezza rice injected some optimism into discussions by saying that the united states is " firmly behind " diplomatic efforts to halt iran 's sensitive nuclear work but did not know if tehran would respond positively .
" the point we are making is that the united states is firmly behind this diplomacy , " rice said after deciding to send burns to geneva to join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top negotiator on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us involvement was a message to iran " hopefully the iranians will take that message , " rice told reporters after meeting with alexander stubb , finland 's foreign minister .

un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .
" you would need strong political pressure from the entire european union , " union president dieter ondracek told afp news agency .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .

the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .

saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .

" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 18.07.2008 scathing eu report exposes bulgaria 's high-level corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divisions between the eu and bulgaria have grown deeper since accession in 2007 in a withering indictment to be released next week , the european commission accuses bulgaria of high-level corruption and maladministration in the handling of eu funds .
the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .
this is work that is ongoing .
the document that i have seen circulated is not the latest draft .
the only report that matters is the one adopted on july 23 . "
problems exacerbated by organized crime and corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of bulgaria 's eu 's funding has gone unaccounted for the report , described by eu officials as the most scathing ever written about a member state , describes the endemic corruption which is undermining bulgarian efforts to fully integrate and efficiently operate within the eu : " high level corruption and organized crime exacerbates these problems of general weakness in administrative and judicial capacity .
" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .
bulgaria hires pr firms to polish image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption has tainted bulgaria 's eu membership in a bid to polish its image , bulgaria has taken the unusual step of hiring us and austrian public relations companies to handle the fallout from the accusations of organized crime and corruption .
according to data available from the website of the bulgarian public procurement agency , sofia signed a contract with austrian hochegger kommunikationsberatung for 1.87 million levs -lrb- $ 1.53 million -rrb- in taxpayers ' money last december for " a campaign for strengthening the positive image of bulgaria across the european union . "
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .
in an emailed statement to reuters , hochegger spokesman martin jenewein said : " hochegger 's assignment for the bulgarian government includes integrated communication services for the republic of bulgaria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 18.07.2008 scathing eu report exposes bulgaria 's high-level corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divisions between the eu and bulgaria have grown deeper since accession in 2007 in a withering indictment to be released next week , the european commission accuses bulgaria of high-level corruption and maladministration in the handling of eu funds .
the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .
this is work that is ongoing .
the document that i have seen circulated is not the latest draft .
the only report that matters is the one adopted on july 23 . "
problems exacerbated by organized crime and corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of bulgaria 's eu 's funding has gone unaccounted for the report , described by eu officials as the most scathing ever written about a member state , describes the endemic corruption which is undermining bulgarian efforts to fully integrate and efficiently operate within the eu : " high level corruption and organized crime exacerbates these problems of general weakness in administrative and judicial capacity .
" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .
bulgaria hires pr firms to polish image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption has tainted bulgaria 's eu membership in a bid to polish its image , bulgaria has taken the unusual step of hiring us and austrian public relations companies to handle the fallout from the accusations of organized crime and corruption .
according to data available from the website of the bulgarian public procurement agency , sofia signed a contract with austrian hochegger kommunikationsberatung for 1.87 million levs -lrb- $ 1.53 million -rrb- in taxpayers ' money last december for " a campaign for strengthening the positive image of bulgaria across the european union . "
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .
in an emailed statement to reuters , hochegger spokesman martin jenewein said : " hochegger 's assignment for the bulgarian government includes integrated communication services for the republic of bulgaria .
the scope of our consulting services is in communication enhancement and media relations . "
press visits to bulgaria organized and paid for by agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists have been flown in to interview pm stanishev the austrian agency is an associate of us-based pr consultancy burson-marsteller , which said it had done a small amount of work for the bulgarian government in brussels under the contract , mostly involving " outreach " to journalists .
robert mack , director of burson-marsteller in brussels , said that among those services was to arrange media appointments for rachel ehrenfeld , director of the new york-based american center for democracy , who has written articles saying bulgaria is being unfairly treated by the commission .
ehrenfeld visited bulgaria in may at the invitation of stanishev to conduct what she called " an independent study of bulgaria 's efforts to fight organized crime and corruption " , according to an article she wrote for the washington times .
" penalizing bulgaria will be counter-productive , " she concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .

the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .
ahead of steinmeier 's visit he called it " unrealistic for now . " dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

koehler expressed his admiration for mandela in an article for the frankfurter rundschau newspaper 's friday edition .
mandela spent 27 years in prison for trying to overthrow the white-only apartheid regime in south africa .
after being elected president in 1994 , he promoted peace and multi-racial democracy .
reconcilliation was n't just a word for the man who established south africa 's truth and reconciliation comission , koehler wrote .
mandela 's commission remains the gold standard " for the political embodiment of reconciliation in the world , " koehler said .
mandela remains an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandela will celebrate with his family koehler said that mandela , who only served one term as president , sets an example for zimbabwe , where robert mugabe has refused to release his grip on power .
mandela completely retired from public life four years ago .
he continues to be involved with his charity foundation , which raises money for aids patients and underprivileged children .
while mandela plans a low-key family celebration on friday , tributes have been pouring in from around south africa and the world .

the late actress is one of berlin 's most famous daughters . the daughter of a police lieutenant father and a mother from a well-to-do clock-making family , dietrich was born on december 27 , 1901 in an apartment of a house on leberstrasse 65 in the berlin-schoeneberg neighborhood .
while dietrich got her big break as a cabaret singer in " the blue angel , " she became an international star after moving to hollywood in 1930 . dietrich 's credo , " i am , thank god , a berliner " is more than a homage to her birthplace , andre schmitz , secretary of state for culture , said . dietrich did n't shy away from politics while dietrich is one of berlin 's most famous daughters , the city has been slow to embrace her . sime germans saw dietrich as a traitor after world war ii .
dietrich became a us citizen in 1937 .
during world war ii she did musical performances for us troops and was an outspoken critic of the nazi regime .
berlin has a responsibility to " respect and preserve the legacy of a strong anti-fascist , engaged pacifist and emancipated , self-confident artist , " schmitz said at the commemoration of the new plaque on thursday , july 18 .
the lyrics of pete seeger 's anti-war songs , " where have all the flowers gone ? " which dietrich sang in german , are part of the memorial plaque .
dietrich died on may 6 , 1992 at the age of 90 in her paris apartment .
she was buried in a cemetery in berlin-schoeneberg . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also named three mediators with instructions to find a way out of the crisis : two french-speaking politicians , francois-xavier de donnea and raymond langendries , as well as karl-heinz lambertz from german-speaking belgium . albert urged the government to give full support to the reconciliation efforts . leterme heads a coalition that has tried to bridge the long-standing language rivalry between the 6.5 million dutch-speaking flemish people and the four million french-speaking walloons . both sides have been trying to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region has stirred particularly strong feelings . the formation in march of the leterme government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , had appeared to resolve a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .
ahead of steinmeier 's visit he called it " unrealistic for now . " dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .
ahead of steinmeier 's visit he called it " unrealistic for now . " dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 18.07.2008 germany punishes first of liechtenstein tax dodgers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer a safe place to shelter millions ?
judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .
" you would need strong political pressure from the entire european union , " union president dieter ondracek told afp news agency .

they spell trouble for the whole sector , he said . speaking thursday in washington , he called for higher standards in how banks and financial services firms manage their business risks .
he argued that the banking industry can not afford to be regulated only by market failures . the swiss native resorted to a familiar business to make his point . " if you are a chocolate manufacturer and your competitor goes out of business , maybe you are relieved , " ackermann said .
" not in banking . " nobody is too big to fail , he said , and banks are " too interconnected " to tolerate the collapse even of business rivals . " the problem of one bank , in an interconnected world , is a problem for many , " he said . ackermann spoke at the national press club in washington to promote a set of " best practices " issued thursday by the institute of international finance , which he chairs . new risk management strategy a report by the global association of 380 top banks and financial service companies found that responsibility for risk management should explicitly extend to bank chief executives .
it urged firms to evaluate their own risk exposure by more than one method , and that incentives for top executives should not encourage undue risk-taking . the report called for an external , independent review of rating agencies to re-establish market confidence in the system of bond ratings , which has been hit hard by the collapse of many formerly popular bonds that packaged large numbers of high-risk mortgages . ackermann announced that the iif would establish a market monitoring group to spot previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in the global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has not been immune from the financial crisis a year after the meltdown of the us mortgage market , the world 's largest economy is still struggling with the consequences .
just this month , a large consumer bank in california was taken over by us federal regulators . and in washington , the white house , congress and the rate-setting federal reserve board are engineering a rescue of a pair of government-chartered investment companies , nicknamed fannie mae and freddie mac .
the firms are used to raise private money from wall street to undergird the us mortgage market . the washington action was taken after bond investors showed strong signs of losing confidence in the battered lenders , who hold or guarantee $ 6 trillion in mortgages , some of which are now seen as dodgy investments . housing market taking questions from washington journalists , ackermann avoided being pinned down about when he saw the us housing market recovering from its two-year trough after a decade-long boom .
he noted that housing markets typically move in slower cycles than investments in more liquid assets , such as stocks and bonds . recent real-estate downturns in other regions have stretched for years . " in japan , it lasted 15 years , " ackermann said .
" in some european countries , it lasted five or six years . " for the broader us economy and the roiled global credit markets , he suggested a rebound " pretty soon . " national press club president sylvia smith , moderating questions from the audience , demanded a more specific answer , and ackermann pinned down " three to six months .

his wife , who shares the hobby , found part of the temple two years later . the fragments , now believed to be the oldest human remains ever found in germany , are on display in a hanover museum . previously germany 's oldest remains were of another species , homo heidelbergensis , found in 1907 and dated at 600,000 years old . czarnetzki admitted that dating the remains was inexact , but said he was convinced by the similarity to finds since 1891 on java . " it suggests the asian ones spread to europe , " he said , adding that his article on the find had been accepted by the journal of human evolution and would be published soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 18.07.2008 tainted tour continues without fallen star ricco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricco was led away by french gendarmes prior to the start of the 12th stage of the tour the 13th stage of the tour de france got underway friday , july 18 in the city of narbonne with one of cycling 's young stars , riccardo ricco , sitting in jail after testing positive for a cutting-edge variant of epo . ricco was expected to be placed under investigation later friday in the city of mirepoix , where he spent the night behind bars because tests taken after the fourth stage of the race , on july 8 , detected the presence of cera -lrb- continuous erythropietin receptor activator -rrb- , a cutting-edge variant of the blood-boosting hormone epo , in his urine .
the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .
the stage has few difficulties and is likely to end in a mass sprint in which young british shooting star mark cavendish , who has proved himself to be by far the fastest finisher , will be looking for his fourth stage victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .
ahead of steinmeier 's visit he called it " unrealistic for now . " dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 18.07.2008 tainted tour continues without fallen star ricco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricco was led away by french gendarmes prior to the start of the 12th stage of the tour the 13th stage of the tour de france got underway friday , july 18 in the city of narbonne with one of cycling 's young stars , riccardo ricco , sitting in jail after testing positive for a cutting-edge variant of epo . ricco was expected to be placed under investigation later friday in the city of mirepoix , where he spent the night behind bars because tests taken after the fourth stage of the race , on july 8 , detected the presence of cera -lrb- continuous erythropietin receptor activator -rrb- , a cutting-edge variant of the blood-boosting hormone epo , in his urine .
the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .
the stage has few difficulties and is likely to end in a mass sprint in which young british shooting star mark cavendish , who has proved himself to be by far the fastest finisher , will be looking for his fourth stage victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the late actress is one of berlin 's most famous daughters . the daughter of a police lieutenant father and a mother from a well-to-do clock-making family , dietrich was born on december 27 , 1901 in an apartment of a house on leberstrasse 65 in the berlin-schoeneberg neighborhood .
while dietrich got her big break as a cabaret singer in " the blue angel , " she became an international star after moving to hollywood in 1930 . dietrich 's credo , " i am , thank god , a berliner " is more than a homage to her birthplace , andre schmitz , secretary of state for culture , said . dietrich did n't shy away from politics while dietrich is one of berlin 's most famous daughters , the city has been slow to embrace her . sime germans saw dietrich as a traitor after world war ii .
dietrich became a us citizen in 1937 .
during world war ii she did musical performances for us troops and was an outspoken critic of the nazi regime .
berlin has a responsibility to " respect and preserve the legacy of a strong anti-fascist , engaged pacifist and emancipated , self-confident artist , " schmitz said at the commemoration of the new plaque on thursday , july 18 .
the lyrics of pete seeger 's anti-war songs , " where have all the flowers gone ? " which dietrich sang in german , are part of the memorial plaque .
dietrich died on may 6 , 1992 at the age of 90 in her paris apartment .
she was buried in a cemetery in berlin-schoeneberg . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the remains belong to the homo erectus species , whereas modern humans are homo sapiens . karl-werner frangenberg , a fossil-hunter , found part of the skullcap in 2002 at a gravel pit at leinetal near hanover .
his wife , who shares the hobby , found part of the temple two years later . the fragments , now believed to be the oldest human remains ever found in germany , are on display in a hanover museum . previously germany 's oldest remains were of another species , homo heidelbergensis , found in 1907 and dated at 600,000 years old . czarnetzki admitted that dating the remains was inexact , but said he was convinced by the similarity to finds since 1891 on java . " it suggests the asian ones spread to europe , " he said , adding that his article on the find had been accepted by the journal of human evolution and would be published soon .
he said no dna was in the fragments , but there had been some traces of protein . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 18.07.2008 tainted tour continues without fallen star ricco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricco was led away by french gendarmes prior to the start of the 12th stage of the tour the 13th stage of the tour de france got underway friday , july 18 in the city of narbonne with one of cycling 's young stars , riccardo ricco , sitting in jail after testing positive for a cutting-edge variant of epo . ricco was expected to be placed under investigation later friday in the city of mirepoix , where he spent the night behind bars because tests taken after the fourth stage of the race , on july 8 , detected the presence of cera -lrb- continuous erythropietin receptor activator -rrb- , a cutting-edge variant of the blood-boosting hormone epo , in his urine .
the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .
the stage has few difficulties and is likely to end in a mass sprint in which young british shooting star mark cavendish , who has proved himself to be by far the fastest finisher , will be looking for his fourth stage victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

koehler expressed his admiration for mandela in an article for the frankfurter rundschau newspaper 's friday edition .
mandela spent 27 years in prison for trying to overthrow the white-only apartheid regime in south africa .
after being elected president in 1994 , he promoted peace and multi-racial democracy .
reconcilliation was n't just a word for the man who established south africa 's truth and reconciliation comission , koehler wrote .
mandela 's commission remains the gold standard " for the political embodiment of reconciliation in the world , " koehler said .
mandela remains an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandela will celebrate with his family koehler said that mandela , who only served one term as president , sets an example for zimbabwe , where robert mugabe has refused to release his grip on power .
mandela completely retired from public life four years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 18.07.2008 tainted tour continues without fallen star ricco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricco was led away by french gendarmes prior to the start of the 12th stage of the tour the 13th stage of the tour de france got underway friday , july 18 in the city of narbonne with one of cycling 's young stars , riccardo ricco , sitting in jail after testing positive for a cutting-edge variant of epo . ricco was expected to be placed under investigation later friday in the city of mirepoix , where he spent the night behind bars because tests taken after the fourth stage of the race , on july 8 , detected the presence of cera -lrb- continuous erythropietin receptor activator -rrb- , a cutting-edge variant of the blood-boosting hormone epo , in his urine .
the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .

they spell trouble for the whole sector , he said . speaking thursday in washington , he called for higher standards in how banks and financial services firms manage their business risks .
he argued that the banking industry can not afford to be regulated only by market failures . the swiss native resorted to a familiar business to make his point . " if you are a chocolate manufacturer and your competitor goes out of business , maybe you are relieved , " ackermann said .
" not in banking . " nobody is too big to fail , he said , and banks are " too interconnected " to tolerate the collapse even of business rivals . " the problem of one bank , in an interconnected world , is a problem for many , " he said . ackermann spoke at the national press club in washington to promote a set of " best practices " issued thursday by the institute of international finance , which he chairs . new risk management strategy a report by the global association of 380 top banks and financial service companies found that responsibility for risk management should explicitly extend to bank chief executives .
it urged firms to evaluate their own risk exposure by more than one method , and that incentives for top executives should not encourage undue risk-taking . the report called for an external , independent review of rating agencies to re-establish market confidence in the system of bond ratings , which has been hit hard by the collapse of many formerly popular bonds that packaged large numbers of high-risk mortgages . ackermann announced that the iif would establish a market monitoring group to spot previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in the global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has not been immune from the financial crisis a year after the meltdown of the us mortgage market , the world 's largest economy is still struggling with the consequences .

they spell trouble for the whole sector , he said . speaking thursday in washington , he called for higher standards in how banks and financial services firms manage their business risks .
he argued that the banking industry can not afford to be regulated only by market failures . the swiss native resorted to a familiar business to make his point . " if you are a chocolate manufacturer and your competitor goes out of business , maybe you are relieved , " ackermann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 18.07.2008 scathing eu report exposes bulgaria 's high-level corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divisions between the eu and bulgaria have grown deeper since accession in 2007 in a withering indictment to be released next week , the european commission accuses bulgaria of high-level corruption and maladministration in the handling of eu funds .
the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .
this is work that is ongoing .
the document that i have seen circulated is not the latest draft .
the only report that matters is the one adopted on july 23 . "
problems exacerbated by organized crime and corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of bulgaria 's eu 's funding has gone unaccounted for the report , described by eu officials as the most scathing ever written about a member state , describes the endemic corruption which is undermining bulgarian efforts to fully integrate and efficiently operate within the eu : " high level corruption and organized crime exacerbates these problems of general weakness in administrative and judicial capacity .
" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .
bulgaria hires pr firms to polish image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption has tainted bulgaria 's eu membership in a bid to polish its image , bulgaria has taken the unusual step of hiring us and austrian public relations companies to handle the fallout from the accusations of organized crime and corruption .
according to data available from the website of the bulgarian public procurement agency , sofia signed a contract with austrian hochegger kommunikationsberatung for 1.87 million levs -lrb- $ 1.53 million -rrb- in taxpayers ' money last december for " a campaign for strengthening the positive image of bulgaria across the european union .

burns will join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and officials from britain , france , germany , russia and china for talks with iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saeid jalili is iran 's point man on nuclear negotiations " we are very pleased by the administration 's decision , " cristina gallach , solana 's spokeswoman , said in an interview with the new york times this week .
" it is a clear signal to the iranians of the engagement of the united states and its commitment to a negotiated solution .
at the same time , it is a clear message to the iranians of the seriousness of this exercise . "
world leaders are holding talks with iran to assess the response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt tehran 's covert uranium enrichment , which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons .
us involvement seen as a positive sign iran , too , has hailed the us ' participation in weekend talks .
" the american participation is positive , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference in damascus .
" we look forward to constructive engagement . "
france , who holds the current six-month rotating presidency of the european union , shared mottaki 's enthusiasm .
" the presence of an american is good news , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said this week .
" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .
but experts believe its engagement with iran is crucial in resolving the standoff since the us would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions .
last week , burns , who will attend the geneva talks , hinted that washington is considering opening a diplomatic mission in tehran for the first time in 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns hinted at further advances in us-iran relations opening a so-called interest section " is an interesting concept that is worth looking at carefully , " burns told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee .
us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .
" it 's too early to say whether there will be any progress , " he added .

kouchner noted that the three sets of un security council sanctions had not managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment , which the west fears could be used to make the fissile material of nuclear bombs .
france and french oil giants had frozen their investment in iran and kouchner said he hoped all countries would do the same .

the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .
this is work that is ongoing .
the document that i have seen circulated is not the latest draft .
the only report that matters is the one adopted on july 23 . "
problems exacerbated by organized crime and corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of bulgaria 's eu 's funding has gone unaccounted for the report , described by eu officials as the most scathing ever written about a member state , describes the endemic corruption which is undermining bulgarian efforts to fully integrate and efficiently operate within the eu : " high level corruption and organized crime exacerbates these problems of general weakness in administrative and judicial capacity .
" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .
bulgaria hires pr firms to polish image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption has tainted bulgaria 's eu membership in a bid to polish its image , bulgaria has taken the unusual step of hiring us and austrian public relations companies to handle the fallout from the accusations of organized crime and corruption .
according to data available from the website of the bulgarian public procurement agency , sofia signed a contract with austrian hochegger kommunikationsberatung for 1.87 million levs -lrb- $ 1.53 million -rrb- in taxpayers ' money last december for " a campaign for strengthening the positive image of bulgaria across the european union . "
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .
in an emailed statement to reuters , hochegger spokesman martin jenewein said : " hochegger 's assignment for the bulgarian government includes integrated communication services for the republic of bulgaria .
the scope of our consulting services is in communication enhancement and media relations . "
press visits to bulgaria organized and paid for by agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists have been flown in to interview pm stanishev the austrian agency is an associate of us-based pr consultancy burson-marsteller , which said it had done a small amount of work for the bulgarian government in brussels under the contract , mostly involving " outreach " to journalists .
robert mack , director of burson-marsteller in brussels , said that among those services was to arrange media appointments for rachel ehrenfeld , director of the new york-based american center for democracy , who has written articles saying bulgaria is being unfairly treated by the commission .
ehrenfeld visited bulgaria in may at the invitation of stanishev to conduct what she called " an independent study of bulgaria 's efforts to fight organized crime and corruption " , according to an article she wrote for the washington times .
" penalizing bulgaria will be counter-productive , " she concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .
" you would need strong political pressure from the entire european union , " union president dieter ondracek told afp news agency .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .

burns will join eu foreign policy chief javier solana and officials from britain , france , germany , russia and china for talks with iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saeid jalili is iran 's point man on nuclear negotiations " we are very pleased by the administration 's decision , " cristina gallach , solana 's spokeswoman , said in an interview with the new york times this week .
" it is a clear signal to the iranians of the engagement of the united states and its commitment to a negotiated solution .
at the same time , it is a clear message to the iranians of the seriousness of this exercise . "
world leaders are holding talks with iran to assess the response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt tehran 's covert uranium enrichment , which the west suspects is being used to develop nuclear weapons .
us involvement seen as a positive sign iran , too , has hailed the us ' participation in weekend talks .
" the american participation is positive , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference in damascus .
" we look forward to constructive engagement . "
france , who holds the current six-month rotating presidency of the european union , shared mottaki 's enthusiasm .
" the presence of an american is good news , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said this week .
" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .
but experts believe its engagement with iran is crucial in resolving the standoff since the us would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions .
last week , burns , who will attend the geneva talks , hinted that washington is considering opening a diplomatic mission in tehran for the first time in 30 years .

us officials said that the " new tactic " amounted to sending a signal to iran that washington wanted a negotiated settlement to the deadlock over iran 's refusal to bow to international demands .
washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends enrichment and insisted wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate .
" great hopes , low expectations " the new round of talks in geneva is aimed at finding a way to begin negotiations on two package proposals that both sides have presented in the past months .
while iran wants to keep enriching uranium during full negotiations , the other six countries set a suspension of nuclear activities as a precondition for further talks .
however , western leaders were careful to point out that us participation in the talks would not automatically mean they would end successfully .
" let 's put it this way : i foster great hopes for these talks , but i have only low expectations , " kouchner said .

kouchner noted that the three sets of un security council sanctions had not managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment , which the west fears could be used to make the fissile material of nuclear bombs .
france and french oil giants had frozen their investment in iran and kouchner said he hoped all countries would do the same .

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .
" you would need strong political pressure from the entire european union , " union president dieter ondracek told afp news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 18.07.2008 russia calls german peace plan for caucasus " helpful " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazhia 's separatists are n't as open to the german peace plan as russia russian foreign minister lavrov downplayed earlier criticism of a german peace plan aimed at resolving a conflict with georgia , saying it could break the deadlock .
abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" france has always said that not only sanctions need to be imposed , dialogue is necessary as well , " he said .
un resolutions and sanctions , aimed at coercing iran into suspending its nuclear activities , have not led to any results , kouchner said .
washington has had no relations with iran since 1980 .

his wife , who shares the hobby , found part of the temple two years later . the fragments , now believed to be the oldest human remains ever found in germany , are on display in a hanover museum . previously germany 's oldest remains were of another species , homo heidelbergensis , found in 1907 and dated at 600,000 years old . czarnetzki admitted that dating the remains was inexact , but said he was convinced by the similarity to finds since 1891 on java . " it suggests the asian ones spread to europe , " he said , adding that his article on the find had been accepted by the journal of human evolution and would be published soon .
he said no dna was in the fragments , but there had been some traces of protein . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .

tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .

it urged firms to evaluate their own risk exposure by more than one method , and that incentives for top executives should not encourage undue risk-taking . the report called for an external , independent review of rating agencies to re-establish market confidence in the system of bond ratings , which has been hit hard by the collapse of many formerly popular bonds that packaged large numbers of high-risk mortgages . ackermann announced that the iif would establish a market monitoring group to spot previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in the global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has not been immune from the financial crisis a year after the meltdown of the us mortgage market , the world 's largest economy is still struggling with the consequences .

" not in banking . " nobody is too big to fail , he said , and banks are " too interconnected " to tolerate the collapse even of business rivals . " the problem of one bank , in an interconnected world , is a problem for many , " he said . ackermann spoke at the national press club in washington to promote a set of " best practices " issued thursday by the institute of international finance , which he chairs . new risk management strategy a report by the global association of 380 top banks and financial service companies found that responsibility for risk management should explicitly extend to bank chief executives .
it urged firms to evaluate their own risk exposure by more than one method , and that incentives for top executives should not encourage undue risk-taking . the report called for an external , independent review of rating agencies to re-establish market confidence in the system of bond ratings , which has been hit hard by the collapse of many formerly popular bonds that packaged large numbers of high-risk mortgages . ackermann announced that the iif would establish a market monitoring group to spot previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in the global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has not been immune from the financial crisis a year after the meltdown of the us mortgage market , the world 's largest economy is still struggling with the consequences .

he also named three mediators with instructions to find a way out of the crisis : two french-speaking politicians , francois-xavier de donnea and raymond langendries , as well as karl-heinz lambertz from german-speaking belgium . albert urged the government to give full support to the reconciliation efforts . leterme heads a coalition that has tried to bridge the long-standing language rivalry between the 6.5 million dutch-speaking flemish people and the four million french-speaking walloons . both sides have been trying to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region has stirred particularly strong feelings . the formation in march of the leterme government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , had appeared to resolve a nine-month political crisis - the longest in the country 's history - following the june 2007 elections . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .
this is work that is ongoing .

" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .
bulgaria hires pr firms to polish image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption has tainted bulgaria 's eu membership in a bid to polish its image , bulgaria has taken the unusual step of hiring us and austrian public relations companies to handle the fallout from the accusations of organized crime and corruption .

"
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .
in an emailed statement to reuters , hochegger spokesman martin jenewein said : " hochegger 's assignment for the bulgarian government includes integrated communication services for the republic of bulgaria .

robert mack , director of burson-marsteller in brussels , said that among those services was to arrange media appointments for rachel ehrenfeld , director of the new york-based american center for democracy , who has written articles saying bulgaria is being unfairly treated by the commission .
ehrenfeld visited bulgaria in may at the invitation of stanishev to conduct what she called " an independent study of bulgaria 's efforts to fight organized crime and corruption " , according to an article she wrote for the washington times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 18.07.2008 scathing eu report exposes bulgaria 's high-level corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divisions between the eu and bulgaria have grown deeper since accession in 2007 in a withering indictment to be released next week , the european commission accuses bulgaria of high-level corruption and maladministration in the handling of eu funds .
the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .
european commission spokesman mark gray told reporters : " i am not going to deny the existence of a report on eu funding .
this is work that is ongoing .
the document that i have seen circulated is not the latest draft .
the only report that matters is the one adopted on july 23 . "
problems exacerbated by organized crime and corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of bulgaria 's eu 's funding has gone unaccounted for the report , described by eu officials as the most scathing ever written about a member state , describes the endemic corruption which is undermining bulgarian efforts to fully integrate and efficiently operate within the eu : " high level corruption and organized crime exacerbates these problems of general weakness in administrative and judicial capacity .
" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .
unpaid funding to be suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission intends to stop paying out the report said payments to two key implementing agencies had been suspended , estimating the amount of funds effected to be around 610 million euros , of which 250 million euros has not been contracted .
" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .
other effected agencies include the national authorizing officer for the sapard agricultural marketing program , with 210 million euros yet to be paid , and the national road infrastructure fund , for which funding for road building worth 144 million euros has been frozen .
bulgaria hires pr firms to polish image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption has tainted bulgaria 's eu membership in a bid to polish its image , bulgaria has taken the unusual step of hiring us and austrian public relations companies to handle the fallout from the accusations of organized crime and corruption .
according to data available from the website of the bulgarian public procurement agency , sofia signed a contract with austrian hochegger kommunikationsberatung for 1.87 million levs -lrb- $ 1.53 million -rrb- in taxpayers ' money last december for " a campaign for strengthening the positive image of bulgaria across the european union . "
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .
in an emailed statement to reuters , hochegger spokesman martin jenewein said : " hochegger 's assignment for the bulgarian government includes integrated communication services for the republic of bulgaria .
the scope of our consulting services is in communication enhancement and media relations . "
press visits to bulgaria organized and paid for by agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists have been flown in to interview pm stanishev the austrian agency is an associate of us-based pr consultancy burson-marsteller , which said it had done a small amount of work for the bulgarian government in brussels under the contract , mostly involving " outreach " to journalists .
robert mack , director of burson-marsteller in brussels , said that among those services was to arrange media appointments for rachel ehrenfeld , director of the new york-based american center for democracy , who has written articles saying bulgaria is being unfairly treated by the commission .
ehrenfeld visited bulgaria in may at the invitation of stanishev to conduct what she called " an independent study of bulgaria 's efforts to fight organized crime and corruption " , according to an article she wrote for the washington times .
" penalizing bulgaria will be counter-productive , " she concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the italian became the third cyclist to leave the race after manuel beltran and moises duenas of spain .
suspicion has also fallen on his saunier duval team , which dominated the early mountain stages of the tour and dropped out of the race after the announcement of ricco 's test result .
the entire team left the tour of their own accord prior to thursday 's 12th stage .
tour boss reserves judgement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen if the saunier duval team is guilty tour director christian prudhomme said thursday that there were two ways to regard the team voluntarily leaving the tour : " we can view them as responsible or it can look like a confession .
the near future will tell us . "
saunier duval sacked ricco following his positive doping control test .
team manager mauro gianetti said in a statement that ricco had infringed the team 's code of ethics .
ricco 's italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also sacked .
the 24-year-old ricco won two stages on this year 's race but left the tour under a police escort on thursday following his positive test for the banned blood booster after the fourth stage time trial .
piepoli did not fail a doping control while he was at the race .
the 37-year-old won the prestigious 10th stage to the summit finish of hautacam in the pyrenees .
ricco 's positive test is not only another damaging crisis for the tour but also a major blow for italian cycling .
a blow to the tour and italian cycling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liquigas have their own scandal with manuel beltran team liquigas manager stefano zanatta believes the fall from grace of one of italy 's top cycling stars will reflect badly on italian cycling as a whole , but also on ricco 's past results , including this season 's runner-up finish in the giro d 'italia .
" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .

" i believe things are changing for better in the sport , but there 's always going to be someone who does n't respect the rules , " zanatta told reporters prior to the race 's 13th stage .
" what has happened with ricco , i hope , is an isolated case - but there 's no doubt it looks bad .
it looks bad on him , for his fans and on the sport of cycling in italy . "
he added : " ricco passed all the anti-doping controls at the giro , but now some people are going to be looking at his results and wondering .
it 's inevitable . "
ricco , a brash 24-year-old climber regarded as aloof and arrogant by much of the peloton , came into the tour declaring which stages he would like to win .
ricco 's tour ends in jail bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco was seen as the great hope of italian cycling before his shameful arrest the italian promptly won stage six at super-besse in the massif central , and the first stage in the pyrenees at bagneres-de-bigorre , the next day watching teammate leonardo piepoli claim a prestigious win atop the hautacam .
ricco 's incarceration meant that he did not get as far as the 15th stage 's summit finish at prato nevoso climb in his home nation of italy .
zanatta can fully empathize with thursday 's events .
the full glare of the doping spotlight fell on liquigas when beltran , a former teammate of seven-time tour champion lance armstrong , was revealed as a cheat .
and the imminent arrival to the team of italian star ivan basso , who will soon return from a doping ban relating to the operation puerto affair , has shed some controversy on his team .
shamed beltran awaiting test and career fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beltran is no longer smiling zanatta confirmed that the 37-year-old beltran , who is currently suspended , will be sacked if the analysis on a b sample - due out next week - confirms his first doping positive .
" for us , it remains an isolated case , " added zanatta , although the italian admitted his team had not yet established the kind of strict internal anti-doping program currently being used by csc , columbia and garmin .
" we do n't have that kind of system in place yet , but all our riders are regularly subject to random tests .
i hope we can show that we 've nothing to hide , " he said .
as a result of the doping results , only 158 riders were at the start of friday 's stage , a 182-kilometre course from narbonne to the city of nimes .
australian cadel evans began the race with a one-second lead over frank schleck of luxembourg , with american christian vandevelde 38 seconds behind in third place .
the stage has few difficulties and is likely to end in a mass sprint in which young british shooting star mark cavendish , who has proved himself to be by far the fastest finisher , will be looking for his fourth stage victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abkhazia 's separatists however have rejected the plan . speaking after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in moscow on friday , july 18 , lavrov said berlin 's peace plan was " extremely helpful for looking for compromises and a way out of the crisis . "
" we believe that the logic of your plan is absolutely the right one , " lavrov told steinmeier at a joint news conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , right , told steinmeier the plan could break the deadlock lavrov 's comments seemed to soften his earlier criticism of the german peace proposal which he said was " unrealistic " over the return of georgian refugees .
" it -lrb- the plan -rrb- is a step in the right direction , " said lavrov .
" there is , however , a problem with wanting to sign at the same time an agreement on not resorting to violence and another on the return of refugees .
it is absolutely unrealistic , " he said .
steinmeier traveled to georgia and its russian-backed region breakaway region of abkhazia on thursday and is in moscow on friday to mediate among all sides as tensions simmer between russia and georgia .
three-stage peace blueprint georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war ended in 1994 .
but moscow 's recent moves to strengthen diplomatic ties and increase its peacekeeping mission in the region has set off a dangerous row with tbilisi , who says such steps amount to the creeping annexation of its territory .
steinmeier , who won support for his plan on thursday from president mikhail saakashvili of georgia , has said that its main component was restarting direct contact between tbilisi and the abkhaz separatists .
the three-phase peace plan , blessed by the so-called united nations group of friends , calls for an end to the violence , confidence-building measures over the next year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between georgia and abkhazia , and the repatriation of about 250,000 georgian refugees to abkhazia who fled in the early 1990s during the soviet union 's breakup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers in abkhazia the second phase would involve developing joint reconstruction projects while the third and most tricky step would be to determine abkhazia 's future status .
lavrov said earlier it was unlikely georgia would quickly withdraw its forces from the kodori gorge , the only part of abkhazia controlled by tbilisi .
" we do n't see the will , " he said as both moscow and the abkhazia separatists made the withdrawal a prerequisite for all discussion with the georgians .
abkhazian separatists rebuff plan earlier georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia too rejected steinmeier 's peace plan as " unacceptable . "
" these offers are unacceptable to us ...
we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state and this not open to discussion , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagapsh rejected the plans as " unacceptable " to abkhazia " we do not agree with the proposed plan in principle , " bagapsh was quoted by ria novosti as saying .
" we have proposed that the german foreign minister include in the document two points .
the first one : the withdrawal of georgian troops from upper kodori gorge ; the second one : signing of a treaty on the non-use of force .
" a return of georgian refugees -lrb- to abkhazia -rrb- would certainly lead to a new war , " he added .
experts say western intervention a positive sign this is the first time germany has taken on a mediatory role in the caucasus region which is plagued by regional conflicts .
analysts believe that efforts by western diplomatic to defuse the tensions may not yield immediate results , but they have already changed matters by depriving russia of exclusive control of the situation .
europe and the united states attempted to end the dangerous dispute over georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia " as tensions reached an extremely high temperature , " archil gegeshidze , a political analyst at the georgian foundation for strategic and international studies , told afp news agency .
" the eu and the united states seek a stable and democratic georgia " with its oil and gas pipelines connecting the caspian sea to turkey and its strategic location in the eastern edge of the european continent , he added .
as for russia , which has grown more assertive in recent years , restoring influence in the south caucasus is largely seen by its political elite as an " existential issue , " gegeshidze said .
the row over abkhazia and another separatist georgian region , south ossetia , is at the heart of increasingly bitter relations between moscow and tbilisi , amid russia 's broader offensive against western influence in its former soviet backyard .
the increase in tensions has helped moscow impede its neighbor 's bid for membership in the nato military alliance .
but now the region has seen a flurry of western diplomatic activity , including visits by us secretary of state condoleezza rice and steinmeier .
escalating tensions although the self-proclaimed governments of abkhazia and south ossetia , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s , are not formally recognized by any state , russia tacitly supports the separatists and maintains peacekeeping troops in the two regions .
tensions mounted further this month after the border between abkhazia and georgia was rocked by six explosions , which killed four people including a translator from the united nations .
the abkhaz leadership blamed the blasts on georgia , and moscow 's admission that it had sent military jets on flights over south ossetia .
the incidents raised memories of the two regions ' separatist wars in the early 1990s , which killed several thousand people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
steinmeier says peace " a common duty " " in light of the escalation in the last weeks and months , we all have a common duty to help defuse the situation , " german foreign minister steinmeier said on friday after meeting abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . .
" the west is giving georgia a chance to resolve the crisis through a sophisticated diplomatic game , " tornike sharashenidze , an analyst at the georgian institute of public affairs , told afp news agency .
" georgia now has to demonstrate its ability to follow this process with patience .
otherwise it risks losing western support , " he said .
the german diplomat said all parties to the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
" with this goal we have presented a three-phase plan for the settlement of the conflict , " steinmeier was quoted by interfax as saying .
" both sides ' positions are still very far from each other and we need to create the conditions for a dialogue , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

judges in bochum on friday handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a 66-year-old real estate tycoon in the first case brought to justice in germany in connection with a major liechtenstein tax evasion scandal . judges in the western german city of bochum told the first multi-millionaire up for trial he would probably receive a suspended term of two years ' jail for evading 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- in tax between 2001 and 2006 .
elmar schulte , from the western city of bad homburg , was found guilty of six counts of tax evasion after depositing several million euros in the alpine principality of liechtenstein and failing to declare the interest made .
he had made a full confession and already paid 7.6 million euros in back taxes and fines to german tax authorities .
germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service described in february how it bought data on trusts managed by the liechtenstein bank ltg on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans .
the bnd reportedly paid about 4 million euros for one dvd with the data .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered 110 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials , according to a prosecutor , eduard gueroff , quoted friday by the newspaper westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
other european nations have mounted similar sweeps using the leaked data .
widespread sweep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior prosecutor hans-ulrich krueck heads the case prosecutors in bochum said they have opened inquiries against about 700 tax dodgers all over germany .
under german tax law , they were supposed to report all dividends and interest earned abroad by trusts that they fully controlled .
liechtenstein has angrily denied abetting tax evasion , but also refuses to disclose whose money it is keeping , saying it is up to bank clients to honestly report their income in their home nations .
the scandal broke in february when police identified klaus zumwinkel , chief executive of world parcels and mail carrier deutsche post , as a suspect .
tv news trucks staked out his home as it was searched and he resigned his post .
many scared taxpayers turned themselves in , even if they were not named on the dvd .
the newspaper quoted gueroff saying that after 200 searches of homes and offices , prosecutors were still not finished .
" we 're doing a bit more raiding again at the moment , " he said .
the german raids have highlighted the sensitive issue of tax havens protected by historic and seemingly ironclad policies of bank secrecy .
merkel urges transparancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made her case clear to liechtenstein 's pm hasler as widespread searches continued in connection with the biggest tax fraud probe in german history , german chancellor angela merkel said she sought " a comparable level of transparency " with liechtenstein as with european union states , given that a full tax harmonization was not possible .
the chancellor noted that liechtenstein , which is not an eu member , " is a country about which we still have questions . "
those questions likely include how hundreds of wealthy germans were allegedly able to hide an estimated several billion euros in lightly-taxed liechtenstein foundations , depriving government coffers of several hundred million euros in taxes .
while it is not illegal to put money into the miniscule principality wedged between switzerland and austria , failing to declare the funds is punishable by prison terms of up to 10 years because german law expects taxes to be paid in an individual 's country of origin .
the union of german tax officials estimates that such tax evasion amounts to around 10 billion euros annually .
strict banking laws maintain secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein 's banking system provides in-built secrecy in liechtenstein , strict banking secrecy laws provide protection from fiscal services in other countries .
germany ended up paying between four and five million euros for information on the alleged german fraudsters to a mysterious informer who officials in liechtenstein say stole the data in 2002 .
" all the same , it is scandalous that in the heart of europe , countries like liechtenstein , but also switzerland , do not consider fiscal fraud a felony but just a simple misdemeanor , like traffic violations , " commented caspar von hauenschild of the anti-corruption group transparency international .
" the reality is that liechtenstein actively aids tax evasion , that it has made it an entirely separate economic activity . "
liechtenstein is termed an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , along with two other principalities , andorra , between france and spain , and monaco on the mediterranean coast near the french border with italy .
oecd slams tax haven 's attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd says tax havens are a relic of times gone by " excessive bank secrecy rules and a failure to exchange information on foreign tax evaders are relics of a different time and have no role to play in the relations between democratic societies , " oecd secretary-general angel gurria said tuesday in a statement .
other fiscal havens often singled out include guernsey and jersey in the channel islands , or the bahamas and cayman islands .
in theory , european havens agreed in 2005 to withhold taxes on accounts held by foreigners and to remit most of the amount to their country of residence , starting at 15 percent and slated to increase to 20 and finally 35 percent .
in exchange , liechtenstein , along with andorra , austria , belgium , luxembourg , monaco , san marino and switzerland were not obliged to provide details on funds placed in financial institutions on their territory .
but policy gaps still allow family foundations in places like liechtenstein to be used by those who seek to evade taxation .
taxes on earned interest can be as little as 0.05 percent .
that compares with german taxes , including capital gains , which will reach as high as 28 percent starting in january 2009 .
the german tax officials union predicted that merkel alone would not be able to fight fiscal havens and win .

the report outlines measures to freeze further aid . new european union member bulgaria has already crossed the bloc 's ruling powers just over eighteen months after joining the eu .
as a result of investigations into the management of eu funds in the bloc 's most recent and poorest newcomer , the eu report will confirm that it has banned four bulgarian agencies from handling eu funds because of corruption , freezing nearly 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in pre-accession aid and threatening future payments .
in leaked statements reprinted earlier this week , eu investigators said that , among other discrepancies , they had found that bulgaria had misused money from eu farm aid projects worth some 32 million euros .
the eu report described a " criminal network " of more than 50 bulgarian companies and foreign-based firms , centered on two businessmen with alleged ties to top bulgarian politicians , the focus news agency reported .
deputy prime minister meglena plugchieva , the bulgarian official overseeing eu funds , said she was angered that the confidential report by the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- to her government was leaked .
" the olaf report was not meant for the media , " she said .

" bulgaria is not able to reap the full benefits of this assistance because of critical weaknesses in administrative and judicial capacity , be it at local , regional or central levels , " said the report .
" urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching , after which the funds will be lost to bulgaria , " it added .
the final figure for frozen funds may be smaller because some of the money has already been spent , but bulgaria stands to lose nearly half a billion euros by the end of the year unless it can remedy flaws in its payments agencies , an eu statement released on friday said .

" as a consequence , these agencies will not be allowed to contract until they can guarantee that effective , functioning management and control systems are in place , " it said .

"
hochegger , which said it won the pr contract on a competitive tender , has since organized and in some cases paid for european journalists to visit sofia and interview prime minister sergei stanishev and other government officials .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .
yet larov seems to remain pessimistic about the peace plan .

it is also not known whether russia will support the plan . georgia 's rebel separatist region of abkhazia on friday rejected as " unacceptable " an international peace plan for calming escalating tensions in the region .
" these offers are unacceptable to us , " abkhaz president sergei bagapsh said on friday , july 18 . " we are not prepared to discuss the status of abkhazia , which is already for many our republic .
abkhazia is an independent state , and this not open to discussion . "
bagapsh made the remarks after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the town of gali on the separatist region 's border with georgia .
steinmeier began a two-day tour of the region yesterday , hoping to restart peace talks between georgia and the russian-backed rebel region .
tensions remain high on the heels of the meeting , steinmeier said all parties in the conflict had an obligation to prevent the crisis from escalating .
georgia said the situation was on the brink of war last month over mutual accusations of troop buildups and spying with russia .
russia and a georgian-american coalition were holding mass military exercises on their respective sides of the caucasus region this week , maneuvers frowned upon by european allies .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years .
russia could be softening stance steinmeier was due in moscow later friday to meet with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov .
russia on friday called steinmeier 's efforts to rekindle peace talks " constructive . "
" steinmeier 's activity has constructive character , " a foreign ministry source told interfax news agency .
" he knows our standpoint well and is at this moment in -lrb- the abkhaz capital of -rrb- sukhumi to familiarize himself with the abkhaz position . "
the foreign ministry 's praise for steinmeier 's initiative was a marked contrast to moscow 's previous intransigence over growing western concerns .

" the remains belong to the homo erectus species , whereas modern humans are homo sapiens . karl-werner frangenberg , a fossil-hunter , found part of the skullcap in 2002 at a gravel pit at leinetal near hanover .
his wife , who shares the hobby , found part of the temple two years later . the fragments , now believed to be the oldest human remains ever found in germany , are on display in a hanover museum . previously germany 's oldest remains were of another species , homo heidelbergensis , found in 1907 and dated at 600,000 years old . czarnetzki admitted that dating the remains was inexact , but said he was convinced by the similarity to finds since 1891 on java . " it suggests the asian ones spread to europe , " he said , adding that his article on the find had been accepted by the journal of human evolution and would be published soon .

the report looked at independent police complaints commission recommendations after the shooting of the brazilian in the wake of the 2005 london bombings .
the metropolitan police authority study said the force had made substantial progress but more needed to be done .
the met said it had been praised for its progress over the recommendations .

it raised concerns about the length of time being taken to agree surveillance " technological support mechanisms " and about " fundamental differences in ethos " between the " crime " and " counter-terrorism " surveillance teams .
it also recommended an end to the practice of officers conferring to produce notes after operations , which it said was " clearly open to misinterpretation and suspicion " .
the report added that many of the issues faced by the met in july 2005 were likely to present themselves again at the olympics in 2012 , if not before , " and potentially on a far larger scale " .
the met said in response that it had implemented a range of measures since the death of mr menezes to minimise the risk of a similar tragedy repeating itself in the future .
it added that an inspectorate of constabulary report had concluded its progress in implementing the ipcc recommendations to be " significant , sustainable and often innovative " .
mr de menezes , 27 , was shot by police at stockwell tube station , south london , after being mistaken for a terrorist days after the 7 july bombings .

the report looked at independent police complaints commission recommendations after the shooting of the brazilian in the wake of the 2005 london bombings .
the metropolitan police authority study said the force had made substantial progress but more needed to be done .
the met said it had been praised for its progress over the recommendations .
firearms team the metropolitan police authority said gaps in technology needed to be addressed and the airwave radio system needed to be rolled out fully , especially on the tube .
it raised concerns about the length of time being taken to agree surveillance " technological support mechanisms " and about " fundamental differences in ethos " between the " crime " and " counter-terrorism " surveillance teams .
it also recommended an end to the practice of officers conferring to produce notes after operations , which it said was " clearly open to misinterpretation and suspicion " .
the report added that many of the issues faced by the met in july 2005 were likely to present themselves again at the olympics in 2012 , if not before , " and potentially on a far larger scale " .
the met said in response that it had implemented a range of measures since the death of mr menezes to minimise the risk of a similar tragedy repeating itself in the future .
it added that an inspectorate of constabulary report had concluded its progress in implementing the ipcc recommendations to be " significant , sustainable and often innovative " .
mr de menezes , 27 , was shot by police at stockwell tube station , south london , after being mistaken for a terrorist days after the 7 july bombings .

up until now , china has tightly regulated the number of people allowed to travel to taiwan , with fewer than 300,000 visiting each year , compared to nearly five million trips made to china by taiwanese visitors .
officials hope the exchanges will help to build more trust and lower tensions between the two sides , who split amid civil war in 1949 .
economic boost the government here also hopes the new arrivals will provide an important boost to the local economy .
and , if the spending habits of the first group of chinese visitors earlier this month was anything to go by , those expectations are likely to be realised .
local media reported that the first group of more than 700 visitors spent around $ 1.3m -lrb- £ 650,000 -rrb- - an average of $ 1,857 per person - and that the figure was a conservative estimate .
the agreements on flights and tourists fulfil an election pledge by president ma .
he had promised voters he would boost the island 's economy - and push for a better , less confrontational relationship with china , which still regards the island as part of its territory .

along the way , the band transformed from cocky irish upstarts into bona fide rock stars , eventually reaching number one with 1983 's war .
as the band release re-mastered versions of those early recordings , complete with bonus tracks and new artwork , lillywhite recalls the tension , tedium and inspirations behind the recording sessions .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement steve lillywhite talks through the recording of four early u2 tracks boy -lrb- 1980 -rrb- debut album boy reached number 52 in the uk charts u2 's first album was recorded when the band were all under 21 , and its title references their youthful naivety .
it was originally going to be produced by joy division cohort martin hannett , but he dropped out after singer ian curtis committed suicide .
i always remember on that first album , i was sitting at the mixing desk with the band behind me and suddenly i heard all this giggling .
i turned around and suddenly they all went sheepish , shushing each other like teacher was looking at them .
i think they would admit that , like all teenage boys , they had n't lived long enough to acquire a personality … there was n't much talking in the studio .
it was quite serious .
we recorded in a place called windmill lane in dublin .
it was great for traditional irish music but no irish rock band had recorded there .
thin lizzy came to london to make their records .
the boomtown rats did n't record in ireland either .
the band said lillywhite was " like a children 's tv presenter " so the studio crew were very surprised when i decided i wanted to record the drums out in the hallway by the receptionist , as there was this wonderful clattery sound i wanted to get .
but that meant we could n't record until the evening , because this girl was sat answering the phones all the day .
even then , we could n't turn the ringer off the phone so occasionally it would go off mid-take .
it was all pretty slapdash .
but funnily enough , it 's not unlike how the band still records .
october -lrb- 1981 -rrb- the edge says u2 " had very few new songs of merit " going into the studio more low-key and introspective than its predecessor , october received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with bono 's brooding .
recording sessions were overshadowed by concerns that the music industry was at odds with the singer 's religious beliefs - and those of his bandmates edge and larry mullen .
another setback came when a briefcase full of lyrics was stolen , forcing bono to rewrite some of the songs .
u2 could have gone two ways after boy .
they could have broken out and gone bigger - but in fact what they did was they shrunk a little bit .
they were a little bit scared of the world , i think .
yes , there were bibles dotted around the room during the recording .
there was a fair amount of that .
but i was so busy trying to pull teeth - trying to make an album - that it sort of washed over me .
it was completely chaotic and mad in the studio and , obviously , bono 's lyrics being lost contributed to the atmosphere .
i 'm not sure whether any of those words would have been used on the album - only he knows that - but certainly it would have been a starting point .
bono has to sing these songs for two years on the road .
he always says : " i 'm a travelling salesman .
i need to make sure my vacuum cleaner is the best vacuum cleaner there is " steve lillywhite but what came out was quite serene in a strange way .
one song - scarlet - only has one word : " rejoice " .
people do n't do songs like that any more .
in the end , october was n't a big record .
after the rock and roll things they tickled on the first album , people were expecting something that was a bit more " rawk " .
what they got , in fact , was perhaps an indication of where the band would go later on in their career .
the joshua tree was probably where they married the sensibilities of those first two albums and that was where they struck gold .
war -lrb- 1983 -rrb- bono wanted an album " that would separate us from our contemporaries " u2 's third album saw them break through into the mainstream - even knocking michael jackson 's thriller off the top of the uk charts .
re-energised and re-focused , the band also gained a political edge with songs like sunday bloody sunday .
the band had been questioning whether their beliefs could coincide with their new experiences .
and in the end it was their manager paul mcguinness who sat down and said , " do n't be so silly , you can have them both " .
in his sort of matter-of-fact way , he convinced them that the world would be better if they carried on making music .
but i think we all realised that there 'd been a step back with october and that , if we were going to go for it , we had to have the urgency of the first album .
i remember bono saying to the edge , " do n't be like the edge .
be like mick jones from the clash " .
because edge is like a scientist .
he has the white coat on and pencils in his pocket .
and i think what bono wanted him to do was take off the white coat and put on the star-studded leather jacket .
lillywhite shares u2 's grammy for how to dismantle an atom bomb preceding the album , all the band had their first vacation in a long time .
i went with paul mcguinness and adam to tuscany .
edge was the only one who stayed at home .
and he presented us with sunday bloody sunday when we got back .
and we just went , " wow , this is really good " .
i listened to the album the other day and certainly new year 's day is a spectacular piece of work .
it 's sonically great , it 's mature , and edge 's piano-playing - he 's got such a great touch .
and that bassline was adam 's finest moment .
but it 's funny , we did n't think of it as a single .
it was one of the young interns in the studio who first said to me , " that song is brilliant " .
and we all went , " oh , really ? "
one of the strange things about that album is that we used kid creole 's backing singers , the coconuts .
they just happened to be in dublin on tour , so we hung out with them and they came in and sang on surrender .
so it was sort of random - this serious irish rock band having the coconuts on their album .
but there 's nothing u2 like better than a pretty woman .
the new versions of boy , october and war are released on 21 july by island records .
steve lillywhite was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter mark savage .

along the way , the band transformed from cocky irish upstarts into bona fide rock stars , eventually reaching number one with 1983 's war .
as the band release re-mastered versions of those early recordings , complete with bonus tracks and new artwork , lillywhite recalls the tension , tedium and inspirations behind the recording sessions .

advertisement steve lillywhite talks through the recording of four early u2 tracks boy -lrb- 1980 -rrb- debut album boy reached number 52 in the uk charts u2 's first album was recorded when the band were all under 21 , and its title references their youthful naivety .
it was originally going to be produced by joy division cohort martin hannett , but he dropped out after singer ian curtis committed suicide .
i always remember on that first album , i was sitting at the mixing desk with the band behind me and suddenly i heard all this giggling .
i turned around and suddenly they all went sheepish , shushing each other like teacher was looking at them .
i think they would admit that , like all teenage boys , they had n't lived long enough to acquire a personality … there was n't much talking in the studio .
it was quite serious .
we recorded in a place called windmill lane in dublin .
it was great for traditional irish music but no irish rock band had recorded there .
thin lizzy came to london to make their records .
the boomtown rats did n't record in ireland either .
the band said lillywhite was " like a children 's tv presenter " so the studio crew were very surprised when i decided i wanted to record the drums out in the hallway by the receptionist , as there was this wonderful clattery sound i wanted to get .
but that meant we could n't record until the evening , because this girl was sat answering the phones all the day .
even then , we could n't turn the ringer off the phone so occasionally it would go off mid-take .
it was all pretty slapdash .
but funnily enough , it 's not unlike how the band still records .
october -lrb- 1981 -rrb- the edge says u2 " had very few new songs of merit " going into the studio more low-key and introspective than its predecessor , october received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with bono 's brooding .
recording sessions were overshadowed by concerns that the music industry was at odds with the singer 's religious beliefs - and those of his bandmates edge and larry mullen .
another setback came when a briefcase full of lyrics was stolen , forcing bono to rewrite some of the songs .
u2 could have gone two ways after boy .
they could have broken out and gone bigger - but in fact what they did was they shrunk a little bit .
they were a little bit scared of the world , i think .
yes , there were bibles dotted around the room during the recording .
there was a fair amount of that .
but i was so busy trying to pull teeth - trying to make an album - that it sort of washed over me .
it was completely chaotic and mad in the studio and , obviously , bono 's lyrics being lost contributed to the atmosphere .
i 'm not sure whether any of those words would have been used on the album - only he knows that - but certainly it would have been a starting point .
bono has to sing these songs for two years on the road .
he always says : " i 'm a travelling salesman .
i need to make sure my vacuum cleaner is the best vacuum cleaner there is " steve lillywhite but what came out was quite serene in a strange way .
one song - scarlet - only has one word : " rejoice " .
people do n't do songs like that any more .
in the end , october was n't a big record .
after the rock and roll things they tickled on the first album , people were expecting something that was a bit more " rawk " .
what they got , in fact , was perhaps an indication of where the band would go later on in their career .
the joshua tree was probably where they married the sensibilities of those first two albums and that was where they struck gold .
war -lrb- 1983 -rrb- bono wanted an album " that would separate us from our contemporaries " u2 's third album saw them break through into the mainstream - even knocking michael jackson 's thriller off the top of the uk charts .
re-energised and re-focused , the band also gained a political edge with songs like sunday bloody sunday .
the band had been questioning whether their beliefs could coincide with their new experiences .
and in the end it was their manager paul mcguinness who sat down and said , " do n't be so silly , you can have them both " .
in his sort of matter-of-fact way , he convinced them that the world would be better if they carried on making music .
but i think we all realised that there 'd been a step back with october and that , if we were going to go for it , we had to have the urgency of the first album .
i remember bono saying to the edge , " do n't be like the edge .
be like mick jones from the clash " .
because edge is like a scientist .
he has the white coat on and pencils in his pocket .
and i think what bono wanted him to do was take off the white coat and put on the star-studded leather jacket .
lillywhite shares u2 's grammy for how to dismantle an atom bomb preceding the album , all the band had their first vacation in a long time .
i went with paul mcguinness and adam to tuscany .
edge was the only one who stayed at home .
and he presented us with sunday bloody sunday when we got back .
and we just went , " wow , this is really good " .
i listened to the album the other day and certainly new year 's day is a spectacular piece of work .
it 's sonically great , it 's mature , and edge 's piano-playing - he 's got such a great touch .
and that bassline was adam 's finest moment .
but it 's funny , we did n't think of it as a single .
it was one of the young interns in the studio who first said to me , " that song is brilliant " .
and we all went , " oh , really ? "
one of the strange things about that album is that we used kid creole 's backing singers , the coconuts .
they just happened to be in dublin on tour , so we hung out with them and they came in and sang on surrender .
so it was sort of random - this serious irish rock band having the coconuts on their album .
but there 's nothing u2 like better than a pretty woman .
the new versions of boy , october and war are released on 21 july by island records .
steve lillywhite was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter mark savage .

october -lrb- 1981 -rrb- the edge says u2 " had very few new songs of merit " going into the studio more low-key and introspective than its predecessor , october received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with bono 's brooding .
recording sessions were overshadowed by concerns that the music industry was at odds with the singer 's religious beliefs - and those of his bandmates edge and larry mullen .
another setback came when a briefcase full of lyrics was stolen , forcing bono to rewrite some of the songs .
u2 could have gone two ways after boy .
they could have broken out and gone bigger - but in fact what they did was they shrunk a little bit .
they were a little bit scared of the world , i think .
yes , there were bibles dotted around the room during the recording .
there was a fair amount of that .
but i was so busy trying to pull teeth - trying to make an album - that it sort of washed over me .
it was completely chaotic and mad in the studio and , obviously , bono 's lyrics being lost contributed to the atmosphere .
i 'm not sure whether any of those words would have been used on the album - only he knows that - but certainly it would have been a starting point .
bono has to sing these songs for two years on the road .
he always says : " i 'm a travelling salesman .
i need to make sure my vacuum cleaner is the best vacuum cleaner there is " steve lillywhite but what came out was quite serene in a strange way .
one song - scarlet - only has one word : " rejoice " .
people do n't do songs like that any more .
in the end , october was n't a big record .
after the rock and roll things they tickled on the first album , people were expecting something that was a bit more " rawk " .
what they got , in fact , was perhaps an indication of where the band would go later on in their career .
the joshua tree was probably where they married the sensibilities of those first two albums and that was where they struck gold .
war -lrb- 1983 -rrb- bono wanted an album " that would separate us from our contemporaries " u2 's third album saw them break through into the mainstream - even knocking michael jackson 's thriller off the top of the uk charts .
re-energised and re-focused , the band also gained a political edge with songs like sunday bloody sunday .
the band had been questioning whether their beliefs could coincide with their new experiences .
and in the end it was their manager paul mcguinness who sat down and said , " do n't be so silly , you can have them both " .
in his sort of matter-of-fact way , he convinced them that the world would be better if they carried on making music .
but i think we all realised that there 'd been a step back with october and that , if we were going to go for it , we had to have the urgency of the first album .
i remember bono saying to the edge , " do n't be like the edge .
be like mick jones from the clash " .
because edge is like a scientist .
he has the white coat on and pencils in his pocket .
and i think what bono wanted him to do was take off the white coat and put on the star-studded leather jacket .
lillywhite shares u2 's grammy for how to dismantle an atom bomb preceding the album , all the band had their first vacation in a long time .
i went with paul mcguinness and adam to tuscany .
edge was the only one who stayed at home .
and he presented us with sunday bloody sunday when we got back .
and we just went , " wow , this is really good " .
i listened to the album the other day and certainly new year 's day is a spectacular piece of work .
it 's sonically great , it 's mature , and edge 's piano-playing - he 's got such a great touch .
and that bassline was adam 's finest moment .
but it 's funny , we did n't think of it as a single .
it was one of the young interns in the studio who first said to me , " that song is brilliant " .
and we all went , " oh , really ? "
one of the strange things about that album is that we used kid creole 's backing singers , the coconuts .
they just happened to be in dublin on tour , so we hung out with them and they came in and sang on surrender .
so it was sort of random - this serious irish rock band having the coconuts on their album .
but there 's nothing u2 like better than a pretty woman .
the new versions of boy , october and war are released on 21 july by island records .
steve lillywhite was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter mark savage .

it was originally going to be produced by joy division cohort martin hannett , but he dropped out after singer ian curtis committed suicide .
i always remember on that first album , i was sitting at the mixing desk with the band behind me and suddenly i heard all this giggling .
i turned around and suddenly they all went sheepish , shushing each other like teacher was looking at them .
i think they would admit that , like all teenage boys , they had n't lived long enough to acquire a personality … there was n't much talking in the studio .
it was quite serious .
we recorded in a place called windmill lane in dublin .
it was great for traditional irish music but no irish rock band had recorded there .
thin lizzy came to london to make their records .
the boomtown rats did n't record in ireland either .
the band said lillywhite was " like a children 's tv presenter " so the studio crew were very surprised when i decided i wanted to record the drums out in the hallway by the receptionist , as there was this wonderful clattery sound i wanted to get .

the building , to be called hafod eryri , was supposed to be completed this summer , but contractors now say they do not know when it will be finished .
in april workers had to dig snow off the railway track to get to work at the highest spot in wales or england .
snowdonia national park authority said since march 70 days ' work were lost to weather on the 3,560ft -lrb- 1,085m -rrb- peak .
however , the authority said progress on the scheme had been " remarkable " considering the conditions , including snow , heavy rain and winds regularly gusting over 80 mph . "
we have had to face problems and conditions on this scheme which are as unique as the location itself " meirion evans , regional director of construction company carillion it 's tough , and cold , at the top they also had to deal with poor weather last year , when at the peak period of summer 85 days of work were lost .
the interior of the building is almost complete and the granite walls are covering more of the metal structure , but the authority said it was impossible at present to confirm a completion date .
speaking at the construction site , aneurin phillips , chief executive of snowdonia national park authority said : " the granite walls need to be completed , the building will need to be commissioned and crucially the railway track at the summit needs to be re-laid , all of which will take time .
" however , the more i see of the work the more i am convinced that this will be a magnificent building for the summit of this beautiful and at times challenging mountain . "
the building , which is called hafod eryri , needs to be completed before the autumn deadline to draw on funds from europe .
the assembly government has supported the project and backing has also come from european objective one funds .
a public appeal also raised £ 350,000 .
refreshments and shelter hafod eryri will replace the demolished mountain cafe , which was once called britain 's highest slum by prince charles .
the old summit building was built in 1935 and designed by sir clough williams-ellis , the founder of the italianate village portmeirion a few miles away on the north wales coast .
the centre will have facilities giving visitors the chance to learn more about wales ' highest mountain and its environment .
it will also provide weather information , advice on routes as well as refreshments and shelter the building 's name was chosen after a secret ballot .
eryri means snowdonia in welsh , but there is no direct translation for hafod , an old welsh term for residence on high land .
meirion evans , regional director of construction company carillion , said : " we have had to face problems and conditions on this scheme which are as unique as the location itself .
" we have found solutions and worked extremely hard every moment the mountain and conditions will allow .
" i am aware that people will be disappointed at the delays which mean that plans can not be laid with certainty for opening hafod eryri to the public but we could never expect the mountain to give us free rein , " he added .
" we ask everyone to be patient while we work with the conditions and i know that we will deliver a building of which everyone can be proud " .
