the former germany keeper accepted a brief embrace from referee markus merk , who is also retiring , and modestly acknowledged the applause as he walked off .
he returned after the final whistle to receive the championship shield , his eighth german title at the end of a 21-year career .
" i could n't have asked for any more over the years , " kahn told reporters .
" i just feel grateful my body held out for so long , and i was able to celebrate so many great successes at a club like this . "
" i wanted to be the best " oliver kahn says he knew his destiny from childhood onwards and lived his life accordingly to become one of the most loved or hated figures in german and international football .
" it was my vision from early on : i wanted to be the best goalkeeper in the world .
the best goalkeeper in the world !
the best ! " he says in his upcoming book " i - success comes from within " of which excerpts are printed in the bild daily .
an asian swing with munich will see his last matches with the finale coming for good on may 27 in kolkata , india , against local club mohan bagun .
a testimonial match with munich against germany 's national team wraps up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , quits after 557 bundesliga games , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
revered by some , hated by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has had a love-hate relationship with fans kahn has been named everything from " titan " -lrb- in germany -rrb- and " king kahn " -lrb- fans in asia where he is immensely popular -rrb- to " son of a bitch " -lrb- angry spanish fans who he frustrated so many times in matches against real madrid , valencia or getafe -rrb- during his career spanning almost two decades .
he was pelted with bananas and a golf ball by irate german fans , left his pregnant wife for a new girlfriend and physically attacked players himself .
but everything he did and said in one way or another only underlined his unique dedication .
the bananas were thrown in reference to his almost gorilla-like stature from many hours spent in the gym and on the training field .
his motto is " never give up , " according to his profile on the bayern website .
his characteristics are listed there as " impatient , disciplined , ambitious . "
from karlsruhe to the world kahn 's career started at sc karlsruhe where he played his first bundesliga match in 1987 and was a regular starter from 1990 onwards .
he then left for munich in 1994 to become a legend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn gets up close and personal with miro klose the almost brutal attacks on dortmund 's heiko herrlich and stephane chapuisat , leverkusen 's thomas brdaric , or even a munich team-mate at the time in andreas herzog made plenty of headlines .
kahn names them " positive aggression , saying : " i often use my body language to show my team ' complete presence ' - and to instill respect , or even better fear , on the opponent .
others had a different view of these outbursts .
" he did n't bite me , but i was happy because this unique athlete had shown a weakness , " said herrlich of the 1999 incident .
regardless of his antics there is no debate that kahn was a superb goalkeeper who won or lost many memorable matches .
an icon in iconic games the 1999 champions league final which munich lost in the final minutes against manchester united .
the 2002 world cup final in yokohama , where the images of him sitting against the right post amid celebrating brazilians are a lasting memory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo scored two past kahn in the 2002 world cup final munich 's champions league triumph in 2001 , the remarkable bundesliga triumph a few days earlier that year from patrick andersson 's goal .
or even just a few weeks ago the uefa cup match in getafe where kahn raced into the penalty area in the last seconds of extra time and luca toni scored the deciding goal .
by then kahn 's image had already become far more positive , due to fewer outbursts and the wisdom of an elder football statesman .
then-coach rudi voeller named the 2002 world cup the turning point with kahn allowing just one goal in six matches to the final , and his error then making him " human after all . "
but kahn showed the biggest greatness in his darkest career hour , being downgraded to germany 's number two behind long-time foe jens lehmann by coach juergen klinsmann just ahead of the home world cup in 2006 .
the entire nation expected him to withdraw from the team , but instead kahn showed himself to be a devoted member of the squad and then even walked up to wish lehmann luck ahead of the penalty shootout with argentina .
respect from friends and foes alike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn showed his magnanimous side in 2006 " i heard what kahn said .
it was n't advice , it was encouragement .
this gesture impressed me immensely .
it was absolutely honest , absolute greatness ... i bow before this sporting spirit of oliver kahn , " said goalkeeper coach andreas koepke .
even arsenal 's lehmann had a fond message for kahn last saturday in zdf television .
" despite all our rivalry , i have got to say that your attitude has always impressed me immensely .
i could never lose the motivation to train hard because i knew there was somebody in munich who was training even harder or equally hard with the aim of being the best .

" i could n't have asked for any more over the years , " kahn told reporters .
" i just feel grateful my body held out for so long , and i was able to celebrate so many great successes at a club like this . "
" i wanted to be the best " oliver kahn says he knew his destiny from childhood onwards and lived his life accordingly to become one of the most loved or hated figures in german and international football .
" it was my vision from early on : i wanted to be the best goalkeeper in the world .
the best goalkeeper in the world !
the best ! " he says in his upcoming book " i - success comes from within " of which excerpts are printed in the bild daily .
an asian swing with munich will see his last matches with the finale coming for good on may 27 in kolkata , india , against local club mohan bagun .
a testimonial match with munich against germany 's national team wraps up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , quits after 557 bundesliga games , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
revered by some , hated by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has had a love-hate relationship with fans kahn has been named everything from " titan " -lrb- in germany -rrb- and " king kahn " -lrb- fans in asia where he is immensely popular -rrb- to " son of a bitch " -lrb- angry spanish fans who he frustrated so many times in matches against real madrid , valencia or getafe -rrb- during his career spanning almost two decades .
he was pelted with bananas and a golf ball by irate german fans , left his pregnant wife for a new girlfriend and physically attacked players himself .
but everything he did and said in one way or another only underlined his unique dedication .
the bananas were thrown in reference to his almost gorilla-like stature from many hours spent in the gym and on the training field .
his motto is " never give up , " according to his profile on the bayern website .
his characteristics are listed there as " impatient , disciplined , ambitious . "
from karlsruhe to the world kahn 's career started at sc karlsruhe where he played his first bundesliga match in 1987 and was a regular starter from 1990 onwards .
he then left for munich in 1994 to become a legend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn gets up close and personal with miro klose the almost brutal attacks on dortmund 's heiko herrlich and stephane chapuisat , leverkusen 's thomas brdaric , or even a munich team-mate at the time in andreas herzog made plenty of headlines .
kahn names them " positive aggression , saying : " i often use my body language to show my team ' complete presence ' - and to instill respect , or even better fear , on the opponent .
others had a different view of these outbursts .
" he did n't bite me , but i was happy because this unique athlete had shown a weakness , " said herrlich of the 1999 incident .
regardless of his antics there is no debate that kahn was a superb goalkeeper who won or lost many memorable matches .
an icon in iconic games the 1999 champions league final which munich lost in the final minutes against manchester united .
the 2002 world cup final in yokohama , where the images of him sitting against the right post amid celebrating brazilians are a lasting memory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo scored two past kahn in the 2002 world cup final munich 's champions league triumph in 2001 , the remarkable bundesliga triumph a few days earlier that year from patrick andersson 's goal .
or even just a few weeks ago the uefa cup match in getafe where kahn raced into the penalty area in the last seconds of extra time and luca toni scored the deciding goal .
by then kahn 's image had already become far more positive , due to fewer outbursts and the wisdom of an elder football statesman .
then-coach rudi voeller named the 2002 world cup the turning point with kahn allowing just one goal in six matches to the final , and his error then making him " human after all . "
but kahn showed the biggest greatness in his darkest career hour , being downgraded to germany 's number two behind long-time foe jens lehmann by coach juergen klinsmann just ahead of the home world cup in 2006 .
the entire nation expected him to withdraw from the team , but instead kahn showed himself to be a devoted member of the squad and then even walked up to wish lehmann luck ahead of the penalty shootout with argentina .
respect from friends and foes alike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn showed his magnanimous side in 2006 " i heard what kahn said .
it was n't advice , it was encouragement .
this gesture impressed me immensely .
it was absolutely honest , absolute greatness ... i bow before this sporting spirit of oliver kahn , " said goalkeeper coach andreas koepke .
even arsenal 's lehmann had a fond message for kahn last saturday in zdf television .
" despite all our rivalry , i have got to say that your attitude has always impressed me immensely .
i could never lose the motivation to train hard because i knew there was somebody in munich who was training even harder or equally hard with the aim of being the best .
" it helped me to improve and also deal with competition for a place at club level and i thank you for that and wish you all the best for the future , " said lehmann . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.05.2008 opinion : german economy powers ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy surged in the first quarter of this year , defying a global slowdown .
dw 's karl zawadzky remains optimistic about germany 's ability of maintaining its current financial boom . experts are predicting that economic growth will slip this year .
they cite the financial crisis , high oil and gas prices and the expensive euro . but the german economy is currently quite robust - perhaps even more robust than many experts think .
the surprisingly strong jump in economic activity during the first quarter is evidence of this .
while gross domestic product increased by only 0.3 percent in october , november and december , it rose by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2008 . that is an amazing increase that however should n't lead to hasty conclusions .
a closer look reveals the reasons for the unexpected growth , as well as the markers that will influence further developments . domestic markets get attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky for years , business activity has been fuelled by ever increasing export records .
but now , focus has shifted to domestic markets .
there were few impulses from abroad that spurred the german economy during the first quarter . the rising prices of key imports crude oil and gas , but also the expensive euro , which put the breaks on german exports , played a decisive role . while the trade surplus dropped dramatically , domestic investment rose .
this can be attributed to the fact that many companies are expanding their production capacity . tax write-off restrictions at the end of 2007 and the low snowfall during the winter are additional , perhaps even more crucial reasons behind the shift . many investment deals were not officially closed by the end of the year and had to be carried over into 2008 , which muddled the statistics . the mild weather meant that construction projects were n't interrupted .
compared to the first quarter of last year , the number of construction projects rose dramatically .
the unusually mild winter thus effectively oversubscribed the economic growth statistics , which means that a drop in the second quarter can only be expected . little reason for pessimism but the german economy is still on track for growth .
even in the first quarter , personal consumption rose after many weak years .
employment was up 1.8 percent compared to spring 2007 and the rise in wages in some sectors promises the biggest increase in buying power in years .
that will boost consumption .
the german economy is powering ahead , propelled by its own strength . the indicators suggest that the german government is on the safe side with its growth prediction of 1.7 percent .
some economic experts are already speaking of 2 percent or more . the good news is that inflation will drop .
it already sank from 3.1 percent in march to 2.4 percent in april . compared to other countries in the eu , germany is proving to be the bloc 's economic engine and is powering through the current financial crisis quite well .
while the german economy grew by 1.5 percent in the first quarter , the eu reported an average growth rate of only 0.7 percent . however , the recession in eu partner countries represents yet another danger to germany 's export-dependent economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky remains optimistic about germany 's ability of maintaining its current financial boom . experts are predicting that economic growth will slip this year .
they cite the financial crisis , high oil and gas prices and the expensive euro . but the german economy is currently quite robust - perhaps even more robust than many experts think .
the surprisingly strong jump in economic activity during the first quarter is evidence of this .
while gross domestic product increased by only 0.3 percent in october , november and december , it rose by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2008 . that is an amazing increase that however should n't lead to hasty conclusions .
a closer look reveals the reasons for the unexpected growth , as well as the markers that will influence further developments . domestic markets get attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky for years , business activity has been fuelled by ever increasing export records .
but now , focus has shifted to domestic markets .
there were few impulses from abroad that spurred the german economy during the first quarter . the rising prices of key imports crude oil and gas , but also the expensive euro , which put the breaks on german exports , played a decisive role . while the trade surplus dropped dramatically , domestic investment rose .
this can be attributed to the fact that many companies are expanding their production capacity . tax write-off restrictions at the end of 2007 and the low snowfall during the winter are additional , perhaps even more crucial reasons behind the shift . many investment deals were not officially closed by the end of the year and had to be carried over into 2008 , which muddled the statistics . the mild weather meant that construction projects were n't interrupted .
compared to the first quarter of last year , the number of construction projects rose dramatically .
the unusually mild winter thus effectively oversubscribed the economic growth statistics , which means that a drop in the second quarter can only be expected . little reason for pessimism but the german economy is still on track for growth .
even in the first quarter , personal consumption rose after many weak years .
employment was up 1.8 percent compared to spring 2007 and the rise in wages in some sectors promises the biggest increase in buying power in years .
that will boost consumption .
the german economy is powering ahead , propelled by its own strength . the indicators suggest that the german government is on the safe side with its growth prediction of 1.7 percent .
some economic experts are already speaking of 2 percent or more . the good news is that inflation will drop .
it already sank from 3.1 percent in march to 2.4 percent in april . compared to other countries in the eu , germany is proving to be the bloc 's economic engine and is powering through the current financial crisis quite well .

dw 's karl zawadzky remains optimistic about germany 's ability of maintaining its current financial boom . experts are predicting that economic growth will slip this year .
they cite the financial crisis , high oil and gas prices and the expensive euro . but the german economy is currently quite robust - perhaps even more robust than many experts think .
the surprisingly strong jump in economic activity during the first quarter is evidence of this .
while gross domestic product increased by only 0.3 percent in october , november and december , it rose by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2008 . that is an amazing increase that however should n't lead to hasty conclusions .
a closer look reveals the reasons for the unexpected growth , as well as the markers that will influence further developments . domestic markets get attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky for years , business activity has been fuelled by ever increasing export records .
but now , focus has shifted to domestic markets .
there were few impulses from abroad that spurred the german economy during the first quarter . the rising prices of key imports crude oil and gas , but also the expensive euro , which put the breaks on german exports , played a decisive role . while the trade surplus dropped dramatically , domestic investment rose .
this can be attributed to the fact that many companies are expanding their production capacity . tax write-off restrictions at the end of 2007 and the low snowfall during the winter are additional , perhaps even more crucial reasons behind the shift . many investment deals were not officially closed by the end of the year and had to be carried over into 2008 , which muddled the statistics . the mild weather meant that construction projects were n't interrupted .
compared to the first quarter of last year , the number of construction projects rose dramatically .
the unusually mild winter thus effectively oversubscribed the economic growth statistics , which means that a drop in the second quarter can only be expected . little reason for pessimism but the german economy is still on track for growth .
even in the first quarter , personal consumption rose after many weak years .
employment was up 1.8 percent compared to spring 2007 and the rise in wages in some sectors promises the biggest increase in buying power in years .
that will boost consumption .
the german economy is powering ahead , propelled by its own strength . the indicators suggest that the german government is on the safe side with its growth prediction of 1.7 percent .
some economic experts are already speaking of 2 percent or more . the good news is that inflation will drop .
it already sank from 3.1 percent in march to 2.4 percent in april . compared to other countries in the eu , germany is proving to be the bloc 's economic engine and is powering through the current financial crisis quite well .
while the german economy grew by 1.5 percent in the first quarter , the eu reported an average growth rate of only 0.7 percent . however , the recession in eu partner countries represents yet another danger to germany 's export-dependent economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" together with the marshall plan and the millions of care packages the unique efforts of the berlin airlift laid the basis for the enduring friendship between germans and americans , " germany 's ambassador to the united states , klaus scharioth said .
the blue angels air acrobats wrote the words " friends always " in the sky over andrews air force base outside washington where the festivities took place .
the berlin airlift was the largest campaign to transport food and goods into the area blockaded by the soviet union .
from june 26 , 1948 to may 12 , 1949 some 2.5 million people were supplied exclusively by air after the soviets attempted to force the western powers out of west berlin blocking all land routes into the territory located more than 100 kilometers deep inside eastern germany .
the us air force this year remembered the 60th anniversary by dedicating its annual air show , which tens of thousands of people visit each year , to the event .
the high point of this year 's celebration was the participation of " candy bombers " - the nickname given to the american planes because they would drop candies to berlin 's youngsters as they flew in to deliver aid to the city . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said both chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their junior coalition partner , the social democrats , had agreed to clamp down on forced prostitution .
regular prostitution is legal in germany , with cities zoning land for brothels .
prostitutes appear on tv and pay income tax .
but authorities are concerned that some women , typically illegal immigrants from poor nations in eastern europe , are employed against their will by pimps who demand repayment of vast " recruitment fees . "
some say law too weak the new rules would make it a crime for a man to commit sexual abuse " in a situation where the victim is helpless . "
currently it is not a crime to buy the services of a prostitute in germany .
der spiegel said lawyers in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- considered the draft too weak because a customer could avoid prosecution by claiming ignorance about the fact that the prostitute was forced into the profession .
legislator siegfried kauder said the sexual act should be considered a crime if a customer carelessly ignored evidence of duress , such as bruises on a woman .
the justice ministry spokesman said there were plans to pass the legislation before the autumn 2009 general election . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.05.2008 star goalie king kahn retires großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retiring ... but certainly not shy : oliver kahn will not go quietly into his retirement legendary bayern munich and germany goalkeeper oliver kahn , who retires this weekend after a distinguished career between the posts , was given a perfect send-off by bayern by beating hertha berlin 4-1 . champions bayern munich sent off kahn in style on saturday , may 17 , with a neat demolition of hertha berlin thanks to a hat-trick from luca toni and one goal from franck ribery , their two outstanding players this season .
the former germany keeper accepted a brief embrace from referee markus merk , who is also retiring , and modestly acknowledged the applause as he walked off .
he returned after the final whistle to receive the championship shield , his eighth german title at the end of a 21-year career .
" i could n't have asked for any more over the years , " kahn told reporters .
" i just feel grateful my body held out for so long , and i was able to celebrate so many great successes at a club like this . "
" i wanted to be the best " oliver kahn says he knew his destiny from childhood onwards and lived his life accordingly to become one of the most loved or hated figures in german and international football .
" it was my vision from early on : i wanted to be the best goalkeeper in the world .
the best goalkeeper in the world !
the best ! " he says in his upcoming book " i - success comes from within " of which excerpts are printed in the bild daily .
an asian swing with munich will see his last matches with the finale coming for good on may 27 in kolkata , india , against local club mohan bagun .
a testimonial match with munich against germany 's national team wraps up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , quits after 557 bundesliga games , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
revered by some , hated by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has had a love-hate relationship with fans kahn has been named everything from " titan " -lrb- in germany -rrb- and " king kahn " -lrb- fans in asia where he is immensely popular -rrb- to " son of a bitch " -lrb- angry spanish fans who he frustrated so many times in matches against real madrid , valencia or getafe -rrb- during his career spanning almost two decades .
he was pelted with bananas and a golf ball by irate german fans , left his pregnant wife for a new girlfriend and physically attacked players himself .
but everything he did and said in one way or another only underlined his unique dedication .
the bananas were thrown in reference to his almost gorilla-like stature from many hours spent in the gym and on the training field .
his motto is " never give up , " according to his profile on the bayern website .
his characteristics are listed there as " impatient , disciplined , ambitious . "
from karlsruhe to the world kahn 's career started at sc karlsruhe where he played his first bundesliga match in 1987 and was a regular starter from 1990 onwards .
he then left for munich in 1994 to become a legend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn gets up close and personal with miro klose the almost brutal attacks on dortmund 's heiko herrlich and stephane chapuisat , leverkusen 's thomas brdaric , or even a munich team-mate at the time in andreas herzog made plenty of headlines .
kahn names them " positive aggression , saying : " i often use my body language to show my team ' complete presence ' - and to instill respect , or even better fear , on the opponent .
others had a different view of these outbursts .
" he did n't bite me , but i was happy because this unique athlete had shown a weakness , " said herrlich of the 1999 incident .
regardless of his antics there is no debate that kahn was a superb goalkeeper who won or lost many memorable matches .
an icon in iconic games the 1999 champions league final which munich lost in the final minutes against manchester united .
the 2002 world cup final in yokohama , where the images of him sitting against the right post amid celebrating brazilians are a lasting memory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo scored two past kahn in the 2002 world cup final munich 's champions league triumph in 2001 , the remarkable bundesliga triumph a few days earlier that year from patrick andersson 's goal .
or even just a few weeks ago the uefa cup match in getafe where kahn raced into the penalty area in the last seconds of extra time and luca toni scored the deciding goal .
by then kahn 's image had already become far more positive , due to fewer outbursts and the wisdom of an elder football statesman .
then-coach rudi voeller named the 2002 world cup the turning point with kahn allowing just one goal in six matches to the final , and his error then making him " human after all . "
but kahn showed the biggest greatness in his darkest career hour , being downgraded to germany 's number two behind long-time foe jens lehmann by coach juergen klinsmann just ahead of the home world cup in 2006 .
the entire nation expected him to withdraw from the team , but instead kahn showed himself to be a devoted member of the squad and then even walked up to wish lehmann luck ahead of the penalty shootout with argentina .
respect from friends and foes alike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn showed his magnanimous side in 2006 " i heard what kahn said .
it was n't advice , it was encouragement .
this gesture impressed me immensely .
it was absolutely honest , absolute greatness ... i bow before this sporting spirit of oliver kahn , " said goalkeeper coach andreas koepke .
even arsenal 's lehmann had a fond message for kahn last saturday in zdf television .
" despite all our rivalry , i have got to say that your attitude has always impressed me immensely .
i could never lose the motivation to train hard because i knew there was somebody in munich who was training even harder or equally hard with the aim of being the best .
" it helped me to improve and also deal with competition for a place at club level and i thank you for that and wish you all the best for the future , " said lehmann . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former germany keeper accepted a brief embrace from referee markus merk , who is also retiring , and modestly acknowledged the applause as he walked off .
he returned after the final whistle to receive the championship shield , his eighth german title at the end of a 21-year career .
" i could n't have asked for any more over the years , " kahn told reporters .
" i just feel grateful my body held out for so long , and i was able to celebrate so many great successes at a club like this . "
" i wanted to be the best " oliver kahn says he knew his destiny from childhood onwards and lived his life accordingly to become one of the most loved or hated figures in german and international football .
" it was my vision from early on : i wanted to be the best goalkeeper in the world .
the best goalkeeper in the world !
the best ! " he says in his upcoming book " i - success comes from within " of which excerpts are printed in the bild daily .
an asian swing with munich will see his last matches with the finale coming for good on may 27 in kolkata , india , against local club mohan bagun .
a testimonial match with munich against germany 's national team wraps up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , quits after 557 bundesliga games , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
revered by some , hated by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has had a love-hate relationship with fans kahn has been named everything from " titan " -lrb- in germany -rrb- and " king kahn " -lrb- fans in asia where he is immensely popular -rrb- to " son of a bitch " -lrb- angry spanish fans who he frustrated so many times in matches against real madrid , valencia or getafe -rrb- during his career spanning almost two decades .
he was pelted with bananas and a golf ball by irate german fans , left his pregnant wife for a new girlfriend and physically attacked players himself .
but everything he did and said in one way or another only underlined his unique dedication .
the bananas were thrown in reference to his almost gorilla-like stature from many hours spent in the gym and on the training field .
his motto is " never give up , " according to his profile on the bayern website .
his characteristics are listed there as " impatient , disciplined , ambitious . "
from karlsruhe to the world kahn 's career started at sc karlsruhe where he played his first bundesliga match in 1987 and was a regular starter from 1990 onwards .
he then left for munich in 1994 to become a legend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn gets up close and personal with miro klose the almost brutal attacks on dortmund 's heiko herrlich and stephane chapuisat , leverkusen 's thomas brdaric , or even a munich team-mate at the time in andreas herzog made plenty of headlines .
kahn names them " positive aggression , saying : " i often use my body language to show my team ' complete presence ' - and to instill respect , or even better fear , on the opponent .
others had a different view of these outbursts .
" he did n't bite me , but i was happy because this unique athlete had shown a weakness , " said herrlich of the 1999 incident .
regardless of his antics there is no debate that kahn was a superb goalkeeper who won or lost many memorable matches .
an icon in iconic games the 1999 champions league final which munich lost in the final minutes against manchester united .
the 2002 world cup final in yokohama , where the images of him sitting against the right post amid celebrating brazilians are a lasting memory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo scored two past kahn in the 2002 world cup final munich 's champions league triumph in 2001 , the remarkable bundesliga triumph a few days earlier that year from patrick andersson 's goal .
or even just a few weeks ago the uefa cup match in getafe where kahn raced into the penalty area in the last seconds of extra time and luca toni scored the deciding goal .
by then kahn 's image had already become far more positive , due to fewer outbursts and the wisdom of an elder football statesman .
then-coach rudi voeller named the 2002 world cup the turning point with kahn allowing just one goal in six matches to the final , and his error then making him " human after all . "
but kahn showed the biggest greatness in his darkest career hour , being downgraded to germany 's number two behind long-time foe jens lehmann by coach juergen klinsmann just ahead of the home world cup in 2006 .
the entire nation expected him to withdraw from the team , but instead kahn showed himself to be a devoted member of the squad and then even walked up to wish lehmann luck ahead of the penalty shootout with argentina .
respect from friends and foes alike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn showed his magnanimous side in 2006 " i heard what kahn said .
it was n't advice , it was encouragement .
this gesture impressed me immensely .
it was absolutely honest , absolute greatness ... i bow before this sporting spirit of oliver kahn , " said goalkeeper coach andreas koepke .
even arsenal 's lehmann had a fond message for kahn last saturday in zdf television .
" despite all our rivalry , i have got to say that your attitude has always impressed me immensely .
i could never lose the motivation to train hard because i knew there was somebody in munich who was training even harder or equally hard with the aim of being the best .

the former germany keeper accepted a brief embrace from referee markus merk , who is also retiring , and modestly acknowledged the applause as he walked off .
he returned after the final whistle to receive the championship shield , his eighth german title at the end of a 21-year career .
" i could n't have asked for any more over the years , " kahn told reporters .
" i just feel grateful my body held out for so long , and i was able to celebrate so many great successes at a club like this . "
" i wanted to be the best " oliver kahn says he knew his destiny from childhood onwards and lived his life accordingly to become one of the most loved or hated figures in german and international football .
" it was my vision from early on : i wanted to be the best goalkeeper in the world .
the best goalkeeper in the world !
the best ! " he says in his upcoming book " i - success comes from within " of which excerpts are printed in the bild daily .
an asian swing with munich will see his last matches with the finale coming for good on may 27 in kolkata , india , against local club mohan bagun .
a testimonial match with munich against germany 's national team wraps up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , quits after 557 bundesliga games , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
revered by some , hated by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has had a love-hate relationship with fans kahn has been named everything from " titan " -lrb- in germany -rrb- and " king kahn " -lrb- fans in asia where he is immensely popular -rrb- to " son of a bitch " -lrb- angry spanish fans who he frustrated so many times in matches against real madrid , valencia or getafe -rrb- during his career spanning almost two decades .
he was pelted with bananas and a golf ball by irate german fans , left his pregnant wife for a new girlfriend and physically attacked players himself .
but everything he did and said in one way or another only underlined his unique dedication .
the bananas were thrown in reference to his almost gorilla-like stature from many hours spent in the gym and on the training field .
his motto is " never give up , " according to his profile on the bayern website .
his characteristics are listed there as " impatient , disciplined , ambitious . "
from karlsruhe to the world kahn 's career started at sc karlsruhe where he played his first bundesliga match in 1987 and was a regular starter from 1990 onwards .
he then left for munich in 1994 to become a legend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn gets up close and personal with miro klose the almost brutal attacks on dortmund 's heiko herrlich and stephane chapuisat , leverkusen 's thomas brdaric , or even a munich team-mate at the time in andreas herzog made plenty of headlines .
kahn names them " positive aggression , saying : " i often use my body language to show my team ' complete presence ' - and to instill respect , or even better fear , on the opponent .
others had a different view of these outbursts .
" he did n't bite me , but i was happy because this unique athlete had shown a weakness , " said herrlich of the 1999 incident .
regardless of his antics there is no debate that kahn was a superb goalkeeper who won or lost many memorable matches .
an icon in iconic games the 1999 champions league final which munich lost in the final minutes against manchester united .
the 2002 world cup final in yokohama , where the images of him sitting against the right post amid celebrating brazilians are a lasting memory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo scored two past kahn in the 2002 world cup final munich 's champions league triumph in 2001 , the remarkable bundesliga triumph a few days earlier that year from patrick andersson 's goal .
or even just a few weeks ago the uefa cup match in getafe where kahn raced into the penalty area in the last seconds of extra time and luca toni scored the deciding goal .
by then kahn 's image had already become far more positive , due to fewer outbursts and the wisdom of an elder football statesman .
then-coach rudi voeller named the 2002 world cup the turning point with kahn allowing just one goal in six matches to the final , and his error then making him " human after all . "
but kahn showed the biggest greatness in his darkest career hour , being downgraded to germany 's number two behind long-time foe jens lehmann by coach juergen klinsmann just ahead of the home world cup in 2006 .
the entire nation expected him to withdraw from the team , but instead kahn showed himself to be a devoted member of the squad and then even walked up to wish lehmann luck ahead of the penalty shootout with argentina .
respect from friends and foes alike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn showed his magnanimous side in 2006 " i heard what kahn said .
it was n't advice , it was encouragement .
this gesture impressed me immensely .
it was absolutely honest , absolute greatness ... i bow before this sporting spirit of oliver kahn , " said goalkeeper coach andreas koepke .
even arsenal 's lehmann had a fond message for kahn last saturday in zdf television .
" despite all our rivalry , i have got to say that your attitude has always impressed me immensely .
i could never lose the motivation to train hard because i knew there was somebody in munich who was training even harder or equally hard with the aim of being the best .
" it helped me to improve and also deal with competition for a place at club level and i thank you for that and wish you all the best for the future , " said lehmann . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assembly of the manufactured parts of the four-door panamera model will generate a further 600 employment opportunities across europe .
porsche 's partner car manufacturer volkswagen will also benefit from the new model , berning said .
" 500 employees will be involved in bodywork production and spraying of the cars at volkswagen 's hanover plant , " he said .
" we do n't chase volume " porsche plans to produce 20,000 cars in 2010 , the first full year of production .
berning said the number could be increased depending on demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both volkswagen and porsche are set to benefit from the new model " just like other car manufacturers , we have a very flexible production goal , we have to see how the market responds . "
berning told auto motor und sport magazine .
berning said porsche had no plans to manufacture in the united states and he rejected speculation that luxury-oriented porsche might add a small sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- to its range .
" we do n't chase volume .
we aim to make money with every single car .
the bigger a market segment is , the harder that becomes , " he said .
" so the small suv is definitely not the way porsche will be going . "
vw revs up us plans meanwhile , german news magazine der spiegel reported saturday that volkswagen is going ahead with plans to set up a us car plant to make 250,000 cars a year .
the magazine said the site would in 2010 begin manufacturing a car that was at least $ 3,000 cheaper than volkswagen 's current family sedan .
andreas meurer , a volkswagen spokesman told german news agency dpa the site would make a " passat-sized car specially developed for the us market , " but no name had been chosen for the model yet .
savings would be achieved by downgrading features such as the elaborate live axle used in the passat .
he said a final decision would be made by the volkswagen supervisory board in july .
three us states were in the running to host the plant : alabama , tennessee and michigan .
like other german manufacturers , volkswagen has been hit hard by the fall in the dollar , making imported products very expensive in the united states . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assembly of the manufactured parts of the four-door panamera model will generate a further 600 employment opportunities across europe .
porsche 's partner car manufacturer volkswagen will also benefit from the new model , berning said .
" 500 employees will be involved in bodywork production and spraying of the cars at volkswagen 's hanover plant , " he said .
" we do n't chase volume " porsche plans to produce 20,000 cars in 2010 , the first full year of production .
berning said the number could be increased depending on demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both volkswagen and porsche are set to benefit from the new model " just like other car manufacturers , we have a very flexible production goal , we have to see how the market responds . "
berning told auto motor und sport magazine .
berning said porsche had no plans to manufacture in the united states and he rejected speculation that luxury-oriented porsche might add a small sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- to its range .
" we do n't chase volume .
we aim to make money with every single car .
the bigger a market segment is , the harder that becomes , " he said .
" so the small suv is definitely not the way porsche will be going . "
vw revs up us plans meanwhile , german news magazine der spiegel reported saturday that volkswagen is going ahead with plans to set up a us car plant to make 250,000 cars a year .
the magazine said the site would in 2010 begin manufacturing a car that was at least $ 3,000 cheaper than volkswagen 's current family sedan .
andreas meurer , a volkswagen spokesman told german news agency dpa the site would make a " passat-sized car specially developed for the us market , " but no name had been chosen for the model yet .
savings would be achieved by downgrading features such as the elaborate live axle used in the passat .
he said a final decision would be made by the volkswagen supervisory board in july .

the loss of swarms has worsened a long-term collapse in bee populations in many parts of the world that is blamed on the varroa mite infesting hives .
the research institute said late friday 29 out of 30 dead bees it had checked had been killed by contact with the pesticide , which is harmless to humans but lethal to fruit flies and the corn rootworm -lrb- scientific name diabrotica virgifera -rrb- .
farmers in bavaria and baden-wuerttemberg used massive amounts of the pesticide this year in an effort to counter pests .
the institute said it may have blown onto wild plants , fruit trees and rapeseed crops as it was sprayed .

the loss of swarms has worsened a long-term collapse in bee populations in many parts of the world that is blamed on the varroa mite infesting hives .
the research institute said late friday 29 out of 30 dead bees it had checked had been killed by contact with the pesticide , which is harmless to humans but lethal to fruit flies and the corn rootworm -lrb- scientific name diabrotica virgifera -rrb- .
farmers in bavaria and baden-wuerttemberg used massive amounts of the pesticide this year in an effort to counter pests .

he said both chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their junior coalition partner , the social democrats , had agreed to clamp down on forced prostitution .
regular prostitution is legal in germany , with cities zoning land for brothels .
prostitutes appear on tv and pay income tax .
but authorities are concerned that some women , typically illegal immigrants from poor nations in eastern europe , are employed against their will by pimps who demand repayment of vast " recruitment fees . "
some say law too weak the new rules would make it a crime for a man to commit sexual abuse " in a situation where the victim is helpless . "
currently it is not a crime to buy the services of a prostitute in germany .
der spiegel said lawyers in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- considered the draft too weak because a customer could avoid prosecution by claiming ignorance about the fact that the prostitute was forced into the profession .
legislator siegfried kauder said the sexual act should be considered a crime if a customer carelessly ignored evidence of duress , such as bruises on a woman .
the justice ministry spokesman said there were plans to pass the legislation before the autumn 2009 general election . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky remains optimistic about germany 's ability of maintaining its current financial boom . experts are predicting that economic growth will slip this year .
they cite the financial crisis , high oil and gas prices and the expensive euro . but the german economy is currently quite robust - perhaps even more robust than many experts think .
the surprisingly strong jump in economic activity during the first quarter is evidence of this .
while gross domestic product increased by only 0.3 percent in october , november and december , it rose by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2008 . that is an amazing increase that however should n't lead to hasty conclusions .
a closer look reveals the reasons for the unexpected growth , as well as the markers that will influence further developments . domestic markets get attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky for years , business activity has been fuelled by ever increasing export records .
but now , focus has shifted to domestic markets .
there were few impulses from abroad that spurred the german economy during the first quarter . the rising prices of key imports crude oil and gas , but also the expensive euro , which put the breaks on german exports , played a decisive role . while the trade surplus dropped dramatically , domestic investment rose .
this can be attributed to the fact that many companies are expanding their production capacity . tax write-off restrictions at the end of 2007 and the low snowfall during the winter are additional , perhaps even more crucial reasons behind the shift . many investment deals were not officially closed by the end of the year and had to be carried over into 2008 , which muddled the statistics . the mild weather meant that construction projects were n't interrupted .
compared to the first quarter of last year , the number of construction projects rose dramatically .
the unusually mild winter thus effectively oversubscribed the economic growth statistics , which means that a drop in the second quarter can only be expected . little reason for pessimism but the german economy is still on track for growth .
even in the first quarter , personal consumption rose after many weak years .
employment was up 1.8 percent compared to spring 2007 and the rise in wages in some sectors promises the biggest increase in buying power in years .
that will boost consumption .
the german economy is powering ahead , propelled by its own strength . the indicators suggest that the german government is on the safe side with its growth prediction of 1.7 percent .
some economic experts are already speaking of 2 percent or more . the good news is that inflation will drop .
it already sank from 3.1 percent in march to 2.4 percent in april . compared to other countries in the eu , germany is proving to be the bloc 's economic engine and is powering through the current financial crisis quite well .
while the german economy grew by 1.5 percent in the first quarter , the eu reported an average growth rate of only 0.7 percent . however , the recession in eu partner countries represents yet another danger to germany 's export-dependent economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assembly of the manufactured parts of the four-door panamera model will generate a further 600 employment opportunities across europe .
porsche 's partner car manufacturer volkswagen will also benefit from the new model , berning said .
" 500 employees will be involved in bodywork production and spraying of the cars at volkswagen 's hanover plant , " he said .

he said a final decision would be made by the volkswagen supervisory board in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.05.2008 opinion : german economy powers ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy surged in the first quarter of this year , defying a global slowdown .
dw 's karl zawadzky remains optimistic about germany 's ability of maintaining its current financial boom . experts are predicting that economic growth will slip this year .
they cite the financial crisis , high oil and gas prices and the expensive euro . but the german economy is currently quite robust - perhaps even more robust than many experts think .
the surprisingly strong jump in economic activity during the first quarter is evidence of this .
while gross domestic product increased by only 0.3 percent in october , november and december , it rose by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2008 . that is an amazing increase that however should n't lead to hasty conclusions .
a closer look reveals the reasons for the unexpected growth , as well as the markers that will influence further developments . domestic markets get attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky for years , business activity has been fuelled by ever increasing export records .
but now , focus has shifted to domestic markets .
there were few impulses from abroad that spurred the german economy during the first quarter . the rising prices of key imports crude oil and gas , but also the expensive euro , which put the breaks on german exports , played a decisive role . while the trade surplus dropped dramatically , domestic investment rose .
this can be attributed to the fact that many companies are expanding their production capacity . tax write-off restrictions at the end of 2007 and the low snowfall during the winter are additional , perhaps even more crucial reasons behind the shift . many investment deals were not officially closed by the end of the year and had to be carried over into 2008 , which muddled the statistics . the mild weather meant that construction projects were n't interrupted .
compared to the first quarter of last year , the number of construction projects rose dramatically .
the unusually mild winter thus effectively oversubscribed the economic growth statistics , which means that a drop in the second quarter can only be expected . little reason for pessimism but the german economy is still on track for growth .
even in the first quarter , personal consumption rose after many weak years .
employment was up 1.8 percent compared to spring 2007 and the rise in wages in some sectors promises the biggest increase in buying power in years .
that will boost consumption .
the german economy is powering ahead , propelled by its own strength . the indicators suggest that the german government is on the safe side with its growth prediction of 1.7 percent .
some economic experts are already speaking of 2 percent or more . the good news is that inflation will drop .
it already sank from 3.1 percent in march to 2.4 percent in april . compared to other countries in the eu , germany is proving to be the bloc 's economic engine and is powering through the current financial crisis quite well .
while the german economy grew by 1.5 percent in the first quarter , the eu reported an average growth rate of only 0.7 percent . however , the recession in eu partner countries represents yet another danger to germany 's export-dependent economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky remains optimistic about germany 's ability of maintaining its current financial boom . experts are predicting that economic growth will slip this year .
they cite the financial crisis , high oil and gas prices and the expensive euro . but the german economy is currently quite robust - perhaps even more robust than many experts think .
the surprisingly strong jump in economic activity during the first quarter is evidence of this .
while gross domestic product increased by only 0.3 percent in october , november and december , it rose by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2008 . that is an amazing increase that however should n't lead to hasty conclusions .
a closer look reveals the reasons for the unexpected growth , as well as the markers that will influence further developments . domestic markets get attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky for years , business activity has been fuelled by ever increasing export records .
but now , focus has shifted to domestic markets .
there were few impulses from abroad that spurred the german economy during the first quarter . the rising prices of key imports crude oil and gas , but also the expensive euro , which put the breaks on german exports , played a decisive role . while the trade surplus dropped dramatically , domestic investment rose .

dw 's karl zawadzky remains optimistic about germany 's ability of maintaining its current financial boom . experts are predicting that economic growth will slip this year .
they cite the financial crisis , high oil and gas prices and the expensive euro . but the german economy is currently quite robust - perhaps even more robust than many experts think .
the surprisingly strong jump in economic activity during the first quarter is evidence of this .
while gross domestic product increased by only 0.3 percent in october , november and december , it rose by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2008 . that is an amazing increase that however should n't lead to hasty conclusions .
a closer look reveals the reasons for the unexpected growth , as well as the markers that will influence further developments . domestic markets get attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky for years , business activity has been fuelled by ever increasing export records .
but now , focus has shifted to domestic markets .
there were few impulses from abroad that spurred the german economy during the first quarter . the rising prices of key imports crude oil and gas , but also the expensive euro , which put the breaks on german exports , played a decisive role . while the trade surplus dropped dramatically , domestic investment rose .
this can be attributed to the fact that many companies are expanding their production capacity . tax write-off restrictions at the end of 2007 and the low snowfall during the winter are additional , perhaps even more crucial reasons behind the shift . many investment deals were not officially closed by the end of the year and had to be carried over into 2008 , which muddled the statistics . the mild weather meant that construction projects were n't interrupted .
compared to the first quarter of last year , the number of construction projects rose dramatically .
the unusually mild winter thus effectively oversubscribed the economic growth statistics , which means that a drop in the second quarter can only be expected . little reason for pessimism but the german economy is still on track for growth .
even in the first quarter , personal consumption rose after many weak years .
employment was up 1.8 percent compared to spring 2007 and the rise in wages in some sectors promises the biggest increase in buying power in years .
that will boost consumption .
the german economy is powering ahead , propelled by its own strength . the indicators suggest that the german government is on the safe side with its growth prediction of 1.7 percent .
some economic experts are already speaking of 2 percent or more . the good news is that inflation will drop .
it already sank from 3.1 percent in march to 2.4 percent in april . compared to other countries in the eu , germany is proving to be the bloc 's economic engine and is powering through the current financial crisis quite well .

dw 's karl zawadzky remains optimistic about germany 's ability of maintaining its current financial boom . experts are predicting that economic growth will slip this year .
they cite the financial crisis , high oil and gas prices and the expensive euro . but the german economy is currently quite robust - perhaps even more robust than many experts think .
the surprisingly strong jump in economic activity during the first quarter is evidence of this .
while gross domestic product increased by only 0.3 percent in october , november and december , it rose by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2008 . that is an amazing increase that however should n't lead to hasty conclusions .
a closer look reveals the reasons for the unexpected growth , as well as the markers that will influence further developments . domestic markets get attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky for years , business activity has been fuelled by ever increasing export records .
but now , focus has shifted to domestic markets .
there were few impulses from abroad that spurred the german economy during the first quarter . the rising prices of key imports crude oil and gas , but also the expensive euro , which put the breaks on german exports , played a decisive role . while the trade surplus dropped dramatically , domestic investment rose .
this can be attributed to the fact that many companies are expanding their production capacity . tax write-off restrictions at the end of 2007 and the low snowfall during the winter are additional , perhaps even more crucial reasons behind the shift . many investment deals were not officially closed by the end of the year and had to be carried over into 2008 , which muddled the statistics . the mild weather meant that construction projects were n't interrupted .
compared to the first quarter of last year , the number of construction projects rose dramatically .
the unusually mild winter thus effectively oversubscribed the economic growth statistics , which means that a drop in the second quarter can only be expected . little reason for pessimism but the german economy is still on track for growth .
even in the first quarter , personal consumption rose after many weak years .
employment was up 1.8 percent compared to spring 2007 and the rise in wages in some sectors promises the biggest increase in buying power in years .
that will boost consumption .
the german economy is powering ahead , propelled by its own strength . the indicators suggest that the german government is on the safe side with its growth prediction of 1.7 percent .
some economic experts are already speaking of 2 percent or more . the good news is that inflation will drop .
it already sank from 3.1 percent in march to 2.4 percent in april . compared to other countries in the eu , germany is proving to be the bloc 's economic engine and is powering through the current financial crisis quite well .
while the german economy grew by 1.5 percent in the first quarter , the eu reported an average growth rate of only 0.7 percent . however , the recession in eu partner countries represents yet another danger to germany 's export-dependent economy . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former germany keeper accepted a brief embrace from referee markus merk , who is also retiring , and modestly acknowledged the applause as he walked off .
he returned after the final whistle to receive the championship shield , his eighth german title at the end of a 21-year career .
" i could n't have asked for any more over the years , " kahn told reporters .
" i just feel grateful my body held out for so long , and i was able to celebrate so many great successes at a club like this . "
" i wanted to be the best " oliver kahn says he knew his destiny from childhood onwards and lived his life accordingly to become one of the most loved or hated figures in german and international football .
" it was my vision from early on : i wanted to be the best goalkeeper in the world .
the best goalkeeper in the world !
the best ! " he says in his upcoming book " i - success comes from within " of which excerpts are printed in the bild daily .
an asian swing with munich will see his last matches with the finale coming for good on may 27 in kolkata , india , against local club mohan bagun .
a testimonial match with munich against germany 's national team wraps up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , quits after 557 bundesliga games , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
revered by some , hated by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has had a love-hate relationship with fans kahn has been named everything from " titan " -lrb- in germany -rrb- and " king kahn " -lrb- fans in asia where he is immensely popular -rrb- to " son of a bitch " -lrb- angry spanish fans who he frustrated so many times in matches against real madrid , valencia or getafe -rrb- during his career spanning almost two decades .
he was pelted with bananas and a golf ball by irate german fans , left his pregnant wife for a new girlfriend and physically attacked players himself .
but everything he did and said in one way or another only underlined his unique dedication .
the bananas were thrown in reference to his almost gorilla-like stature from many hours spent in the gym and on the training field .
his motto is " never give up , " according to his profile on the bayern website .
his characteristics are listed there as " impatient , disciplined , ambitious . "
from karlsruhe to the world kahn 's career started at sc karlsruhe where he played his first bundesliga match in 1987 and was a regular starter from 1990 onwards .
he then left for munich in 1994 to become a legend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn gets up close and personal with miro klose the almost brutal attacks on dortmund 's heiko herrlich and stephane chapuisat , leverkusen 's thomas brdaric , or even a munich team-mate at the time in andreas herzog made plenty of headlines .
kahn names them " positive aggression , saying : " i often use my body language to show my team ' complete presence ' - and to instill respect , or even better fear , on the opponent .
others had a different view of these outbursts .
" he did n't bite me , but i was happy because this unique athlete had shown a weakness , " said herrlich of the 1999 incident .
regardless of his antics there is no debate that kahn was a superb goalkeeper who won or lost many memorable matches .
an icon in iconic games the 1999 champions league final which munich lost in the final minutes against manchester united .
the 2002 world cup final in yokohama , where the images of him sitting against the right post amid celebrating brazilians are a lasting memory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo scored two past kahn in the 2002 world cup final munich 's champions league triumph in 2001 , the remarkable bundesliga triumph a few days earlier that year from patrick andersson 's goal .
or even just a few weeks ago the uefa cup match in getafe where kahn raced into the penalty area in the last seconds of extra time and luca toni scored the deciding goal .
by then kahn 's image had already become far more positive , due to fewer outbursts and the wisdom of an elder football statesman .
then-coach rudi voeller named the 2002 world cup the turning point with kahn allowing just one goal in six matches to the final , and his error then making him " human after all . "
but kahn showed the biggest greatness in his darkest career hour , being downgraded to germany 's number two behind long-time foe jens lehmann by coach juergen klinsmann just ahead of the home world cup in 2006 .
the entire nation expected him to withdraw from the team , but instead kahn showed himself to be a devoted member of the squad and then even walked up to wish lehmann luck ahead of the penalty shootout with argentina .
respect from friends and foes alike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn showed his magnanimous side in 2006 " i heard what kahn said .

the former germany keeper accepted a brief embrace from referee markus merk , who is also retiring , and modestly acknowledged the applause as he walked off .
he returned after the final whistle to receive the championship shield , his eighth german title at the end of a 21-year career .
" i could n't have asked for any more over the years , " kahn told reporters .
" i just feel grateful my body held out for so long , and i was able to celebrate so many great successes at a club like this . "
" i wanted to be the best " oliver kahn says he knew his destiny from childhood onwards and lived his life accordingly to become one of the most loved or hated figures in german and international football .
" it was my vision from early on : i wanted to be the best goalkeeper in the world .
the best goalkeeper in the world !
the best ! " he says in his upcoming book " i - success comes from within " of which excerpts are printed in the bild daily .
an asian swing with munich will see his last matches with the finale coming for good on may 27 in kolkata , india , against local club mohan bagun .
a testimonial match with munich against germany 's national team wraps up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , quits after 557 bundesliga games , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
revered by some , hated by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has had a love-hate relationship with fans kahn has been named everything from " titan " -lrb- in germany -rrb- and " king kahn " -lrb- fans in asia where he is immensely popular -rrb- to " son of a bitch " -lrb- angry spanish fans who he frustrated so many times in matches against real madrid , valencia or getafe -rrb- during his career spanning almost two decades .
he was pelted with bananas and a golf ball by irate german fans , left his pregnant wife for a new girlfriend and physically attacked players himself .
but everything he did and said in one way or another only underlined his unique dedication .
the bananas were thrown in reference to his almost gorilla-like stature from many hours spent in the gym and on the training field .
his motto is " never give up , " according to his profile on the bayern website .
his characteristics are listed there as " impatient , disciplined , ambitious . "
from karlsruhe to the world kahn 's career started at sc karlsruhe where he played his first bundesliga match in 1987 and was a regular starter from 1990 onwards .
he then left for munich in 1994 to become a legend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn gets up close and personal with miro klose the almost brutal attacks on dortmund 's heiko herrlich and stephane chapuisat , leverkusen 's thomas brdaric , or even a munich team-mate at the time in andreas herzog made plenty of headlines .
kahn names them " positive aggression , saying : " i often use my body language to show my team ' complete presence ' - and to instill respect , or even better fear , on the opponent .
others had a different view of these outbursts .
" he did n't bite me , but i was happy because this unique athlete had shown a weakness , " said herrlich of the 1999 incident .
regardless of his antics there is no debate that kahn was a superb goalkeeper who won or lost many memorable matches .
an icon in iconic games the 1999 champions league final which munich lost in the final minutes against manchester united .
the 2002 world cup final in yokohama , where the images of him sitting against the right post amid celebrating brazilians are a lasting memory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo scored two past kahn in the 2002 world cup final munich 's champions league triumph in 2001 , the remarkable bundesliga triumph a few days earlier that year from patrick andersson 's goal .
or even just a few weeks ago the uefa cup match in getafe where kahn raced into the penalty area in the last seconds of extra time and luca toni scored the deciding goal .
by then kahn 's image had already become far more positive , due to fewer outbursts and the wisdom of an elder football statesman .
then-coach rudi voeller named the 2002 world cup the turning point with kahn allowing just one goal in six matches to the final , and his error then making him " human after all . "
but kahn showed the biggest greatness in his darkest career hour , being downgraded to germany 's number two behind long-time foe jens lehmann by coach juergen klinsmann just ahead of the home world cup in 2006 .
the entire nation expected him to withdraw from the team , but instead kahn showed himself to be a devoted member of the squad and then even walked up to wish lehmann luck ahead of the penalty shootout with argentina .
respect from friends and foes alike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn showed his magnanimous side in 2006 " i heard what kahn said .
it was n't advice , it was encouragement .
this gesture impressed me immensely .
it was absolutely honest , absolute greatness ... i bow before this sporting spirit of oliver kahn , " said goalkeeper coach andreas koepke .
even arsenal 's lehmann had a fond message for kahn last saturday in zdf television .
" despite all our rivalry , i have got to say that your attitude has always impressed me immensely .
i could never lose the motivation to train hard because i knew there was somebody in munich who was training even harder or equally hard with the aim of being the best .
" it helped me to improve and also deal with competition for a place at club level and i thank you for that and wish you all the best for the future , " said lehmann . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former germany keeper accepted a brief embrace from referee markus merk , who is also retiring , and modestly acknowledged the applause as he walked off .
he returned after the final whistle to receive the championship shield , his eighth german title at the end of a 21-year career .
" i could n't have asked for any more over the years , " kahn told reporters .
" i just feel grateful my body held out for so long , and i was able to celebrate so many great successes at a club like this . "
" i wanted to be the best " oliver kahn says he knew his destiny from childhood onwards and lived his life accordingly to become one of the most loved or hated figures in german and international football .
" it was my vision from early on : i wanted to be the best goalkeeper in the world .
the best goalkeeper in the world !
the best ! " he says in his upcoming book " i - success comes from within " of which excerpts are printed in the bild daily .
an asian swing with munich will see his last matches with the finale coming for good on may 27 in kolkata , india , against local club mohan bagun .
a testimonial match with munich against germany 's national team wraps up the farewell on september 2 .
kahn , who turns 39 on june 15 , quits after 557 bundesliga games , with only karl-heinz koerbel -lrb- 602 -rrb- and manfred kaltz -lrb- 581 -rrb- playing more matches in the top flight .
the 86-time capped kahn almost single-handed led germany into the 2002 world cup final , only to blunder there as brazil won 2-0 .
he saved three penalties against valencia in 2001 to give bayern the champions league trophy , one of 16 titles he won with germany 's number one club .
revered by some , hated by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has had a love-hate relationship with fans kahn has been named everything from " titan " -lrb- in germany -rrb- and " king kahn " -lrb- fans in asia where he is immensely popular -rrb- to " son of a bitch " -lrb- angry spanish fans who he frustrated so many times in matches against real madrid , valencia or getafe -rrb- during his career spanning almost two decades .
he was pelted with bananas and a golf ball by irate german fans , left his pregnant wife for a new girlfriend and physically attacked players himself .
but everything he did and said in one way or another only underlined his unique dedication .
the bananas were thrown in reference to his almost gorilla-like stature from many hours spent in the gym and on the training field .
his motto is " never give up , " according to his profile on the bayern website .
his characteristics are listed there as " impatient , disciplined , ambitious . "
from karlsruhe to the world kahn 's career started at sc karlsruhe where he played his first bundesliga match in 1987 and was a regular starter from 1990 onwards .
he then left for munich in 1994 to become a legend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn gets up close and personal with miro klose the almost brutal attacks on dortmund 's heiko herrlich and stephane chapuisat , leverkusen 's thomas brdaric , or even a munich team-mate at the time in andreas herzog made plenty of headlines .
kahn names them " positive aggression , saying : " i often use my body language to show my team ' complete presence ' - and to instill respect , or even better fear , on the opponent .
others had a different view of these outbursts .
" he did n't bite me , but i was happy because this unique athlete had shown a weakness , " said herrlich of the 1999 incident .
regardless of his antics there is no debate that kahn was a superb goalkeeper who won or lost many memorable matches .

the loss of swarms has worsened a long-term collapse in bee populations in many parts of the world that is blamed on the varroa mite infesting hives .
the research institute said late friday 29 out of 30 dead bees it had checked had been killed by contact with the pesticide , which is harmless to humans but lethal to fruit flies and the corn rootworm -lrb- scientific name diabrotica virgifera -rrb- .
farmers in bavaria and baden-wuerttemberg used massive amounts of the pesticide this year in an effort to counter pests .
the institute said it may have blown onto wild plants , fruit trees and rapeseed crops as it was sprayed .
the baden apiarists ' association , with 7,100 members , said saturday it would study a compensation claim against farmers or the pesticide makers and would meet monday with the state agriculture minister , peter hauk .
" the beekeepers have come to a point where they have to deal with securing their existence , " said ekkehard huelsmann , chairman of the apiarists ' association . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

artist in residence hamza bishtawi is a writer and journalist who doubles as the shatila camp co-ordinator with the lebanese local council responsible for the area .
he is also the honourable secretary of the palestinian writers union in lebanon .
the camp is a place of creative energy , we have poets , story-tellers , painters , but they are not given enough exposure , for political reasons .
only the bad side is shown , the overcrowding , the people , the pollution .
you do n't hear about the exchange visits we arrange with people outside the camp , lebanese and internationals .
we see ourselves as upholders of an almost holy cause , for justice for the palestinians .
in the diaspora , we can learn from our compatriots in the west bank and gaza , and we can carry on the cause ourselves .
it is like a marathon run as a relay race .
i was born in 1965 in lebanon .
i was outside palestine but i insist on life , and our sacrifice is for life and not for death .
my home is acre , in palestine .
but i will never go to visit it as a tourist .
i will go to claim my land .
it is close , it wo n't be long .
i 'm sure that our return will be in less than the 60 years we have been absent .
the countdown has started .
veteran teacher ahmed halimeh is a science teacher in a un-run school for palestinian refugees .
out of school he does social work for a non-governmental organisation he co-founded .
i have taught generations of children in shatila camp .
we have hardly enough time and resources to give them the education they need .
the schools work double shifts , with two schools of about 300 pupils sharing one building - they take it in turns to have lessons in early morning or the evening .
if children drop out of school , i see it as my duty to go and visit the family and try to persuade them to return .
education is the best weapon the palestinian refugees have , their only weapon .
i have lived through the worst times in this camp .
when we were under siege in the war of the camps , i went from house to house to make sure people had food and water .
conditions were absolutely inhuman .
now times are better and the shia militiamen who used to shoot at us are now our neighbours .
i still see the sniper who used to fire at me in the market .
we say hello to each other - i will never point him out to my son , in case he wants to take revenge !
dedicated medic hala abdul rahman is a doctor at the palestinian red crescent clinic in shatila camp .
palestinian refugees are not permitted to work in lebanese hospitals or medical centres .
my family is from kabri , northern galilee .
it was the scene of a big battle in which 100 british soldiers were killed in the 1930s .
afterwards everything was destroyed by israel except the cemetery where my grandfather is buried .
my brother and sister were both martyred in battles in the 1980s .
the israelis took my cousin to ansar prison in 1982 and we never saw him again .
but i consider myself and my family lucky .
in some cases there were ' houses which were closed ' -lrb- that is families where everyone died -rrb- .
palestinian doctors working for the un make about $ 200 a month , which is not much for someone with medical training .
many qualified people leave to work in europe or the gulf , where they can make much higher salaries .
but i am going to stay here , because the people in the camp need our help .
party official suleiman abul hadi is the chair of shatila 's popular committee which is in charge of the day-to-day administration of the camp .
he belongs to a pro-syrian splinter group called fatah intifada which has strong support in the camp .
we do n't have rights here .
lebanon wants to follow the us plan to either naturalise us or send us back to a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza .
the palestinian authority also wants to remove us from the equation .
but we insist that we must go back to our soil , our homes , our towns .
the worst option would be surrender to israel and return to a miniature palestinian state .
that would just start a new round of conflict .
i do n't want to throw the jews into the sea , i want us to live together , if they want to .
i have 11 children , but i am ready to have 20 children .
we bring up our children so that even before they tell you their name they will say ' i am a palestinian ' .
it is a treasure that our children accept their situation with such good grace .
we have a very good society , a cohesive society with solidarity and a collective spirit , pride and self-respect .
that does not mean we accept , frankly , the shit that we live amongst , the intermittent electricity , the undrinkable water .
the crucial thing is to raise the level of services , especially education , with 40 children per class and overworked teachers , and medical services , some of which are n't covered by the un at haifa hospital -lrb- in burj al-barajneh camp -rrb- .
people are dying unnecessarily ; our hospital does n't do echo cardiograms , for example ; if someone has a medical emergency sometimes it takes too long for the ambulances to arrive from burj to save them .
palestine pilgrim abu nisa runs a thriving laundry and ironing business just outside shatila camp , but he has spent most of his life living on the east side of the camp .
his family lived in the town of majdal kurum in galilee , famed for the quality of its grape vines .
refugees from the town operate a committee to keep traditional activities and the folklore of their town alive in the diaspora .
i have visited palestine twice .
i went on a kind of pilgrimage to our holy places , so i went to pray at the al-aqsa mosque in jerusalem and the next time i went to the ibrahimi mosque in hebron and prayed there .
i am certain we shall return to palestine , if not us then our children or our grandchildren will return .
it is true that many sons of shatila camp take european passports if they are given the opportunity .
but what do they do when they get danish nationality or swedish nationality ?
the first thing they do is use it to travel to palestine .
camp security abu wisam -lrb- not pictured -rrb- is the elected head of the shatila popular security committee .
his group is supported by all the political factions in the camp and is responsible for law and order and keeping the peace .
if we have a problem between two people in the camp which results in violence or a fight , i like to be the first person to visit them , unarmed , by myself , to see if i can solve it peacefully , within the camp .
if someone is injured i would rather the one who caused it paid compensation than for him to be handed to the lebanese police .
sometime we punish criminals by locking them up in a cell we have , or by cutting their hair off .
only if it is a serious crime like rape or murder would we get the police involved .
the police do not have the capability to come into the camp without our co-operation .
in 2006 , fatah al-islam -lrb- an armed group which battled government forces for months in nahr al-bared camp , causing hundreds of deaths and widespread destruction -rrb- came to shatila and because we were alert to the danger we were able to expel them before they caused any trouble .
we probably averted disaster for shatila camp like this .

the snowdonia society has written to the welsh assembly government setting out a proposed claim for judicial review .
the dispute centres on a 125-year lease for a former military airfield at llanbedr , near harlech , gwynedd .
however , new operators kemble air services insist the deal will go ahead despite a potential high court hearing .
" there 's no question of us pulling out because of a threat from an unelected body , " said david young of the air operators .
" i 've been to llanbedr this week with two of our other directors .
we had an overwhelmingly positive response from everyone we met .
there 's a huge amount of goodwill . "
" the society has been attempting to seek confirmation that welsh ministers have acted lawfully " david firth , snowdonia society legal action was first threatened by the new director of the snowdonia society , former assembly government culture minister alun pugh .
he argued that evidence to show that leasing the site met special planning requirements for national parks such as snowdonia had not been produced .
in a letter to assembly government counsel general carwyn jones , the chairman of the society david firth spelt out why it intends pursuing legal action .
" since 3 march , the society has been attempting to seek confirmation that welsh ministers have acted lawfully by several freedom of information act requests to see evidence , " he stated .
" this information has not been supplied . "
opponents to the airport development claim it will harm the environment and deter tourism in the area petition however , the assembly government has previously insisted that the development is simply a continuation of flying at the site .
the airport also has the backing of many local residents , who handed a 1,000-name petition to their am , lord elis-thomas .
gwynli jones , a former community councillor from near harlech , collected the signatures and claimed the air operations would benefit the area .
" this place was run as an airfield from 1939 until it closed four years ago .
if anything it is more noisy since it closed because now jets from -lsb- raf -rsb- valley fly over , " he said .
" the whole area from barmouth to porthmadog wants this .
in the 1,000 people i asked to sign the petition , only one man refused . "

it will take the form of one hour-long test of literacy and numeracy , and it will be held in a grammar school .
however , the minister faced sharp questions from unionist and sdlp mlas whilst the dup said her plans would not be agreed by the assembly .
friday 's committee hearing followed a contentious meeting of the executive during which three separate proposals for progress were rejected .
first minister ian paisley said ms ruane 's plans to reform academic selection could not go ahead without dup and executive support .
thursday 's executive meeting ended without a full discussion of the plans .
ms ruane told the executive there were parties " who were anti-change in relation to education " .
the minister 's proposals have been criticised by grammar schools who said their acceptance of them would be " like turkeys voting for christmas " .
but frank bunting of teachers ' union , into , said the plan was a sensible and pragmatic roadmap out of the impasse .
last december , ms ruane announced the transfer test , commonly known as the 11-plus , would come to an end in 2008 .

speaking on inside politics martin mcguinness said the dup and sinn féin had surmounted other challenges in the past .
he said their experienced negotiators were capable of finding a compromise .
" there 's going to have to be some lateral thinking applied to all of this , there 's going to have to be some considerable brainstorming , " he said .
" and i believe that we are capable if there 's a will to deal with this issue we are capable of engaging in a real debate , discussion , dialogue and indeed negotiation to take this forward . "
on friday , education minister caitríona ruane faced the assembly 's education committee about her plans for primary school transfer .
she aims to extend academic selection for three years before ending it .
it will take the form of one hour-long test of literacy and numeracy , and it will be held in a grammar school .
however , the minister faced sharp questions from unionist and sdlp mlas whilst the dup said her plans would not be agreed by the assembly .
friday 's committee hearing followed a contentious meeting of the executive during which three separate proposals for progress were rejected .
first minister ian paisley said ms ruane 's plans to reform academic selection could not go ahead without dup and executive support .
thursday 's executive meeting ended without a full discussion of the plans .
ms ruane told the executive there were parties " who were anti-change in relation to education " .
the minister 's proposals have been criticised by grammar schools who said their acceptance of them would be " like turkeys voting for christmas " .
but frank bunting of teachers ' union , into , said the plan was a sensible and pragmatic roadmap out of the impasse .

are you hoping to avoid watching the match , its associated build-up and the aftermath ?
well read on because there are plenty of things you can do to occupy your time while the bluebirds fly the flag for wales at wembley .
in cardiff , the streets are sure to be eerily empty thanks to the thousands of city fans enjoying their day out at wembley and those without tickets being glued to television sets in pubs and living rooms .
so what better opportunity could there be to check out the city centre shops and tourist attractions ?
you could n't possibly watch the cup final if you get a facemask you 'll have a fair crack at the early summer sale bargains and if you want a bit of culture , this could be your chance to tour cardiff castle or the artes mundi exhibition at the national museum cardiff .
if you 're keen to avoid television at all costs then get yourself to the st fagans national history museum on the outskirts of cardiff .
exploring farmhouses from the 18th century , medieval churches and miner 's cottages , not to mention scoffing welsh cakes , should all make for a diverting afternoon - and there wo n't be a goggle-box in sight .
seeing as the wags -lrb- wives and girlfriends -rrb- of the city players will have moved enmasse to north london for the day , the plush pamper rooms of the region 's hotels and salons should be much quieter than usual .
so treat yourself - get a facial , a massage , a manicure , a pedicure , aromatherapy , a spray tan , a cut and blow dry .
the list is endless .
unfortunately , the weather forecast for the weekend is n't exactly fabulous , so unless you 're a brave soul , camping and barbecuing are out .
avoid the footy and go to see the puffins on skomer island however this might be an ideal opportunity for you to get on with some gardening , a bit of diy , catch up on some film releases at the cinema and on dvd or even take in a round of golf .
in fact , getting out in the fresh air would be both invigorating and a clever fa cup avoidance tactic .
there are no televisions on the brecon beacons for example or on the top of the garth mountain , just north-west of cardiff , or along the coastal paths of the gower .
if you 're into your wildlife , slightly further afield is skomer island off the pembrokeshire coast .
the island is a sanctuary to a wide range of birds including puffins and razorbills and at this time of year is covered in a carpet of beautiful bluebells .
or maybe you could tune in and watch the first days of the first osprey chick which hatched on its gwynedd nest on friday and is being covered by a web camera .
so as you can see , there 's plenty of ways to avoid the wall-to-wall football this weekend .
and if all else fails , you could always pop down to swansea for the day where their club 's supporters will be far less excited by the final and may even provide a refreshing point of view on their preferred team .
