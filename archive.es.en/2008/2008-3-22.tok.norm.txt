on saturday , march 22 , protestors in amsterdam demonstrated against the film 's maker . far-right lawmaker geert wilders plans to release a film attacking islam and the koran , despite complaints from religious groups and warnings that it could provoke violent protests around the world . on friday , march 21 , the netherlands islamic federation asked a court in the hague to set up a panel of censors to review the film , in order to discover if there is any reason for it to be banned . the dutch government , while calling on wilders to abandon his project , has previously said there is no legal way to censor a film before it appears . the court will rule on the association 's request by march 28 .
wilders has said that he will release the film " before april 1 , " posting it on the internet if he fails to find a broadcaster willing to carry it . " fascist book " wilders said in november that the 15-minute film would show the koran was a " fascist book , " a claim which has already drawn complaints from several muslim countries , including pakistan , indonesia , egypt , iran and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert wilders , leader of the party for freedom dutch officials have unsuccessfully urged him to drop the project , fearing a repeat of the violent protests that erupted in many countries when european newspapers printed cartoons mocking the prophet mohammed . the case has also recalled that of dutch filmmaker and polemicist theo van gogh , who was murdered by an islamic extremist in amsterdam in 2004 after he made a short film attacking islam 's treatment of women . protests in amsterdam several thousand people participated in a rally in amsterdam on saturday , march 22 , against wilders .
the rally , an initiative of the anti-racism organisation nederland bekent kleur , or " netherlands shows its colors , " was to protest the " intolerant and discriminatory viewpoints " of the dutch opposition legislator . " i 'm very much against geert wilders and racism in general , but i think it 's really important to show not only holland but the rest of the world that there 's a lot of people who do not agree with his ideas , 2 demonstrator elisa trepp told the associated press .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear widespread protests against the film such as those in the wake of the mohammed caricatures earlier some 5,000 dutch nationals signed a petition against wilders . wilders is the leader of the dutch freedom party , which runs on a platform of harsh criticism of islam and immigrants .
his party holds nine seats in the 150-member dutch parliament . ever since he announced he would make a film about the koran in november , he has been in the headlines in holland and captured international media attention . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , march 22 , protestors in amsterdam demonstrated against the film 's maker . far-right lawmaker geert wilders plans to release a film attacking islam and the koran , despite complaints from religious groups and warnings that it could provoke violent protests around the world . on friday , march 21 , the netherlands islamic federation asked a court in the hague to set up a panel of censors to review the film , in order to discover if there is any reason for it to be banned . the dutch government , while calling on wilders to abandon his project , has previously said there is no legal way to censor a film before it appears . the court will rule on the association 's request by march 28 .
wilders has said that he will release the film " before april 1 , " posting it on the internet if he fails to find a broadcaster willing to carry it . " fascist book " wilders said in november that the 15-minute film would show the koran was a " fascist book , " a claim which has already drawn complaints from several muslim countries , including pakistan , indonesia , egypt , iran and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert wilders , leader of the party for freedom dutch officials have unsuccessfully urged him to drop the project , fearing a repeat of the violent protests that erupted in many countries when european newspapers printed cartoons mocking the prophet mohammed . the case has also recalled that of dutch filmmaker and polemicist theo van gogh , who was murdered by an islamic extremist in amsterdam in 2004 after he made a short film attacking islam 's treatment of women . protests in amsterdam several thousand people participated in a rally in amsterdam on saturday , march 22 , against wilders .
the rally , an initiative of the anti-racism organisation nederland bekent kleur , or " netherlands shows its colors , " was to protest the " intolerant and discriminatory viewpoints " of the dutch opposition legislator . " i 'm very much against geert wilders and racism in general , but i think it 's really important to show not only holland but the rest of the world that there 's a lot of people who do not agree with his ideas , 2 demonstrator elisa trepp told the associated press .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear widespread protests against the film such as those in the wake of the mohammed caricatures earlier some 5,000 dutch nationals signed a petition against wilders . wilders is the leader of the dutch freedom party , which runs on a platform of harsh criticism of islam and immigrants .
his party holds nine seats in the 150-member dutch parliament . ever since he announced he would make a film about the koran in november , he has been in the headlines in holland and captured international media attention . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they filmed in english to make the movie more attractive to an international audience . heroism despite senselessness of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richthofen received several medals for his service talk of war is kept to a minimum in germany , and patriotic statements are deliberately avoided .
it 's all the more unusual , then , that the film presents richthofen as a hero , while not glorifying war .
in fact , it 's been called an anti-war war movie . " historically there has been reluctance and there are strong voices in germany still saying we 're not allowed to do this : a film about a german war hero , " said the film 's writer and director nikolai muellerschoen , as reported by the " guardian online . "
" but the film makes a very clear statement against war . " though richthofen is known for having been an efficient war machine , the film depicts a sensitive , human hero who is made aware of the brutality of war through his love for his nurse kaete -lrb- british actress lena headey -rrb- .
despite the exciting air escapades in his fokker dr 1 , richthofen discovers that war is not a game . cause of death remains unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the set of " the red baron " the red baron lost his life in the line of duty on april 21 , 1918 - just weeks before the end of the war .
the exact circumstances of his death remain unknown . the movie is part of a rising interest in germany in war history and follows on the heels of similar war films like " the downfall , " an account of the last days in adolf hitler 's berlin bunker , and tom cruise 's upcoming movie on claus von stauffenberg , who led a plot to assassinate the fuehrer . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , march 22 , protestors in amsterdam demonstrated against the film 's maker . far-right lawmaker geert wilders plans to release a film attacking islam and the koran , despite complaints from religious groups and warnings that it could provoke violent protests around the world . on friday , march 21 , the netherlands islamic federation asked a court in the hague to set up a panel of censors to review the film , in order to discover if there is any reason for it to be banned . the dutch government , while calling on wilders to abandon his project , has previously said there is no legal way to censor a film before it appears . the court will rule on the association 's request by march 28 .
wilders has said that he will release the film " before april 1 , " posting it on the internet if he fails to find a broadcaster willing to carry it . " fascist book " wilders said in november that the 15-minute film would show the koran was a " fascist book , " a claim which has already drawn complaints from several muslim countries , including pakistan , indonesia , egypt , iran and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert wilders , leader of the party for freedom dutch officials have unsuccessfully urged him to drop the project , fearing a repeat of the violent protests that erupted in many countries when european newspapers printed cartoons mocking the prophet mohammed . the case has also recalled that of dutch filmmaker and polemicist theo van gogh , who was murdered by an islamic extremist in amsterdam in 2004 after he made a short film attacking islam 's treatment of women . protests in amsterdam several thousand people participated in a rally in amsterdam on saturday , march 22 , against wilders .
the rally , an initiative of the anti-racism organisation nederland bekent kleur , or " netherlands shows its colors , " was to protest the " intolerant and discriminatory viewpoints " of the dutch opposition legislator . " i 'm very much against geert wilders and racism in general , but i think it 's really important to show not only holland but the rest of the world that there 's a lot of people who do not agree with his ideas , 2 demonstrator elisa trepp told the associated press .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear widespread protests against the film such as those in the wake of the mohammed caricatures earlier some 5,000 dutch nationals signed a petition against wilders . wilders is the leader of the dutch freedom party , which runs on a platform of harsh criticism of islam and immigrants .
his party holds nine seats in the 150-member dutch parliament . ever since he announced he would make a film about the koran in november , he has been in the headlines in holland and captured international media attention . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's all the more unusual , then , that the film presents richthofen as a hero , while not glorifying war .
in fact , it 's been called an anti-war war movie . " historically there has been reluctance and there are strong voices in germany still saying we 're not allowed to do this : a film about a german war hero , " said the film 's writer and director nikolai muellerschoen , as reported by the " guardian online . "
" but the film makes a very clear statement against war . " though richthofen is known for having been an efficient war machine , the film depicts a sensitive , human hero who is made aware of the brutality of war through his love for his nurse kaete -lrb- british actress lena headey -rrb- .
despite the exciting air escapades in his fokker dr 1 , richthofen discovers that war is not a game . cause of death remains unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the set of " the red baron " the red baron lost his life in the line of duty on april 21 , 1918 - just weeks before the end of the war .
the exact circumstances of his death remain unknown . the movie is part of a rising interest in germany in war history and follows on the heels of similar war films like " the downfall , " an account of the last days in adolf hitler 's berlin bunker , and tom cruise 's upcoming movie on claus von stauffenberg , who led a plot to assassinate the fuehrer . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the republic of ireland gave up its territorial claim to ni in the referendum that followed the good friday agreement , the republic of ireland voted by more than 90 % to give up its territorial claim to northern ireland in exchange for north-south bodies .
bbc ni 's dublin correspondent shane harrison asks if the two parts of the island have become closer since then .
motorists find it increasingly hard to tell where exactly the border is , with roads and motorways seamlessly linking one jurisdiction with the other .
but equally , it 's easy to argue that over the last 10 years the republic and northern ireland have grown miles apart .
that 's because the republic has become more self-consciously european , with the changeover to kilometres .
speedometer since the middle of 2004 , new cars south of the border no longer have miles indicators on their speedometer .
many argue that the introduction of the euro , massive immigration to an -lrb- at least until recently -rrb- booming celtic tiger economy and a growing lack of media interest in what is happening in the other jurisdiction have accelerated a moving apart .
eamon delaney , a former irish diplomat , and the editor of the current affairs magazine , magill , subscribes to that view .
he says : " there are many factors , nothing to do with politics necessarily : the celtic tiger , the multi-cultural globalised nature of the south means it has drifted apart from northern ireland . "
mr ahern denies there has been a political disengagement the irish minister for foreign affairs , dermot ahern , a border td , denies there has been a political disengagement .
he points to good relations on the north-south ministerial council , business moving north across the border and his government 's commitment to give northern ireland more than half a billion euros for infrastructure projects in the coming years .
but , he says , he understands why people in the republic may be disappointed with the impact of the north-south bodies that replaced articles 2 and 3 of the constitution which laid claim to northern ireland .
" the cross-border bodies have been , to a certain extent , hamstrung by the fact that the institutions were in suspension , " he says .
" i think now that you have the full working institutions , it will allow the north-south bodies to move on in even greater store . "
' disappointing ' sinn féin 's dáil leader , caoimhghin o 'caolain , is one of those who believes the performance of the north-south bodies has been disappointing - partly , he says , because there is n't enough of them and partly because they do n't appear to impact on daily lives .
he makes little secret of the fact that republicans now believe the road to their long cherished united ireland is through an all-ireland economy .
" we have clearly to accept the logic that a single island economy that would be to the benefit of all people on the island of ireland can only best be served through one single administration on the island of ireland that cherishes all its children equally . "
dublin was the centre of the republic 's economic boom dr garret fitzgerald was taoiseach at the time of the anglo-irish agreement that first gave the republic a say in northern ireland 's affairs .
decades of violence , resulting in massive subsidies from london and the failure by unionists in the good friday agreement to negotiate a similar corporation tax rate as the republic , and their unwillingness to have one industrial development body for the island , means the two parts of ireland have grown further apart economically , he says .
and that , he argues , makes irish political union even more remote .
without the subsidies , he says , " northern ireland would be 20 % worse off which means that even the most ardent sinn féin supporter vote against it or , alternatively , we 'd have to increase our burden of taxation by a quarter , which is n't going to happen . "
ten years after the good friday agreement , ireland is still on a journey .
relations between north and south are certainly much better , even though no-one can be certain whether the road ends with irish unity , a stronger union with britain or somewhere in between .

the republic of ireland gave up its territorial claim to ni in the referendum that followed the good friday agreement , the republic of ireland voted by more than 90 % to give up its territorial claim to northern ireland in exchange for north-south bodies .
bbc ni 's dublin correspondent shane harrison asks if the two parts of the island have become closer since then .
motorists find it increasingly hard to tell where exactly the border is , with roads and motorways seamlessly linking one jurisdiction with the other .
but equally , it 's easy to argue that over the last 10 years the republic and northern ireland have grown miles apart .
that 's because the republic has become more self-consciously european , with the changeover to kilometres .
speedometer since the middle of 2004 , new cars south of the border no longer have miles indicators on their speedometer .
many argue that the introduction of the euro , massive immigration to an -lrb- at least until recently -rrb- booming celtic tiger economy and a growing lack of media interest in what is happening in the other jurisdiction have accelerated a moving apart .
eamon delaney , a former irish diplomat , and the editor of the current affairs magazine , magill , subscribes to that view .
he says : " there are many factors , nothing to do with politics necessarily : the celtic tiger , the multi-cultural globalised nature of the south means it has drifted apart from northern ireland . "
mr ahern denies there has been a political disengagement the irish minister for foreign affairs , dermot ahern , a border td , denies there has been a political disengagement .
he points to good relations on the north-south ministerial council , business moving north across the border and his government 's commitment to give northern ireland more than half a billion euros for infrastructure projects in the coming years .
but , he says , he understands why people in the republic may be disappointed with the impact of the north-south bodies that replaced articles 2 and 3 of the constitution which laid claim to northern ireland .
" the cross-border bodies have been , to a certain extent , hamstrung by the fact that the institutions were in suspension , " he says .
" i think now that you have the full working institutions , it will allow the north-south bodies to move on in even greater store . "
' disappointing ' sinn féin 's dáil leader , caoimhghin o 'caolain , is one of those who believes the performance of the north-south bodies has been disappointing - partly , he says , because there is n't enough of them and partly because they do n't appear to impact on daily lives .
he makes little secret of the fact that republicans now believe the road to their long cherished united ireland is through an all-ireland economy .
" we have clearly to accept the logic that a single island economy that would be to the benefit of all people on the island of ireland can only best be served through one single administration on the island of ireland that cherishes all its children equally . "
dublin was the centre of the republic 's economic boom dr garret fitzgerald was taoiseach at the time of the anglo-irish agreement that first gave the republic a say in northern ireland 's affairs .
decades of violence , resulting in massive subsidies from london and the failure by unionists in the good friday agreement to negotiate a similar corporation tax rate as the republic , and their unwillingness to have one industrial development body for the island , means the two parts of ireland have grown further apart economically , he says .
and that , he argues , makes irish political union even more remote .
without the subsidies , he says , " northern ireland would be 20 % worse off which means that even the most ardent sinn féin supporter vote against it or , alternatively , we 'd have to increase our burden of taxation by a quarter , which is n't going to happen . "
ten years after the good friday agreement , ireland is still on a journey .
relations between north and south are certainly much better , even though no-one can be certain whether the road ends with irish unity , a stronger union with britain or somewhere in between .

the republic of ireland gave up its territorial claim to ni in the referendum that followed the good friday agreement , the republic of ireland voted by more than 90 % to give up its territorial claim to northern ireland in exchange for north-south bodies .
bbc ni 's dublin correspondent shane harrison asks if the two parts of the island have become closer since then .
motorists find it increasingly hard to tell where exactly the border is , with roads and motorways seamlessly linking one jurisdiction with the other .
but equally , it 's easy to argue that over the last 10 years the republic and northern ireland have grown miles apart .
that 's because the republic has become more self-consciously european , with the changeover to kilometres .
speedometer since the middle of 2004 , new cars south of the border no longer have miles indicators on their speedometer .
many argue that the introduction of the euro , massive immigration to an -lrb- at least until recently -rrb- booming celtic tiger economy and a growing lack of media interest in what is happening in the other jurisdiction have accelerated a moving apart .
eamon delaney , a former irish diplomat , and the editor of the current affairs magazine , magill , subscribes to that view .
he says : " there are many factors , nothing to do with politics necessarily : the celtic tiger , the multi-cultural globalised nature of the south means it has drifted apart from northern ireland . "
mr ahern denies there has been a political disengagement the irish minister for foreign affairs , dermot ahern , a border td , denies there has been a political disengagement .
he points to good relations on the north-south ministerial council , business moving north across the border and his government 's commitment to give northern ireland more than half a billion euros for infrastructure projects in the coming years .
but , he says , he understands why people in the republic may be disappointed with the impact of the north-south bodies that replaced articles 2 and 3 of the constitution which laid claim to northern ireland .
" the cross-border bodies have been , to a certain extent , hamstrung by the fact that the institutions were in suspension , " he says .
" i think now that you have the full working institutions , it will allow the north-south bodies to move on in even greater store . "
' disappointing ' sinn féin 's dáil leader , caoimhghin o 'caolain , is one of those who believes the performance of the north-south bodies has been disappointing - partly , he says , because there is n't enough of them and partly because they do n't appear to impact on daily lives .
he makes little secret of the fact that republicans now believe the road to their long cherished united ireland is through an all-ireland economy .
" we have clearly to accept the logic that a single island economy that would be to the benefit of all people on the island of ireland can only best be served through one single administration on the island of ireland that cherishes all its children equally . "
dublin was the centre of the republic 's economic boom dr garret fitzgerald was taoiseach at the time of the anglo-irish agreement that first gave the republic a say in northern ireland 's affairs .
decades of violence , resulting in massive subsidies from london and the failure by unionists in the good friday agreement to negotiate a similar corporation tax rate as the republic , and their unwillingness to have one industrial development body for the island , means the two parts of ireland have grown further apart economically , he says .
and that , he argues , makes irish political union even more remote .
without the subsidies , he says , " northern ireland would be 20 % worse off which means that even the most ardent sinn féin supporter vote against it or , alternatively , we 'd have to increase our burden of taxation by a quarter , which is n't going to happen . "
ten years after the good friday agreement , ireland is still on a journey .

the bbc 's michael bristow recently visited the point in mainland china which is nearest to taiwan to examine this tense relationship .
there are a few places in the world where political tension has left arch-enemies eyeballing each other across a narrow divide .
until it was torn down , the berlin wall was one of those places ; the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea still exists .
and a 1,500 metre-wide stretch of water between the chinese port of xiamen and the taiwanese-controlled island of jinmen is another contentious border .
it divides communist china from the democratic island chain of taiwan .
the tiny island is a reminder of ongoing political tension in the taiwan strait .
the two sides separated after a civil war in china in 1949 , leaving taiwan in limbo - it is not a separate country , but it is not part of china either .
this unresolved issue once led to the regular exchange of artillery fire across the water between xiamen and kinmen -lrb- which is sometimes also referred to as jinmen -rrb- .
if continuing tension between the two sides escalates , this narrow stretch of sea could once again become the front line in a new war .
quiet waters - for now however at the moment , the waters of the taiwan strait look anything but dangerous .
the only fighting is between xiamen 's tour operators , who compete for chinese tourists eager to sail up to kinmen to get a look at the " enemy " .
ticket sellers stand along the dockside trying to coax passers-by into joining two-hour cruises that costs 126 yuan -lrb- £ 8.70 , $ 17.80 -rrb- per person .
it is clear from the start that this is a different kind of boat tour .
security officials inspect id cards before people board and there is a constant running commentary about the trip 's significance .
the announcer points out xiamen 's highest point , where visiting national leaders usually go to have a look at kinmen . "
my feeling is that we should go and unite with taiwan immediately .
if the peaceful way does n't work , we would use force .
we must liberate taiwan " chinese tourist she also directs tourists ' gaze towards a tiny island manned by chinese soldiers from the people 's liberation army .
even the ship 's name - chenggong - is full of meaning .
it is named after the chinese commander who captured taiwan from the dutch .
" my feeling is that we should go and unite with taiwan immediately , " said one tourist as the boat approached kinmen .
" if the peaceful way does n't work , we would use force .
we must liberate taiwan . "
another tourist said kinmen " belongs to china , that 's for sure .
taiwan and mainland will be united in the future . "
no separation the belief expressed by chinese sightseers that the two sides will eventually be reunified is shared by the chinese authorities .
if it ever wanted to follow up on these suggestions , the government could use the six warships that were docked in xiamen 's harbour .
in his " state-of-the-union " address to the chinese parliament earlier this month , premier wen jiabao reiterated china 's position on this issue .
" we will never allow anyone to separate taiwan from the motherland in any guise or by any means , " he told delegates .
" reunification of the two sides is inevitable in the course of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation . "
that has basically been china 's position for the last half a century or so , but it is not sitting idly by and waiting for its hopes to be fulfilled .
it has reserved the right to use force against taiwan if it declares independence , and is believed to have missiles still pointing at the island to back up that threat .
it also tries to isolate taiwan from the rest of the world , opposing , for example , taiwan 's many bids to join the united nations .
at the same time , it holds out the prospect of talks , although beijing will only sit down with those taiwanese who agree that china and taiwan are one and the same country .
politics seems a world away on the jinmen pleasure boat , which does not actually go to the island ; it stops a few hundred metres short of the shore .
ahead of them , chinese tourists can see a flag of the republic of china , the official name of taiwan , fluttering in the breeze .
there is also a sentry point and a giant slogan outlining taiwan 's political philosophy .
the tourists take pictures , and then the boat turns around and heads for xiamen .
kinmen , a historical oddity , is left alone until another day .

the bbc 's michael bristow recently visited the point in mainland china which is nearest to taiwan to examine this tense relationship .
there are a few places in the world where political tension has left arch-enemies eyeballing each other across a narrow divide .
chinese tourists are eager to sail to jinmen to get a look at the ' enemy ' until it was torn down , the berlin wall was one of those places ; the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea still exists .
and a 1,500 metre-wide stretch of water between the chinese port of xiamen and the taiwanese-controlled island of jinmen is another contentious border .
it divides communist china from the democratic island chain of taiwan .
the tiny island is a reminder of ongoing political tension in the taiwan strait .
the two sides separated after a civil war in china in 1949 , leaving taiwan in limbo - it is not a separate country , but it is not part of china either .
this unresolved issue once led to the regular exchange of artillery fire across the water between xiamen and kinmen -lrb- which is sometimes also referred to as jinmen -rrb- .
if continuing tension between the two sides escalates , this narrow stretch of sea could once again become the front line in a new war .
quiet waters - for now however at the moment , the waters of the taiwan strait look anything but dangerous .
there is a running commentary about the trip 's significance the only fighting is between xiamen 's tour operators , who compete for chinese tourists eager to sail up to kinmen to get a look at the " enemy " .
ticket sellers stand along the dockside trying to coax passers-by into joining two-hour cruises that costs 126 yuan -lrb- £ 8.70 , $ 17.80 -rrb- per person .
it is clear from the start that this is a different kind of boat tour .

speaking during the easter celebrations dr morgan said it was immoral " to encourage people to borrow more money than they could afford " .
he added there was something wrong with a system that allowed this to happen .
in dr morgan 's easter sermon he will say that while there is no absolute proof the resurrection of jesus happened , faith is more important .
dr morgan said those who had been allowed to borrow more money than they could afford were the first people to go to the wall .
his comments come as the united states sub-prime mortgage crisis , where borrowers were granted mortgages inappropriately , has lead to plunging property prices , a slowdown in the us economy and billions in losses by banks .
according to a draft version of the international monetary fund 's world economic outlook report , the us economy is " close to a possible recession " .
we put our trust in all kinds of things except the things that matter dr barry morgan mortgage lenders in the uk have also tightened their lending criteria , making it harder for first time buyers to get on the property ladder because a larger deposit is required .
dr morgan said economic uncertainty like this could force people to address eternal questions .
" it 's like when people are sometimes faced with the prospect of dying through a fatal disease and you just realise you 've been worrying about 1001 things .
we put our trust in all kinds of things except the things that matter , " he told the western mail newspaper .
in his easter sermon to be delivered at llandaff cathedral in cardiff on sunday , dr morgan will highlight to his congregation the varying gospel accounts of the life and death of jesus , saying it is more essential to look at the truths they convey and not if they happened .
' different conclusions ' the archbishop will take st john 's story of mary magdalene 's encounter with jesus outside the tomb in the garden on the first day of the week after his resurrection to illustrate his point .
he will conclude that the stories need to be seen from the perspective of faith as well as reason .
" faith is not certainty - it is seeing life in a certain way , and realizing its true significance , " says dr morgan .
" the christian and the non christian live in the same world and see the same things and yet come to different conclusions about their significance .
" there are , of course , no knockdown arguments for the truth of the resurrection , any more than there are for the existence of god .
" faith is a way of seeing and in seeing understanding and in understanding believing and in believing seeking to live out the divine life of serving god and his world . "

the us-educated lawyer , standing for the kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- , served as minister for justice and minister without portfolio during the 1990s .
analysts say he built himself a squeaky-clean reputation during that time .
he first showed potential to run for the top job by beating chen shui-ban , the island 's current president , in the elections for taipei mayor in 1998 .
and in 2005 , his place among the island 's elite politicians was consolidated when he was chosen as chairman of the kmt .
but in late 2006 his political career - and his incorruptible image - appeared to have fallen apart .
allegations emerged that he had misappropriated 11.2 million taiwanese dollars -lrb- $ 339,000 -rrb- of funds while mayor of taipei .
mr ma quit as mayor , and then as party chairman , to fight the charges .
he spent much of early 2007 in court - but despite this , the kmt confirmed him as their presidential candidate .
eventually the 57-year-old was cleared of all charges and launched his campaign for the presidency promising to restore the rapid economic growth taiwan enjoyed during the 1980s and 90s .
he also wants closer ties with beijing , and said he would open direct air and shipping links with china .
father-of-two mr ma was born in hong kong and went to law school in taiwan and the us .
he is said to be a fitness enthusiast and lists music , jogging and swimming as his hobbies .
