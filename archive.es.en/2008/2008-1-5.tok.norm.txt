her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .
makatsch to star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say heike makatsch bears a resemblance to knef in the film about her life , she will be played by german actress heike makatsch , who was recently awarded a german film prize for her lead role performance in another biographical picture about margarete steiff , the wheelchair-bound founder of a famous german teddy bear manufacturing company .
knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .
makatsch , who many say bears a striking resemblance to knef , should also be able to relate to her character since she - despite flirting with hollywood success - remains a much bigger name in the german-speaking world . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.01.2008 german diplomat ousted from iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains concerned about iran 's nuclear ambitions iran has expelled a german diplomat for " non-diplomatic activities , " the iranian foreign ministry said on sunday , dec .
6 , in an incident apparently related to the expulsion by germany of an iranian diplomat last summer . " those in charge recognized that non-diplomatic activities are being undertaken and announced that this diplomat should leave the soil of the islamic republic of iran , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini told a news conference .
a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .
the hamburg-based weekly der spiegel reported last month that berlin had previously expelled an iranian diplomat in july after he allegedly sought to purchase equipment for his country 's controversial nuclear program .
the man , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reportedly in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria in an apparent attempt to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment the german foreign ministry declined to comment at the time .
western nations have been pushing for iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could potentially lead to the production of atomic weapons and their placement in the hands of fundamentalists .
tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
vital interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel sees iran as a challenge for germany 's foreign policy in a recent article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , german chancellor merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community .
she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous .
" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .
28 .
reformists hope to mend ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes meanwhile , iran 's reformist politicians pledged on saturday to put an end to the ongoing crisis in relations with the west if they win the upcoming parliamentary elections .
" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .
registration for parliamentary elections state television said prospective candidates started registering to stand in the election for the 290-seat parliament throughout the islamic republic .
hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .
all candidates , however , have to be approved by the hardline unelected guardians council , which has the right to disqualify any candidate it deems to be insufficiently qualified .

" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "

" those in charge recognized that non-diplomatic activities are being undertaken and announced that this diplomat should leave the soil of the islamic republic of iran , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini told a news conference .
a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .
the hamburg-based weekly der spiegel reported last month that berlin had previously expelled an iranian diplomat in july after he allegedly sought to purchase equipment for his country 's controversial nuclear program .
the man , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reportedly in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria in an apparent attempt to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment the german foreign ministry declined to comment at the time .
western nations have been pushing for iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could potentially lead to the production of atomic weapons and their placement in the hands of fundamentalists .
tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
vital interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel sees iran as a challenge for germany 's foreign policy in a recent article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , german chancellor merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community .
she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous .
" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

reformists hope to mend ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes meanwhile , iran 's reformist politicians pledged on saturday to put an end to the ongoing crisis in relations with the west if they win the upcoming parliamentary elections .
" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .
registration for parliamentary elections state television said prospective candidates started registering to stand in the election for the 290-seat parliament throughout the islamic republic .
hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .
all candidates , however , have to be approved by the hardline unelected guardians council , which has the right to disqualify any candidate it deems to be insufficiently qualified .

vital interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel sees iran as a challenge for germany 's foreign policy in a recent article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , german chancellor merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community .
she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous .
" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

reformists hope to mend ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes meanwhile , iran 's reformist politicians pledged on saturday to put an end to the ongoing crisis in relations with the west if they win the upcoming parliamentary elections .
" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .
registration for parliamentary elections state television said prospective candidates started registering to stand in the election for the 290-seat parliament throughout the islamic republic .
hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .
all candidates , however , have to be approved by the hardline unelected guardians council , which has the right to disqualify any candidate it deems to be insufficiently qualified .

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .
makatsch to star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say heike makatsch bears a resemblance to knef in the film about her life , she will be played by german actress heike makatsch , who was recently awarded a german film prize for her lead role performance in another biographical picture about margarete steiff , the wheelchair-bound founder of a famous german teddy bear manufacturing company .
knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .
makatsch , who many say bears a striking resemblance to knef , should also be able to relate to her character since she - despite flirting with hollywood success - remains a much bigger name in the german-speaking world . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , in the fragile serbian ruling coalition when deputy prime minister djelic negated prime minister kostunica 's warning to the eu that it must choose between serbia and kosovo . kostunica on thursday said that belgrade would not sign a stabilization and association agreement with the eu if brussels sends its civil mission to serbia 's breakaway province kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian deputy prime minister bozidar djelic -lrb- left -rrb- is pushing serbia in the direction of the eu but daily blic in its saturday edition quoted djelic , who was on a visit to israel , as saying that serbia would certainly sign the agreement if the offer is made .
" yes , we will sign if eu invites us , " said djelic , a top official of the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
kosovo , backed by the united states and most eu countries , is preparing to declare independence from serbia within months .
the eu plans to send a law-enforcing mission of 1,800 police , customs and judicial officials to help kosovo 's first steps as an independent state .
" the eu will ... have to choose whether it would sign a stabilization and association agreement with serbia or send its civil mission to kosovo , " said kostunica , who heads the nationalist democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- .
election tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president tadic -lrb- right -rrb- and prime minister kostunica do n't agree about much ds and dss are also at odds over the upcoming presidential election , in which kostunica has refused to back the ds chief and incumbent boris tadic , who is strongly challenged by the ultra-nationalist leader tomislav nikolic .
the first round of the election is on jan .
20 , while the certain run-off between tadic and nikolic is expected on feb .
3 .
brussels , which so far did not react to kostunica 's statement , may invite serbia to sign the stabilization and association agreement - a significant step towards membership of the eu - on january 28 .
it is also expected that kosovo may declare independence shortly after the serbian presidential run-off and that the move would be followed by a series of recognitions from western powers in spite of vehement opposition from russia .
parliament for independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashim thaci is promising nothing less than independence meanwhile , the new kosovo parliament met on friday for its first session after nov .
17 elections , meeting a legal deadline but still without an agreement on a ruling coalition which would lead the breakaway serbian province to independence .
the new legislators were sworn in and administrative committees appointed , averting a crisis , but parliament adjourned until jan .
9 without naming a speaker .
that signals that the anticipated alliance of the two largest parties remains elusive , despite the paramount agenda of declaring kosovo 's secession from serbia .
designated prime minister hashim thaci 's democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- won the most seats , 37 , in the assembly of 120 .
he had been widely expected to ally with the late independence icon ibrahim rugova 's democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , which has 25 seats .
thaci , however , promised a government " by next wednesday " and a proclamation of independence by the new assembly .
" we have now the new parliament for the independence o kosovo , " thaci said .
" it 's a joint commitment of ours and of our western partners to cooperate closely ... finish as soon as possible the status process and make our country independent and sovereign .

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .
makatsch to star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say heike makatsch bears a resemblance to knef in the film about her life , she will be played by german actress heike makatsch , who was recently awarded a german film prize for her lead role performance in another biographical picture about margarete steiff , the wheelchair-bound founder of a famous german teddy bear manufacturing company .
knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .
makatsch , who many say bears a striking resemblance to knef , should also be able to relate to her character since she - despite flirting with hollywood success - remains a much bigger name in the german-speaking world . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that reflects the fact that the bundesliga is packed with midfielder talent .
but the strikers are n't bad either . strikers most german fans may have liked bayern 's miroslav klose better when he was plying his trade for over-achievers bremen .
but he remains the league 's premier striker -lrb- nine goals -rrb- and a team-oriented player -lrb- six assists -rrb- .
and with this summer 's european championship fast approaching , expect the german international to continuing using league matches to test his range .
bochum 's stanislav sestak faced a difficult task this season - replacing last year 's leading goal scorer theofanis gekas .
and with eight goals and seven assists , he 's passed that test with flying colors .
the slovakian has had few problems adjusting to the bundesliga and is a main reason bochum are spending the winter outside the relegation zone .

rafael van der vaart made negative headlines this summer with an attempt to force a transfer from hamburg .
but since he 's backed off his demands for a move , he 's led his side back into the top three , scoring nine goals in the process .
the only problem for hamburg is that there are now even more , bigger foreign clubs coveting the dutchman 's services .
with four goals and three assists , bayern 's franck ribery has n't posted quite the numbers as his opposite numbers in bremen and hamburg .

5 , for tougher action against juvenile offenders and steps to make it easier to deport foreign criminals from the country . the call was contained in a resolution adopted at a meeting of the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as a debate raged on youth crime ahead of elections in two federal states later this month . the cdu wants the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences to be increased from 10 to 15 years and a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes . foreigners given a sentence of one year or more would be liable to deportation under the proposals , which also seek the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education . boot camps as a deterrent previously , merkel said she was in favor of boot camps and courts handing brief custodial sentences designed to act as a deterrent to juveniles given probation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .
hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras recorded the attack on a 76-year-old man in munich after the attack in munich , juvenile delinquency has shot to the top of the german political agenda , with some of merkel 's fellow christian democrats calling for a sharp clampdown .
earlier in the week , merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the government was considering if crime laws had to be toughened .
but he said the issues also included improving education and the integration of minorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner society -pipe- 05.01.2008 german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her party believe that boot camps would help young people not end up in jail german chancellor angela merkel 's party called on saturday , dec .
5 , for tougher action against juvenile offenders and steps to make it easier to deport foreign criminals from the country . the call was contained in a resolution adopted at a meeting of the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as a debate raged on youth crime ahead of elections in two federal states later this month . the cdu wants the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences to be increased from 10 to 15 years and a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes . foreigners given a sentence of one year or more would be liable to deportation under the proposals , which also seek the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education . boot camps as a deterrent previously , merkel said she was in favor of boot camps and courts handing brief custodial sentences designed to act as a deterrent to juveniles given probation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .
hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras recorded the attack on a 76-year-old man in munich after the attack in munich , juvenile delinquency has shot to the top of the german political agenda , with some of merkel 's fellow christian democrats calling for a sharp clampdown .
earlier in the week , merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the government was considering if crime laws had to be toughened .
but he said the issues also included improving education and the integration of minorities .
munich police are holding a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national on attempted-murder charges for kicking and punching a retired school principal , 76 , who had asked them to obey a ban on smoking in an underground station on dec .
20 .
opposing voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boot camps , like this one in the us , may become more visible in germany a perception of widespread violence by youths , many of them born in germany but descended from " guest workers " - migrants who settled in germany in the 1960s - has triggered the debate about ethnic crime .
the most prominent voice was raised by roland koch , the state premier of hesse and member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ahead of the state elections on jan .
27 .
koch said last week there were " too many criminal foreigners " in germany and this week unveiled a six-point plan calling for a crackdown on delinquents , including more detention instead of fines .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , accused koch of playing the race card in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders .
but the chancellor defended koch , saying youth crime was a justified election issue because 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people under 21 , almost half of whom have immigrant backgrounds . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue conservative politicians in the state of hesse are latching on to the issue of how to deal with crime committed by young foreigners to score points with voters in a key regional election later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner society -pipe- 05.01.2008 german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her party believe that boot camps would help young people not end up in jail german chancellor angela merkel 's party called on saturday , dec .
5 , for tougher action against juvenile offenders and steps to make it easier to deport foreign criminals from the country . the call was contained in a resolution adopted at a meeting of the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as a debate raged on youth crime ahead of elections in two federal states later this month . the cdu wants the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences to be increased from 10 to 15 years and a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes . foreigners given a sentence of one year or more would be liable to deportation under the proposals , which also seek the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education . boot camps as a deterrent previously , merkel said she was in favor of boot camps and courts handing brief custodial sentences designed to act as a deterrent to juveniles given probation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .
hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras recorded the attack on a 76-year-old man in munich after the attack in munich , juvenile delinquency has shot to the top of the german political agenda , with some of merkel 's fellow christian democrats calling for a sharp clampdown .
earlier in the week , merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the government was considering if crime laws had to be toughened .
but he said the issues also included improving education and the integration of minorities .
munich police are holding a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national on attempted-murder charges for kicking and punching a retired school principal , 76 , who had asked them to obey a ban on smoking in an underground station on dec .
20 .
opposing voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boot camps , like this one in the us , may become more visible in germany a perception of widespread violence by youths , many of them born in germany but descended from " guest workers " - migrants who settled in germany in the 1960s - has triggered the debate about ethnic crime .
the most prominent voice was raised by roland koch , the state premier of hesse and member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ahead of the state elections on jan .
27 .
koch said last week there were " too many criminal foreigners " in germany and this week unveiled a six-point plan calling for a crackdown on delinquents , including more detention instead of fines .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , accused koch of playing the race card in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders .
but the chancellor defended koch , saying youth crime was a justified election issue because 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people under 21 , almost half of whom have immigrant backgrounds . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue conservative politicians in the state of hesse are latching on to the issue of how to deal with crime committed by young foreigners to score points with voters in a key regional election later this month .

5 , in the fragile serbian ruling coalition when deputy prime minister djelic negated prime minister kostunica 's warning to the eu that it must choose between serbia and kosovo . kostunica on thursday said that belgrade would not sign a stabilization and association agreement with the eu if brussels sends its civil mission to serbia 's breakaway province kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian deputy prime minister bozidar djelic -lrb- left -rrb- is pushing serbia in the direction of the eu but daily blic in its saturday edition quoted djelic , who was on a visit to israel , as saying that serbia would certainly sign the agreement if the offer is made .
" yes , we will sign if eu invites us , " said djelic , a top official of the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
kosovo , backed by the united states and most eu countries , is preparing to declare independence from serbia within months .
the eu plans to send a law-enforcing mission of 1,800 police , customs and judicial officials to help kosovo 's first steps as an independent state .
" the eu will ... have to choose whether it would sign a stabilization and association agreement with serbia or send its civil mission to kosovo , " said kostunica , who heads the nationalist democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- .
election tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president tadic -lrb- right -rrb- and prime minister kostunica do n't agree about much ds and dss are also at odds over the upcoming presidential election , in which kostunica has refused to back the ds chief and incumbent boris tadic , who is strongly challenged by the ultra-nationalist leader tomislav nikolic .
the first round of the election is on jan .
20 , while the certain run-off between tadic and nikolic is expected on feb .
3 .

that reflects the fact that the bundesliga is packed with midfielder talent .
but the strikers are n't bad either . strikers most german fans may have liked bayern 's miroslav klose better when he was plying his trade for over-achievers bremen .
but he remains the league 's premier striker -lrb- nine goals -rrb- and a team-oriented player -lrb- six assists -rrb- .
and with this summer 's european championship fast approaching , expect the german international to continuing using league matches to test his range .
bochum 's stanislav sestak faced a difficult task this season - replacing last year 's leading goal scorer theofanis gekas .
and with eight goals and seven assists , he 's passed that test with flying colors .
the slovakian has had few problems adjusting to the bundesliga and is a main reason bochum are spending the winter outside the relegation zone .

with nine goals and seven assists , he 's the league 's most potent offensive threat .
but what was even more impressive was how he led the team through a potentially disastrous rash of early injuries to a spot atop the table , tied on points with bayern .
rafael van der vaart made negative headlines this summer with an attempt to force a transfer from hamburg .
but since he 's backed off his demands for a move , he 's led his side back into the top three , scoring nine goals in the process .
the only problem for hamburg is that there are now even more , bigger foreign clubs coveting the dutchman 's services .
with four goals and three assists , bayern 's franck ribery has n't posted quite the numbers as his opposite numbers in bremen and hamburg .
but the statistics in this case are deceptive since the role of this one-man highlight reel has been to break down defenses and leave his teammates to do the mopping up .
and that 's been crucial as the rest of bayern 's midfield has disappointed .

with all this midfield firepower , we should n't neglect the important job of protecting the backline while moving the ball up-field .
and leverkusen 's simon rolfes fits the bill to a tee .
the german soccer magazine kicker rates him as the league 's most effective player , and he 's featured in all but three minutes of his side 's bundesliga matches .
he 's also been excellent in the uefa cup , notching up one goal and four assists in the tournament .
honorable mention : david jarolim -lrb- hamburg -rrb- , sergei barbarez -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , daniel jensen -lrb- bremen -rrb- defense bayern have far and away the stingiest defense of the league , having only conceded eight goals in 17 games .
and the anchor of their back-line has been oft-ignored martin demichelis .
expected to be a substitute , the argentine has established himself in munich 's starting 11 and has only picked up two yellow cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers know there 's no messing with schalke 's bordon schalke have had an up-and-down year , but their solid work at the back has put them - albeit just barely - in the top five .
marcelo bordon has set the bone-crunching tone .
he was also instrumental in getting the royal blues into the knock-out stage of the champions league for the first time in club history .
with 13 goals conceded , hamburg have the league 's second best defense .
and joris mathijsen has been part of that bulwark for every single minute of his club 's campaigns in both the bundesliga and the uefa cup .
the dutchman 's consistency has been crucial in preserving a number of narrow hamburg wins .

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .
makatsch to star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say heike makatsch bears a resemblance to knef in the film about her life , she will be played by german actress heike makatsch , who was recently awarded a german film prize for her lead role performance in another biographical picture about margarete steiff , the wheelchair-bound founder of a famous german teddy bear manufacturing company .
knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .
makatsch , who many say bears a striking resemblance to knef , should also be able to relate to her character since she - despite flirting with hollywood success - remains a much bigger name in the german-speaking world . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .

but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .

knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner society -pipe- 05.01.2008 german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her party believe that boot camps would help young people not end up in jail german chancellor angela merkel 's party called on saturday , dec .
5 , for tougher action against juvenile offenders and steps to make it easier to deport foreign criminals from the country . the call was contained in a resolution adopted at a meeting of the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as a debate raged on youth crime ahead of elections in two federal states later this month . the cdu wants the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences to be increased from 10 to 15 years and a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes . foreigners given a sentence of one year or more would be liable to deportation under the proposals , which also seek the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education . boot camps as a deterrent previously , merkel said she was in favor of boot camps and courts handing brief custodial sentences designed to act as a deterrent to juveniles given probation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .
hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras recorded the attack on a 76-year-old man in munich after the attack in munich , juvenile delinquency has shot to the top of the german political agenda , with some of merkel 's fellow christian democrats calling for a sharp clampdown .
earlier in the week , merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the government was considering if crime laws had to be toughened .
but he said the issues also included improving education and the integration of minorities .
munich police are holding a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national on attempted-murder charges for kicking and punching a retired school principal , 76 , who had asked them to obey a ban on smoking in an underground station on dec .
20 .
opposing voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boot camps , like this one in the us , may become more visible in germany a perception of widespread violence by youths , many of them born in germany but descended from " guest workers " - migrants who settled in germany in the 1960s - has triggered the debate about ethnic crime .
the most prominent voice was raised by roland koch , the state premier of hesse and member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ahead of the state elections on jan .

honorable mention : luca toni -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , marko pantelic -lrb- hertha berlin -rrb- midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego is the league 's most valuable player many bundesliga sides seem to believe that games are won and lost in midfield , and heading the pack is bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego .
with nine goals and seven assists , he 's the league 's most potent offensive threat .
but what was even more impressive was how he led the team through a potentially disastrous rash of early injuries to a spot atop the table , tied on points with bayern .
rafael van der vaart made negative headlines this summer with an attempt to force a transfer from hamburg .
but since he 's backed off his demands for a move , he 's led his side back into the top three , scoring nine goals in the process .
the only problem for hamburg is that there are now even more , bigger foreign clubs coveting the dutchman 's services .
with four goals and three assists , bayern 's franck ribery has n't posted quite the numbers as his opposite numbers in bremen and hamburg .
but the statistics in this case are deceptive since the role of this one-man highlight reel has been to break down defenses and leave his teammates to do the mopping up .
and that 's been crucial as the rest of bayern 's midfield has disappointed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery -lrb- r . -rrb- has been the sole source of esprit in bayern 's midfield newly promoted karlsruhe are sitting pretty in sixth place this winter , and that 's due in large measure to tamas hajnal .
the hungarian international has scored five goals and set up teammates with six assists while holding together a squad that has given much bigger opponents fits this season .
now many of those opponents are lining up the steal this expert poacher away from karlsruhe next season .
with all this midfield firepower , we should n't neglect the important job of protecting the backline while moving the ball up-field .
and leverkusen 's simon rolfes fits the bill to a tee .
the german soccer magazine kicker rates him as the league 's most effective player , and he 's featured in all but three minutes of his side 's bundesliga matches .
he 's also been excellent in the uefa cup , notching up one goal and four assists in the tournament .
honorable mention : david jarolim -lrb- hamburg -rrb- , sergei barbarez -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , daniel jensen -lrb- bremen -rrb- defense bayern have far and away the stingiest defense of the league , having only conceded eight goals in 17 games .
and the anchor of their back-line has been oft-ignored martin demichelis .
expected to be a substitute , the argentine has established himself in munich 's starting 11 and has only picked up two yellow cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers know there 's no messing with schalke 's bordon schalke have had an up-and-down year , but their solid work at the back has put them - albeit just barely - in the top five .
marcelo bordon has set the bone-crunching tone .
he was also instrumental in getting the royal blues into the knock-out stage of the champions league for the first time in club history .
with 13 goals conceded , hamburg have the league 's second best defense .
and joris mathijsen has been part of that bulwark for every single minute of his club 's campaigns in both the bundesliga and the uefa cup .
the dutchman 's consistency has been crucial in preserving a number of narrow hamburg wins .
honorable mention : per mertesacker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mario eggimann -lrb- karlsruhe -rrb- , andreas wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler is making his case for inclusion in germany 's euro 2008 squad twenty-year-old rené adler of leverkusen has leapfrogged a host of young colleagues and older veterans to become tops in a league known for quality between the posts .
adler has let in only 16 goals this season , and few , if any , have been his fault .
he 's also a master of the long ball , the first element in leverkusen 's fast-break attack .

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2008 midfielders ruled in first half of bundesliga season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is still flying high after swapping bremen green for munich red this time round , dw-world.de has opted for a 3-5-2 formation in choosing our top 11 .
that reflects the fact that the bundesliga is packed with midfielder talent .
but the strikers are n't bad either . strikers most german fans may have liked bayern 's miroslav klose better when he was plying his trade for over-achievers bremen .
but he remains the league 's premier striker -lrb- nine goals -rrb- and a team-oriented player -lrb- six assists -rrb- .
and with this summer 's european championship fast approaching , expect the german international to continuing using league matches to test his range .
bochum 's stanislav sestak faced a difficult task this season - replacing last year 's leading goal scorer theofanis gekas .
and with eight goals and seven assists , he 's passed that test with flying colors .
the slovakian has had few problems adjusting to the bundesliga and is a main reason bochum are spending the winter outside the relegation zone .
honorable mention : luca toni -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , marko pantelic -lrb- hertha berlin -rrb- midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego is the league 's most valuable player many bundesliga sides seem to believe that games are won and lost in midfield , and heading the pack is bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego .
with nine goals and seven assists , he 's the league 's most potent offensive threat .
but what was even more impressive was how he led the team through a potentially disastrous rash of early injuries to a spot atop the table , tied on points with bayern .
rafael van der vaart made negative headlines this summer with an attempt to force a transfer from hamburg .
but since he 's backed off his demands for a move , he 's led his side back into the top three , scoring nine goals in the process .
the only problem for hamburg is that there are now even more , bigger foreign clubs coveting the dutchman 's services .
with four goals and three assists , bayern 's franck ribery has n't posted quite the numbers as his opposite numbers in bremen and hamburg .
but the statistics in this case are deceptive since the role of this one-man highlight reel has been to break down defenses and leave his teammates to do the mopping up .
and that 's been crucial as the rest of bayern 's midfield has disappointed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery -lrb- r . -rrb- has been the sole source of esprit in bayern 's midfield newly promoted karlsruhe are sitting pretty in sixth place this winter , and that 's due in large measure to tamas hajnal .
the hungarian international has scored five goals and set up teammates with six assists while holding together a squad that has given much bigger opponents fits this season .
now many of those opponents are lining up the steal this expert poacher away from karlsruhe next season .
with all this midfield firepower , we should n't neglect the important job of protecting the backline while moving the ball up-field .
and leverkusen 's simon rolfes fits the bill to a tee .
the german soccer magazine kicker rates him as the league 's most effective player , and he 's featured in all but three minutes of his side 's bundesliga matches .
he 's also been excellent in the uefa cup , notching up one goal and four assists in the tournament .
honorable mention : david jarolim -lrb- hamburg -rrb- , sergei barbarez -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , daniel jensen -lrb- bremen -rrb- defense bayern have far and away the stingiest defense of the league , having only conceded eight goals in 17 games .
and the anchor of their back-line has been oft-ignored martin demichelis .
expected to be a substitute , the argentine has established himself in munich 's starting 11 and has only picked up two yellow cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers know there 's no messing with schalke 's bordon schalke have had an up-and-down year , but their solid work at the back has put them - albeit just barely - in the top five .
marcelo bordon has set the bone-crunching tone .
he was also instrumental in getting the royal blues into the knock-out stage of the champions league for the first time in club history .
with 13 goals conceded , hamburg have the league 's second best defense .
and joris mathijsen has been part of that bulwark for every single minute of his club 's campaigns in both the bundesliga and the uefa cup .
the dutchman 's consistency has been crucial in preserving a number of narrow hamburg wins .
honorable mention : per mertesacker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mario eggimann -lrb- karlsruhe -rrb- , andreas wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler is making his case for inclusion in germany 's euro 2008 squad twenty-year-old rené adler of leverkusen has leapfrogged a host of young colleagues and older veterans to become tops in a league known for quality between the posts .
adler has let in only 16 goals this season , and few , if any , have been his fault .
he 's also a master of the long ball , the first element in leverkusen 's fast-break attack .

dw-world.de world class stars aiding bundesliga 's rehabilitation when bayern munich bought some of the world 's most wanted players , it looked like game over .
but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars .
-lrb- 24.12.2007 -rrb- german sides advance in uefa cup german soccer fans will have plenty of teams to cheer for in the uefa cup .

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .
makatsch to star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say heike makatsch bears a resemblance to knef in the film about her life , she will be played by german actress heike makatsch , who was recently awarded a german film prize for her lead role performance in another biographical picture about margarete steiff , the wheelchair-bound founder of a famous german teddy bear manufacturing company .
knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .
makatsch , who many say bears a striking resemblance to knef , should also be able to relate to her character since she - despite flirting with hollywood success - remains a much bigger name in the german-speaking world . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that reflects the fact that the bundesliga is packed with midfielder talent .
but the strikers are n't bad either . strikers most german fans may have liked bayern 's miroslav klose better when he was plying his trade for over-achievers bremen .
but he remains the league 's premier striker -lrb- nine goals -rrb- and a team-oriented player -lrb- six assists -rrb- .
and with this summer 's european championship fast approaching , expect the german international to continuing using league matches to test his range .
bochum 's stanislav sestak faced a difficult task this season - replacing last year 's leading goal scorer theofanis gekas .
and with eight goals and seven assists , he 's passed that test with flying colors .
the slovakian has had few problems adjusting to the bundesliga and is a main reason bochum are spending the winter outside the relegation zone .
honorable mention : luca toni -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , marko pantelic -lrb- hertha berlin -rrb- midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego is the league 's most valuable player many bundesliga sides seem to believe that games are won and lost in midfield , and heading the pack is bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego .
with nine goals and seven assists , he 's the league 's most potent offensive threat .
but what was even more impressive was how he led the team through a potentially disastrous rash of early injuries to a spot atop the table , tied on points with bayern .
rafael van der vaart made negative headlines this summer with an attempt to force a transfer from hamburg .
but since he 's backed off his demands for a move , he 's led his side back into the top three , scoring nine goals in the process .
the only problem for hamburg is that there are now even more , bigger foreign clubs coveting the dutchman 's services .
with four goals and three assists , bayern 's franck ribery has n't posted quite the numbers as his opposite numbers in bremen and hamburg .
but the statistics in this case are deceptive since the role of this one-man highlight reel has been to break down defenses and leave his teammates to do the mopping up .
and that 's been crucial as the rest of bayern 's midfield has disappointed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery -lrb- r . -rrb- has been the sole source of esprit in bayern 's midfield newly promoted karlsruhe are sitting pretty in sixth place this winter , and that 's due in large measure to tamas hajnal .
the hungarian international has scored five goals and set up teammates with six assists while holding together a squad that has given much bigger opponents fits this season .
now many of those opponents are lining up the steal this expert poacher away from karlsruhe next season .
with all this midfield firepower , we should n't neglect the important job of protecting the backline while moving the ball up-field .
and leverkusen 's simon rolfes fits the bill to a tee .
the german soccer magazine kicker rates him as the league 's most effective player , and he 's featured in all but three minutes of his side 's bundesliga matches .
he 's also been excellent in the uefa cup , notching up one goal and four assists in the tournament .
honorable mention : david jarolim -lrb- hamburg -rrb- , sergei barbarez -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , daniel jensen -lrb- bremen -rrb- defense bayern have far and away the stingiest defense of the league , having only conceded eight goals in 17 games .
and the anchor of their back-line has been oft-ignored martin demichelis .
expected to be a substitute , the argentine has established himself in munich 's starting 11 and has only picked up two yellow cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers know there 's no messing with schalke 's bordon schalke have had an up-and-down year , but their solid work at the back has put them - albeit just barely - in the top five .
marcelo bordon has set the bone-crunching tone .
he was also instrumental in getting the royal blues into the knock-out stage of the champions league for the first time in club history .
with 13 goals conceded , hamburg have the league 's second best defense .
and joris mathijsen has been part of that bulwark for every single minute of his club 's campaigns in both the bundesliga and the uefa cup .
the dutchman 's consistency has been crucial in preserving a number of narrow hamburg wins .
honorable mention : per mertesacker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mario eggimann -lrb- karlsruhe -rrb- , andreas wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler is making his case for inclusion in germany 's euro 2008 squad twenty-year-old rené adler of leverkusen has leapfrogged a host of young colleagues and older veterans to become tops in a league known for quality between the posts .
adler has let in only 16 goals this season , and few , if any , have been his fault .

5 , for tougher action against juvenile offenders and steps to make it easier to deport foreign criminals from the country . the call was contained in a resolution adopted at a meeting of the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as a debate raged on youth crime ahead of elections in two federal states later this month . the cdu wants the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences to be increased from 10 to 15 years and a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes . foreigners given a sentence of one year or more would be liable to deportation under the proposals , which also seek the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education . boot camps as a deterrent previously , merkel said she was in favor of boot camps and courts handing brief custodial sentences designed to act as a deterrent to juveniles given probation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .
hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras recorded the attack on a 76-year-old man in munich after the attack in munich , juvenile delinquency has shot to the top of the german political agenda , with some of merkel 's fellow christian democrats calling for a sharp clampdown .
earlier in the week , merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the government was considering if crime laws had to be toughened .
but he said the issues also included improving education and the integration of minorities .
munich police are holding a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national on attempted-murder charges for kicking and punching a retired school principal , 76 , who had asked them to obey a ban on smoking in an underground station on dec .
20 .
opposing voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boot camps , like this one in the us , may become more visible in germany a perception of widespread violence by youths , many of them born in germany but descended from " guest workers " - migrants who settled in germany in the 1960s - has triggered the debate about ethnic crime .
the most prominent voice was raised by roland koch , the state premier of hesse and member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ahead of the state elections on jan .
27 .
koch said last week there were " too many criminal foreigners " in germany and this week unveiled a six-point plan calling for a crackdown on delinquents , including more detention instead of fines .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , accused koch of playing the race card in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders .
but the chancellor defended koch , saying youth crime was a justified election issue because 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people under 21 , almost half of whom have immigrant backgrounds . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue conservative politicians in the state of hesse are latching on to the issue of how to deal with crime committed by young foreigners to score points with voters in a key regional election later this month .
-lrb- 02.01.2008 -rrb- reformed citizenship laws pose dilemma for young germans reformed citizenship laws mean that , starting this year , young germans with immigrant backgrounds who have thus far had dual citizenship will have to choose between being a german or a foreigner .

" those in charge recognized that non-diplomatic activities are being undertaken and announced that this diplomat should leave the soil of the islamic republic of iran , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini told a news conference .
a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .
the hamburg-based weekly der spiegel reported last month that berlin had previously expelled an iranian diplomat in july after he allegedly sought to purchase equipment for his country 's controversial nuclear program .
the man , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reportedly in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria in an apparent attempt to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment the german foreign ministry declined to comment at the time .
western nations have been pushing for iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could potentially lead to the production of atomic weapons and their placement in the hands of fundamentalists .
tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
vital interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel sees iran as a challenge for germany 's foreign policy in a recent article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , german chancellor merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community .
she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous .
" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

reformists hope to mend ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes meanwhile , iran 's reformist politicians pledged on saturday to put an end to the ongoing crisis in relations with the west if they win the upcoming parliamentary elections .
" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .
registration for parliamentary elections state television said prospective candidates started registering to stand in the election for the 290-seat parliament throughout the islamic republic .
hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .

a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .
the hamburg-based weekly der spiegel reported last month that berlin had previously expelled an iranian diplomat in july after he allegedly sought to purchase equipment for his country 's controversial nuclear program .

" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner society -pipe- 05.01.2008 german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her party believe that boot camps would help young people not end up in jail german chancellor angela merkel 's party called on saturday , dec .
5 , for tougher action against juvenile offenders and steps to make it easier to deport foreign criminals from the country . the call was contained in a resolution adopted at a meeting of the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as a debate raged on youth crime ahead of elections in two federal states later this month . the cdu wants the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences to be increased from 10 to 15 years and a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes . foreigners given a sentence of one year or more would be liable to deportation under the proposals , which also seek the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education . boot camps as a deterrent previously , merkel said she was in favor of boot camps and courts handing brief custodial sentences designed to act as a deterrent to juveniles given probation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .
hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras recorded the attack on a 76-year-old man in munich after the attack in munich , juvenile delinquency has shot to the top of the german political agenda , with some of merkel 's fellow christian democrats calling for a sharp clampdown .
earlier in the week , merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the government was considering if crime laws had to be toughened .
but he said the issues also included improving education and the integration of minorities .
munich police are holding a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national on attempted-murder charges for kicking and punching a retired school principal , 76 , who had asked them to obey a ban on smoking in an underground station on dec .
20 .
opposing voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boot camps , like this one in the us , may become more visible in germany a perception of widespread violence by youths , many of them born in germany but descended from " guest workers " - migrants who settled in germany in the 1960s - has triggered the debate about ethnic crime .
the most prominent voice was raised by roland koch , the state premier of hesse and member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ahead of the state elections on jan .
27 .
koch said last week there were " too many criminal foreigners " in germany and this week unveiled a six-point plan calling for a crackdown on delinquents , including more detention instead of fines .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , accused koch of playing the race card in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders .
but the chancellor defended koch , saying youth crime was a justified election issue because 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people under 21 , almost half of whom have immigrant backgrounds . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue conservative politicians in the state of hesse are latching on to the issue of how to deal with crime committed by young foreigners to score points with voters in a key regional election later this month .
-lrb- 02.01.2008 -rrb- reformed citizenship laws pose dilemma for young germans reformed citizenship laws mean that , starting this year , young germans with immigrant backgrounds who have thus far had dual citizenship will have to choose between being a german or a foreigner .

5 , in the fragile serbian ruling coalition when deputy prime minister djelic negated prime minister kostunica 's warning to the eu that it must choose between serbia and kosovo . kostunica on thursday said that belgrade would not sign a stabilization and association agreement with the eu if brussels sends its civil mission to serbia 's breakaway province kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian deputy prime minister bozidar djelic -lrb- left -rrb- is pushing serbia in the direction of the eu but daily blic in its saturday edition quoted djelic , who was on a visit to israel , as saying that serbia would certainly sign the agreement if the offer is made .
" yes , we will sign if eu invites us , " said djelic , a top official of the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
kosovo , backed by the united states and most eu countries , is preparing to declare independence from serbia within months .
the eu plans to send a law-enforcing mission of 1,800 police , customs and judicial officials to help kosovo 's first steps as an independent state .
" the eu will ... have to choose whether it would sign a stabilization and association agreement with serbia or send its civil mission to kosovo , " said kostunica , who heads the nationalist democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- .
election tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president tadic -lrb- right -rrb- and prime minister kostunica do n't agree about much ds and dss are also at odds over the upcoming presidential election , in which kostunica has refused to back the ds chief and incumbent boris tadic , who is strongly challenged by the ultra-nationalist leader tomislav nikolic .
the first round of the election is on jan .
20 , while the certain run-off between tadic and nikolic is expected on feb .
3 .
brussels , which so far did not react to kostunica 's statement , may invite serbia to sign the stabilization and association agreement - a significant step towards membership of the eu - on january 28 .
it is also expected that kosovo may declare independence shortly after the serbian presidential run-off and that the move would be followed by a series of recognitions from western powers in spite of vehement opposition from russia .
parliament for independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashim thaci is promising nothing less than independence meanwhile , the new kosovo parliament met on friday for its first session after nov .
17 elections , meeting a legal deadline but still without an agreement on a ruling coalition which would lead the breakaway serbian province to independence .
the new legislators were sworn in and administrative committees appointed , averting a crisis , but parliament adjourned until jan .
9 without naming a speaker .
that signals that the anticipated alliance of the two largest parties remains elusive , despite the paramount agenda of declaring kosovo 's secession from serbia .
designated prime minister hashim thaci 's democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- won the most seats , 37 , in the assembly of 120 .
he had been widely expected to ally with the late independence icon ibrahim rugova 's democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , which has 25 seats .
thaci , however , promised a government " by next wednesday " and a proclamation of independence by the new assembly .
" we have now the new parliament for the independence o kosovo , " thaci said .

a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .
the hamburg-based weekly der spiegel reported last month that berlin had previously expelled an iranian diplomat in july after he allegedly sought to purchase equipment for his country 's controversial nuclear program .
the man , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reportedly in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria in an apparent attempt to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment the german foreign ministry declined to comment at the time .

" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .
registration for parliamentary elections state television said prospective candidates started registering to stand in the election for the 290-seat parliament throughout the islamic republic .
hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .

hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .
all candidates , however , have to be approved by the hardline unelected guardians council , which has the right to disqualify any candidate it deems to be insufficiently qualified .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.01.2008 german diplomat ousted from iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains concerned about iran 's nuclear ambitions iran has expelled a german diplomat for " non-diplomatic activities , " the iranian foreign ministry said on sunday , dec .
6 , in an incident apparently related to the expulsion by germany of an iranian diplomat last summer . " those in charge recognized that non-diplomatic activities are being undertaken and announced that this diplomat should leave the soil of the islamic republic of iran , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini told a news conference .
a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .
the hamburg-based weekly der spiegel reported last month that berlin had previously expelled an iranian diplomat in july after he allegedly sought to purchase equipment for his country 's controversial nuclear program .
the man , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reportedly in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria in an apparent attempt to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment the german foreign ministry declined to comment at the time .
western nations have been pushing for iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could potentially lead to the production of atomic weapons and their placement in the hands of fundamentalists .
tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
vital interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel sees iran as a challenge for germany 's foreign policy in a recent article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , german chancellor merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community .
she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous .
" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

reformists hope to mend ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes meanwhile , iran 's reformist politicians pledged on saturday to put an end to the ongoing crisis in relations with the west if they win the upcoming parliamentary elections .
" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .
registration for parliamentary elections state television said prospective candidates started registering to stand in the election for the 290-seat parliament throughout the islamic republic .
hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .

" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .
makatsch to star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say heike makatsch bears a resemblance to knef in the film about her life , she will be played by german actress heike makatsch , who was recently awarded a german film prize for her lead role performance in another biographical picture about margarete steiff , the wheelchair-bound founder of a famous german teddy bear manufacturing company .
knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .
makatsch to star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say heike makatsch bears a resemblance to knef in the film about her life , she will be played by german actress heike makatsch , who was recently awarded a german film prize for her lead role performance in another biographical picture about margarete steiff , the wheelchair-bound founder of a famous german teddy bear manufacturing company .
knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .
makatsch , who many say bears a striking resemblance to knef , should also be able to relate to her character since she - despite flirting with hollywood success - remains a much bigger name in the german-speaking world . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , in the fragile serbian ruling coalition when deputy prime minister djelic negated prime minister kostunica 's warning to the eu that it must choose between serbia and kosovo . kostunica on thursday said that belgrade would not sign a stabilization and association agreement with the eu if brussels sends its civil mission to serbia 's breakaway province kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian deputy prime minister bozidar djelic -lrb- left -rrb- is pushing serbia in the direction of the eu but daily blic in its saturday edition quoted djelic , who was on a visit to israel , as saying that serbia would certainly sign the agreement if the offer is made .
" yes , we will sign if eu invites us , " said djelic , a top official of the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
kosovo , backed by the united states and most eu countries , is preparing to declare independence from serbia within months .
the eu plans to send a law-enforcing mission of 1,800 police , customs and judicial officials to help kosovo 's first steps as an independent state .
" the eu will ... have to choose whether it would sign a stabilization and association agreement with serbia or send its civil mission to kosovo , " said kostunica , who heads the nationalist democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- .
election tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president tadic -lrb- right -rrb- and prime minister kostunica do n't agree about much ds and dss are also at odds over the upcoming presidential election , in which kostunica has refused to back the ds chief and incumbent boris tadic , who is strongly challenged by the ultra-nationalist leader tomislav nikolic .
the first round of the election is on jan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .

koch said last week there were " too many criminal foreigners " in germany and this week unveiled a six-point plan calling for a crackdown on delinquents , including more detention instead of fines .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , accused koch of playing the race card in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders .

a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .

" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .

6 , in an incident apparently related to the expulsion by germany of an iranian diplomat last summer . " those in charge recognized that non-diplomatic activities are being undertaken and announced that this diplomat should leave the soil of the islamic republic of iran , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini told a news conference .
a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .
the hamburg-based weekly der spiegel reported last month that berlin had previously expelled an iranian diplomat in july after he allegedly sought to purchase equipment for his country 's controversial nuclear program .
the man , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reportedly in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria in an apparent attempt to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment the german foreign ministry declined to comment at the time .
western nations have been pushing for iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could potentially lead to the production of atomic weapons and their placement in the hands of fundamentalists .
tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
vital interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel sees iran as a challenge for germany 's foreign policy in a recent article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , german chancellor merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community .
she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous .
" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

reformists hope to mend ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes meanwhile , iran 's reformist politicians pledged on saturday to put an end to the ongoing crisis in relations with the west if they win the upcoming parliamentary elections .
" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .
registration for parliamentary elections state television said prospective candidates started registering to stand in the election for the 290-seat parliament throughout the islamic republic .
hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .
all candidates , however , have to be approved by the hardline unelected guardians council , which has the right to disqualify any candidate it deems to be insufficiently qualified .

that reflects the fact that the bundesliga is packed with midfielder talent .
but the strikers are n't bad either . strikers most german fans may have liked bayern 's miroslav klose better when he was plying his trade for over-achievers bremen .
but he remains the league 's premier striker -lrb- nine goals -rrb- and a team-oriented player -lrb- six assists -rrb- .
and with this summer 's european championship fast approaching , expect the german international to continuing using league matches to test his range .
bochum 's stanislav sestak faced a difficult task this season - replacing last year 's leading goal scorer theofanis gekas .
and with eight goals and seven assists , he 's passed that test with flying colors .
the slovakian has had few problems adjusting to the bundesliga and is a main reason bochum are spending the winter outside the relegation zone .
honorable mention : luca toni -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , marko pantelic -lrb- hertha berlin -rrb- midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego is the league 's most valuable player many bundesliga sides seem to believe that games are won and lost in midfield , and heading the pack is bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego .
with nine goals and seven assists , he 's the league 's most potent offensive threat .
but what was even more impressive was how he led the team through a potentially disastrous rash of early injuries to a spot atop the table , tied on points with bayern .
rafael van der vaart made negative headlines this summer with an attempt to force a transfer from hamburg .
but since he 's backed off his demands for a move , he 's led his side back into the top three , scoring nine goals in the process .
the only problem for hamburg is that there are now even more , bigger foreign clubs coveting the dutchman 's services .
with four goals and three assists , bayern 's franck ribery has n't posted quite the numbers as his opposite numbers in bremen and hamburg .
but the statistics in this case are deceptive since the role of this one-man highlight reel has been to break down defenses and leave his teammates to do the mopping up .
and that 's been crucial as the rest of bayern 's midfield has disappointed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery -lrb- r . -rrb- has been the sole source of esprit in bayern 's midfield newly promoted karlsruhe are sitting pretty in sixth place this winter , and that 's due in large measure to tamas hajnal .
the hungarian international has scored five goals and set up teammates with six assists while holding together a squad that has given much bigger opponents fits this season .
now many of those opponents are lining up the steal this expert poacher away from karlsruhe next season .
with all this midfield firepower , we should n't neglect the important job of protecting the backline while moving the ball up-field .
and leverkusen 's simon rolfes fits the bill to a tee .
the german soccer magazine kicker rates him as the league 's most effective player , and he 's featured in all but three minutes of his side 's bundesliga matches .
he 's also been excellent in the uefa cup , notching up one goal and four assists in the tournament .

5 , for tougher action against juvenile offenders and steps to make it easier to deport foreign criminals from the country . the call was contained in a resolution adopted at a meeting of the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as a debate raged on youth crime ahead of elections in two federal states later this month . the cdu wants the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences to be increased from 10 to 15 years and a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes . foreigners given a sentence of one year or more would be liable to deportation under the proposals , which also seek the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education . boot camps as a deterrent previously , merkel said she was in favor of boot camps and courts handing brief custodial sentences designed to act as a deterrent to juveniles given probation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .
hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras recorded the attack on a 76-year-old man in munich after the attack in munich , juvenile delinquency has shot to the top of the german political agenda , with some of merkel 's fellow christian democrats calling for a sharp clampdown .
earlier in the week , merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the government was considering if crime laws had to be toughened .
but he said the issues also included improving education and the integration of minorities .
munich police are holding a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national on attempted-murder charges for kicking and punching a retired school principal , 76 , who had asked them to obey a ban on smoking in an underground station on dec .

6 , in an incident apparently related to the expulsion by germany of an iranian diplomat last summer . " those in charge recognized that non-diplomatic activities are being undertaken and announced that this diplomat should leave the soil of the islamic republic of iran , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini told a news conference .
a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry told the dpa news agency on saturday that a german diplomat had left iran , but declined to say whether this was a tit-for-tat expulsion .
the hamburg-based weekly der spiegel reported last month that berlin had previously expelled an iranian diplomat in july after he allegedly sought to purchase equipment for his country 's controversial nuclear program .
the man , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reportedly in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria in an apparent attempt to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment the german foreign ministry declined to comment at the time .
western nations have been pushing for iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could potentially lead to the production of atomic weapons and their placement in the hands of fundamentalists .
tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
vital interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel sees iran as a challenge for germany 's foreign policy in a recent article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , german chancellor merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community .
she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous .
" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lsb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rsb- against israel also speaks volumes , " merkel wrote in the article published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .
28 .
reformists hope to mend ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes meanwhile , iran 's reformist politicians pledged on saturday to put an end to the ongoing crisis in relations with the west if they win the upcoming parliamentary elections .
" following our internationally acknowledged legitimate right to pursue peaceful nuclear technology should go parallel with an active diplomacy , " said habibullah bitaraf , one of the candidates of the reformist opposition coalition .
" if our diplomacy was right , then we would not have the current tensions with the west and the -lrb- un -rrb- sanctions , " he told a tehran press conference .
the reformist parties in iran have often criticized president mahmoud ahmadinejad economic and other policies , as well as his fiery , anti-western rhetoric , which has brought the country on the verge of international isolation .
registration for parliamentary elections state television said prospective candidates started registering to stand in the election for the 290-seat parliament throughout the islamic republic .
hopefuls have until next friday to fill out a four-page application on an interior ministry web site before going to the governor 's office to complete the process , iranian media reported .
all candidates , however , have to be approved by the hardline unelected guardians council , which has the right to disqualify any candidate it deems to be insufficiently qualified .

at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .

but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "
she reportedly turned down a hollywood studio contract after being told she would have to change her name and say she was austrian , not german .
nude scene provoked scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef continued to act and sing until shortly before her death in europe , knef was more of a household name , appearing in more than 50 films .
she became a star for her role as a former concentration camp inmate who returns home in wolfgang staudte 's 1946 production " murderers are among us . "
but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .
knef died in berlin in 2002 , aged 76 .
makatsch to star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say heike makatsch bears a resemblance to knef in the film about her life , she will be played by german actress heike makatsch , who was recently awarded a german film prize for her lead role performance in another biographical picture about margarete steiff , the wheelchair-bound founder of a famous german teddy bear manufacturing company .
knef 's third and final husband , paul von scheel , said he 's happy with the decision to cast makatsch as his glamorous wife .
" she is a tremendously talented , multi-faceted actress who will also be singing in the film , " he said .

5 , for tougher action against juvenile offenders and steps to make it easier to deport foreign criminals from the country . the call was contained in a resolution adopted at a meeting of the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as a debate raged on youth crime ahead of elections in two federal states later this month . the cdu wants the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences to be increased from 10 to 15 years and a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes . foreigners given a sentence of one year or more would be liable to deportation under the proposals , which also seek the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education . boot camps as a deterrent previously , merkel said she was in favor of boot camps and courts handing brief custodial sentences designed to act as a deterrent to juveniles given probation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to be tough on crime merkel 's remarks , released in advance of publication by the sunday edition of bild am sonntag , followed a much publicized attack by two immigrant youths that put a munich pensioner in hospital .
" i believe that a brief spell in custody and boot camps are a meaningful addition to our criminal justice system , " merkel said .
" they can help young people change their way of thinking at an earlier stage so that they do not end up in prison . "
under german law , courts can place young offenders in special detention centers for up to four weeks followed by probation .
in practice , however , such custodial sentences are rare and the youths are able to walk free on probation only .
" a short custodial sentence in addition to probation is better than allowing a person to lapse into becoming a repeat offender and enduring long years in prison , " merkel said .
hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras recorded the attack on a 76-year-old man in munich after the attack in munich , juvenile delinquency has shot to the top of the german political agenda , with some of merkel 's fellow christian democrats calling for a sharp clampdown .
earlier in the week , merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the government was considering if crime laws had to be toughened .
but he said the issues also included improving education and the integration of minorities .
munich police are holding a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national on attempted-murder charges for kicking and punching a retired school principal , 76 , who had asked them to obey a ban on smoking in an underground station on dec .
20 .
opposing voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boot camps , like this one in the us , may become more visible in germany a perception of widespread violence by youths , many of them born in germany but descended from " guest workers " - migrants who settled in germany in the 1960s - has triggered the debate about ethnic crime .
the most prominent voice was raised by roland koch , the state premier of hesse and member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ahead of the state elections on jan .
27 .
koch said last week there were " too many criminal foreigners " in germany and this week unveiled a six-point plan calling for a crackdown on delinquents , including more detention instead of fines .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , accused koch of playing the race card in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders .
but the chancellor defended koch , saying youth crime was a justified election issue because 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people under 21 , almost half of whom have immigrant backgrounds . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her career - which saw her try her hand at acting , singing and writing - spanned decades and continents , and encompassed both success and scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knef did n't make it big in hollywood but the film , which will begin shooting in germany in the spring of this year and which is entitled simply " the knef , " is to focus exclusively on the years between 1947 and 1953 , when knef left the chaos of postwar berlin on a disappointing quest for stardom in hollywood .
at a time when germans were not particularly welcome in the united states , knef pursued her film breakthrough in vain , never achieving the level of fame attained by fellow german star marlene dietrich , to whom knef is often compared .
instead , she became one of hundreds of young women chasing movie roles in hollywood , eventually landing a supporting role in " the snows of kilimanjaro , " an adaptation of the ernest hemingway story that starred gregory peck and ava gardner .
knef was more successful on broadway , where she landed the role of ninotchka in the cole porter musical " silk stockings . "

but it was her role as a prostitute in the 1951 willi forst movie " the sinner " that threw the actress headlong into controversy when her brief nude scene enraged the catholic church and sparked one of the biggest scandals in german filmmaking history .
knef launched her singing career in the 1960s , selling out concerts in austria , switzerland and germany .
her autobiography , published in 1970 , was a bestseller , and she also enjoyed moderate success with a second book documenting her battle with breast cancer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2008 midfielders ruled in first half of bundesliga season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is still flying high after swapping bremen green for munich red this time round , dw-world.de has opted for a 3-5-2 formation in choosing our top 11 .
that reflects the fact that the bundesliga is packed with midfielder talent .
but the strikers are n't bad either . strikers most german fans may have liked bayern 's miroslav klose better when he was plying his trade for over-achievers bremen .
but he remains the league 's premier striker -lrb- nine goals -rrb- and a team-oriented player -lrb- six assists -rrb- .
and with this summer 's european championship fast approaching , expect the german international to continuing using league matches to test his range .
bochum 's stanislav sestak faced a difficult task this season - replacing last year 's leading goal scorer theofanis gekas .
and with eight goals and seven assists , he 's passed that test with flying colors .
the slovakian has had few problems adjusting to the bundesliga and is a main reason bochum are spending the winter outside the relegation zone .
honorable mention : luca toni -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , marko pantelic -lrb- hertha berlin -rrb- midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego is the league 's most valuable player many bundesliga sides seem to believe that games are won and lost in midfield , and heading the pack is bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego .
with nine goals and seven assists , he 's the league 's most potent offensive threat .
but what was even more impressive was how he led the team through a potentially disastrous rash of early injuries to a spot atop the table , tied on points with bayern .
rafael van der vaart made negative headlines this summer with an attempt to force a transfer from hamburg .
but since he 's backed off his demands for a move , he 's led his side back into the top three , scoring nine goals in the process .
the only problem for hamburg is that there are now even more , bigger foreign clubs coveting the dutchman 's services .
with four goals and three assists , bayern 's franck ribery has n't posted quite the numbers as his opposite numbers in bremen and hamburg .
but the statistics in this case are deceptive since the role of this one-man highlight reel has been to break down defenses and leave his teammates to do the mopping up .
and that 's been crucial as the rest of bayern 's midfield has disappointed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery -lrb- r . -rrb- has been the sole source of esprit in bayern 's midfield newly promoted karlsruhe are sitting pretty in sixth place this winter , and that 's due in large measure to tamas hajnal .
the hungarian international has scored five goals and set up teammates with six assists while holding together a squad that has given much bigger opponents fits this season .
now many of those opponents are lining up the steal this expert poacher away from karlsruhe next season .
with all this midfield firepower , we should n't neglect the important job of protecting the backline while moving the ball up-field .
and leverkusen 's simon rolfes fits the bill to a tee .
the german soccer magazine kicker rates him as the league 's most effective player , and he 's featured in all but three minutes of his side 's bundesliga matches .
he 's also been excellent in the uefa cup , notching up one goal and four assists in the tournament .
honorable mention : david jarolim -lrb- hamburg -rrb- , sergei barbarez -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , daniel jensen -lrb- bremen -rrb- defense bayern have far and away the stingiest defense of the league , having only conceded eight goals in 17 games .
and the anchor of their back-line has been oft-ignored martin demichelis .
expected to be a substitute , the argentine has established himself in munich 's starting 11 and has only picked up two yellow cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers know there 's no messing with schalke 's bordon schalke have had an up-and-down year , but their solid work at the back has put them - albeit just barely - in the top five .
marcelo bordon has set the bone-crunching tone .
he was also instrumental in getting the royal blues into the knock-out stage of the champions league for the first time in club history .
with 13 goals conceded , hamburg have the league 's second best defense .
and joris mathijsen has been part of that bulwark for every single minute of his club 's campaigns in both the bundesliga and the uefa cup .
the dutchman 's consistency has been crucial in preserving a number of narrow hamburg wins .
honorable mention : per mertesacker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mario eggimann -lrb- karlsruhe -rrb- , andreas wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler is making his case for inclusion in germany 's euro 2008 squad twenty-year-old rené adler of leverkusen has leapfrogged a host of young colleagues and older veterans to become tops in a league known for quality between the posts .
adler has let in only 16 goals this season , and few , if any , have been his fault .
he 's also a master of the long ball , the first element in leverkusen 's fast-break attack .
honorable mention : markus miller -lrb- karlsruhe -rrb- , frank rost -lrb- hamburg -rrb- . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de world class stars aiding bundesliga 's rehabilitation when bayern munich bought some of the world 's most wanted players , it looked like game over .
but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars .

that reflects the fact that the bundesliga is packed with midfielder talent .
but the strikers are n't bad either . strikers most german fans may have liked bayern 's miroslav klose better when he was plying his trade for over-achievers bremen .
but he remains the league 's premier striker -lrb- nine goals -rrb- and a team-oriented player -lrb- six assists -rrb- .
and with this summer 's european championship fast approaching , expect the german international to continuing using league matches to test his range .
bochum 's stanislav sestak faced a difficult task this season - replacing last year 's leading goal scorer theofanis gekas .

timewatch : viking voyage sat 5 jan 2008 1955gmt , bbc two watch video at bbc history i was on board a replica viking longship , the world 's largest and most authentic , which was attempting to sail from denmark to dublin .
the aim of the voyage was to test the ship and gain an insight into how the vikings would have fared when making the same journey .
one of the first lessons was just how dependent we were on the weather .
with two days of strong winds in the right direction , we had managed to sail over 250 miles -lrb- 400km -rrb- in one stretch .
but once we reached norway , the situation changed .
for 10 days we were stuck on land with the wind blowing in the wrong direction or not at all .
a viking ship is very poor at tacking -lrb- sailing into the wind by zigzagging -rrb- .
using the oars is possible for short distances but getting all the way to scotland would take hundreds of hours of continuous rowing .
so the only option was to wait for the wind to change .
at first it was a welcome relief after 48 hours in an open boat in the rain .
but boredom soon turned out to be the biggest hazard .
see the viking warship in detail faced with the same adverse winds , the vikings would have faced an additional problem and i wonder if this could be at least part of the explanation for the viking reputation for rape and pillage . "
it was the most unusual and the wettest journey of my life " nathan williams they would soon have exhausted their own food supplies and so , naturally , they would turn to the local population to supply them - whether the local population wanted to or not .
their voyages would also have been far more hazardous without the benefit of modern weather forecasts .
when we did eventually set out into the north sea , we were warned of a gale and reluctantly accepted a tow rather than face winds that would at best have blown us back to port .
wind and waves in fact the greatest test the viking ship faced came towards the end of the voyage when too much wind , rather than too little , was the problem .
the wind had appeared to be moderate as the viking ship set off from scotland heading for the isle of man .
but as we reached open sea , the waves started to get larger and the wind rapidly increased .
soon there were waves coming over the side of the ship and we were all ordered into our survival suits .
we knew the situation was serious when we were suddenly ordered to take down the sail and bring the ship to a halt .
the stability of the viking longship depends on the flow of water over the hull .
and the rudder is only effective when moving forward .
without control the ship was turning more side on to the waves and so more waves were crashing over the side .
the noise from the wind and waves made communication very difficult and no one seemed to know why the sail was being taken down .
eventually i found the captain who was busy organising repairs .
the strap holding the rudder in place had snapped .
until they could repair the rudder , the ship was helpless .
meanwhile the life rafts were being prepared and it felt to me like there was a real chance the ship might not survive .
survive it did , however , and with a new rudder strap in place , we were able to sail once more and make it safely to the isle of man .
viking design the ship was made as far as possible using the original viking construction methods but clearly something had gone wrong .
" we have this weak point - the rudder - but everything else seems to work very well , " said carsten hvid , the skipper .
" i think it has something to do with the materials we 're using for the rope and the leather strap .
we have to find a new way to make these things . "
the ship builders have until this summer to work out a better way of attaching the rudder .
in july , the ship will set off from dublin on the return journey to denmark .
this time they will travel via the south coast of england and may even visit london , taking a week long detour to travel up the thames .
" just imagine the ship going through tower bridge - that would be a wonderful image , " dreams carsten .
he feels he now has a much better understanding of the characteristics of the ship .
" we 've learned how to handle the ship in different conditions , " carsten says .
" the ship is so narrow and so long you have to sail it in its own way compared to other ships .
" for instance , in hard weather we have to reef down earlier than we 're used to , because of the very long keel . "
there is still a huge amount of data to sift through generated during the voyage .
but already they have discovered that the longship is slower than expected .
overall though , carsten is very impressed with how the ship performed and is confident it will make it back to denmark safely .
" basically it works ! " he says .

with two days of strong winds in the right direction , we had managed to sail over 250 miles -lrb- 400km -rrb- in one stretch .
but once we reached norway , the situation changed .
for 10 days we were stuck on land with the wind blowing in the wrong direction or not at all .
a viking ship is very poor at tacking -lrb- sailing into the wind by zigzagging -rrb- .
follow the viking ship 's route enlarge image using the oars is possible for short distances but getting all the way to scotland would take hundreds of hours of continuous rowing .
so the only option was to wait for the wind to change .
at first it was a welcome relief after 48 hours in an open boat in the rain .
but boredom soon turned out to be the biggest hazard .
see the viking warship in detail faced with the same adverse winds , the vikings would have faced an additional problem and i wonder if this could be at least part of the explanation for the viking reputation for rape and pillage .
it was the most unusual and the wettest journey of my life nathan williams they would soon have exhausted their own food supplies and so , naturally , they would turn to the local population to supply them - whether the local population wanted to or not .
their voyages would also have been far more hazardous without the benefit of modern weather forecasts .
when we did eventually set out into the north sea , we were warned of a gale and reluctantly accepted a tow rather than face winds that would at best have blown us back to port .
wind and waves in fact the greatest test the viking ship faced came towards the end of the voyage when too much wind , rather than too little , was the problem .
the wind had appeared to be moderate as the viking ship set off from scotland heading for the isle of man .
but as we reached open sea , the waves started to get larger and the wind rapidly increased .
soon there were waves coming over the side of the ship and we were all ordered into our survival suits .
wind and waves provided a severe test of viking ship design we knew the situation was serious when we were suddenly ordered to take down the sail and bring the ship to a halt .
the stability of the viking longship depends on the flow of water over the hull .
and the rudder is only effective when moving forward .
without control the ship was turning more side on to the waves and so more waves were crashing over the side .
the noise from the wind and waves made communication very difficult and no one seemed to know why the sail was being taken down .
eventually i found the captain who was busy organising repairs .
the strap holding the rudder in place had snapped .
until they could repair the rudder , the ship was helpless .
meanwhile the life rafts were being prepared and it felt to me like there was a real chance the ship might not survive .
survive it did , however , and with a new rudder strap in place , we were able to sail once more and make it safely to the isle of man .
viking design the ship was made as far as possible using the original viking construction methods but clearly something had gone wrong .
carsten will sail the viking ship again in summer 2008 " we have this weak point - the rudder - but everything else seems to work very well , " said carsten hvid , the skipper .
" i think it has something to do with the materials we 're using for the rope and the leather strap .
we have to find a new way to make these things . "
the ship builders have until this summer to work out a better way of attaching the rudder .
in july , the ship will set off from dublin on the return journey to denmark .
this time they will travel via the south coast of england and may even visit london , taking a week long detour to travel up the thames .
" just imagine the ship going through tower bridge - that would be a wonderful image , " dreams carsten .
he feels he now has a much better understanding of the characteristics of the ship .
" we 've learned how to handle the ship in different conditions , " carsten says .
" the ship is so narrow and so long you have to sail it in its own way compared to other ships .
" for instance , in hard weather we have to reef down earlier than we 're used to , because of the very long keel . "
there is still a huge amount of data to sift through generated during the voyage .
but already they have discovered that the longship is slower than expected .
overall though , carsten is very impressed with how the ship performed and is confident it will make it back to denmark safely .
" basically it works ! " he says .

but as we reached open sea , the waves started to get larger and the wind rapidly increased .
soon there were waves coming over the side of the ship and we were all ordered into our survival suits .
wind and waves provided a severe test of viking ship design we knew the situation was serious when we were suddenly ordered to take down the sail and bring the ship to a halt .
the stability of the viking longship depends on the flow of water over the hull .
and the rudder is only effective when moving forward .
without control the ship was turning more side on to the waves and so more waves were crashing over the side .
the noise from the wind and waves made communication very difficult and no one seemed to know why the sail was being taken down .
eventually i found the captain who was busy organising repairs .
the strap holding the rudder in place had snapped .
until they could repair the rudder , the ship was helpless .
meanwhile the life rafts were being prepared and it felt to me like there was a real chance the ship might not survive .
survive it did , however , and with a new rudder strap in place , we were able to sail once more and make it safely to the isle of man .
viking design the ship was made as far as possible using the original viking construction methods but clearly something had gone wrong .
carsten will sail the viking ship again in summer 2008 " we have this weak point - the rudder - but everything else seems to work very well , " said carsten hvid , the skipper .
" i think it has something to do with the materials we 're using for the rope and the leather strap .
we have to find a new way to make these things . "
the ship builders have until this summer to work out a better way of attaching the rudder .
in july , the ship will set off from dublin on the return journey to denmark .
this time they will travel via the south coast of england and may even visit london , taking a week long detour to travel up the thames .
" just imagine the ship going through tower bridge - that would be a wonderful image , " dreams carsten .
he feels he now has a much better understanding of the characteristics of the ship .
" we 've learned how to handle the ship in different conditions , " carsten says .
" the ship is so narrow and so long you have to sail it in its own way compared to other ships .
" for instance , in hard weather we have to reef down earlier than we 're used to , because of the very long keel . "
there is still a huge amount of data to sift through generated during the voyage .
but already they have discovered that the longship is slower than expected .
overall though , carsten is very impressed with how the ship performed and is confident it will make it back to denmark safely .
" basically it works ! " he says .
timewatch : viking voyage is on bbc two on saturday 5 january at 1955gmt .
the sea stallion from glendalough 1 .
the crew of 65 men and women sleep on the open deck , as the vikings did , and take turn keeping watch 2 .
satellite navigation equipment makes sure the ship stays on course .
vikings had to rely on the position of the sun and stars , the colour and movement of the sea and wind direction 3 .
oak planks were cut radially for maximum strength , overlapped and nailed together .
axes and other tools used to make the planks were replicas of those used by the vikings 4 .
the sail , mast , rigging and rudder on the original were missing so these have been copied from other finds 5 .
shields , vital in battle , were tied over the oarports when the ship was in port sources : viking ship museum , denmark ; national maritime museum , uk .

after natasha collins ' death in london , her partner mark speight was arrested on suspicion of murder and supplying cocaine , which he vehemently denied .
he would never have " harmed tash " , mr speight 's mother jacqueline said .
a mix-up with drugs prescribed for a medical condition may have led to the 31-year-old 's death , she added .
talking to reporters outside her home in wolverhampton , mrs speight said the couple had been together " for quite a while " .
" as far as i know , everything was ok between them , " she said . "
there is no way on earth that mark would do anything to harm tash " mark speight 's mother jacqueline asked for her reaction to the tragedy , she replied : " i 'm in absolute shock .
i was only with them at christmas .
they both seemed fine and very happy . "
she added : " there is no way on earth that mark would do anything to harm tash . "
car accident mr speight is known as one of the faces of bbc children 's tv , particularly the smart programme , which he has presented since 1995 .
he had worked with ms collins , who was also a model , on children 's series see it saw it .
mark speight has also appeared on cbeebies ' smarteenies she was planning to set up her own production company with compensation she received after a car accident seven years ago .
on friday a statement was issued on behalf of ms collins ' mother , whose first name was not given .
" we are all absolutely distraught over the death of natasha , " it read .
" she was our loving , caring daughter who was always full of life .
" this is a very emotional time for us as a family .
we ask simply to be allowed to grieve . "
a spokeswoman for mr speight said the presenter had found ms collins ' body in the bathroom of their home in st john 's wood " and immediately called an ambulance and the police " .
" mark was the only other person present in the flat and has therefore been questioned by police as a matter of course .
" he is assisting police with their enquiries and had nothing to do with natasha 's death , " she said , before adding : " mark is absolutely distraught . "
a spokesman for the metropolitan police said a suspected drug overdose was one line of inquiry which was being considered .
further details of the circumstances leading up to ms collins ' death are unlikely to emerge before a post-mortem is conducted , and this is expected to be on monday .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- q & a : junior doctor job controversy home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health medical notes science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : saturday , 5 january 2008 , 11:27 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : junior doctor job controversy many junior doctors are unhappy reforms of the process for selecting junior doctors for specialist training posts have been dogged by controversy .
now , the doctors have been warned that competition for jobs this year will be tougher than ever .
how has doctors ' training been changed ?
training was revamped in 2005 , with the aim of speeding up progress so juniors could reach consultant level in an average of 11 years , rather than the current 14 .
it meant doctors who had been through their initial stage of training under both the old and the new systems were all competing for a limited number of specialist training posts .
this is the point at which a doctor would select to focus on an area of expertise , such as cancer medicine or paediatrics .
as a result , the number of training posts available was hugely outnumbered by the number of doctors applying for them .
the exact figures were disputed , but it was estimated that more than 30,000 doctors were applying for around 20,000 posts in 2007 .
how did the system work ?
it operated through a website run by the medical training and application service -lrb- mtas -rrb- .
however , last year the website crashed under the pressure of large numbers of junior doctors trying to apply online simultaneously , and the application period had to be extended .
not only could the system not cope with demand , doctors argued that it was badly organised and failed to draw out applicants ' relevant expertise .
there was evidence that able doctors had not been offered any interviews .
it was also claimed that non-medically qualified staff were involved in the recruitment process , while consultants had insufficient time to shortlist applicants fairly .
it also emerged that the mtas system had been the subject of two security breaches , with experts unable to rule out the possibility of criminal behaviour .
what happened ?
amid threats from consultants to boycott the process and to refuse to appoint any doctors to specialist posts , the government ordered a review .
following that review , every applicant for postgraduate medical training was guaranteed at least one interview for their first preference post .
it was agreed mtas would not be used for subsequent recruitment rounds in 2007 .
instead , applications were cv-based and managed by medical deaneries at local level .
mtas was ditched by ministers for the year , with the then health secretary patricia hewitt saying the system would have only a monitoring role after the first round of recruitment .
what did the doctors do ?
a campaign group called remedy uk launched a legal challenge seeking to get the first round of recruitment scrapped .
it argued that the system was a completely inappropriate way of assessing doctors , and effectively unlawful .
it said that posts allocated via mtas should be made temporary , so that they could be re-assessed under a cv-based system in 2008 .
however that was not supported by the british medical association , which argued forcing people to re-apply for jobs through yet another new and untested system would be unfair .
bma chairman james johnson was forced to resign over the issue , amid accusations that he had failed to reflect the anger among the profession .
remedy uk lost its battle in the high court , although the judge said medics were justified to feel angry .
what is the situation this year ?
the process has been changed .
applications will be handled by local medical deaneries , and without a limit on the number of applications a doctor can make .
recruitment body nhs employers said there may be an average of three applicants per post .
there will be around 9,000 places on speciality training programmes in england , attracting as many as 23,000 applications - a situation expected to be reflected across the uk .
it is expected that half the applications may come from doctors who qualified outside the eu .
the government tried to give uk medical graduates priority , but that was overturned after a legal challenge .
ministers will appeal but that will not be in time to affect the situation for 2008 .
nhs employers said competition means patients will get the best doctors , but remedy uk insisted the system was still unfair .

now , the doctors have been warned that competition for jobs this year will be tougher than ever .
how has doctors ' training been changed ?
training was revamped in 2005 , with the aim of speeding up progress so juniors could reach consultant level in an average of 11 years , rather than the current 14 .
it meant doctors who had been through their initial stage of training under both the old and the new systems were all competing for a limited number of specialist training posts .
this is the point at which a doctor would select to focus on an area of expertise , such as cancer medicine or paediatrics .
as a result , the number of training posts available was hugely outnumbered by the number of doctors applying for them .
the exact figures were disputed , but it was estimated that more than 30,000 doctors were applying for around 20,000 posts in 2007 .
how did the system work ?
it operated through a website run by the medical training and application service -lrb- mtas -rrb- .
however , last year the website crashed under the pressure of large numbers of junior doctors trying to apply online simultaneously , and the application period had to be extended .
not only could the system not cope with demand , doctors argued that it was badly organised and failed to draw out applicants ' relevant expertise .
there was evidence that able doctors had not been offered any interviews .
it was also claimed that non-medically qualified staff were involved in the recruitment process , while consultants had insufficient time to shortlist applicants fairly .
it also emerged that the mtas system had been the subject of two security breaches , with experts unable to rule out the possibility of criminal behaviour .
what happened ?
amid threats from consultants to boycott the process and to refuse to appoint any doctors to specialist posts , the government ordered a review .
following that review , every applicant for postgraduate medical training was guaranteed at least one interview for their first preference post .
it was agreed mtas would not be used for subsequent recruitment rounds in 2007 .
instead , applications were cv-based and managed by medical deaneries at local level .
mtas was ditched by ministers for the year , with the then health secretary patricia hewitt saying the system would have only a monitoring role after the first round of recruitment .
what did the doctors do ?
a campaign group called remedy uk launched a legal challenge seeking to get the first round of recruitment scrapped .
it argued that the system was a completely inappropriate way of assessing doctors , and effectively unlawful .
it said that posts allocated via mtas should be made temporary , so that they could be re-assessed under a cv-based system in 2008 .
however that was not supported by the british medical association , which argued forcing people to re-apply for jobs through yet another new and untested system would be unfair .
bma chairman james johnson was forced to resign over the issue , amid accusations that he had failed to reflect the anger among the profession .
remedy uk lost its battle in the high court , although the judge said medics were justified to feel angry .
what is the situation this year ?
the process has been changed .
applications will be handled by local medical deaneries , and without a limit on the number of applications a doctor can make .
recruitment body nhs employers said there may be an average of three applicants per post .
there will be around 9,000 places on speciality training programmes in england , attracting as many as 23,000 applications - a situation expected to be reflected across the uk .
it is expected that half the applications may come from doctors who qualified outside the eu .
the government tried to give uk medical graduates priority , but that was overturned after a legal challenge .
ministers will appeal but that will not be in time to affect the situation for 2008 .
nhs employers said competition means patients will get the best doctors , but remedy uk insisted the system was still unfair .
