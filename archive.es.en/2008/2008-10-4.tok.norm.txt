3 .
" after this transaction , fortis group entails fortis insurance belgium , fortis insurance international and the banking activities excluding fortis bank nederland -lrb- holding -rrb- , " the statement said .
divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all new applicants for handgun licenses will now have to show they 've been active members of a gun club for one year .
they will also be required to provide a note from a doctor about their mental health , and sit an interview with at least two police officers .
the rules cover permits for pistols and revolvers of all sizes , and permits will have time limits .
finnish interior minister anne holmlund has set up a panel to look at the country 's gun laws .
school rampage raised concerns last month 's school shooting in the western town of kauhajoki has led to calls for a tightening of gun laws in finland .
holmlund wants police to have more access to the health data of gun owners , and has even floated the idea of banning certain types of weapons altogether .
the government has acted quickly to change the restrictions on gun permits , but a complete overhaul of finland 's gun laws is expected to take more than two years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 04.10.2008 benelux governments break up fortis group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics said the deal was agreed too quickly and secretively the dutch , belgian and luxembourg governments have agreed to break up fortis , nearly a week after 49 percent of the fallen banking giant was nationalized . the dutch government has acquired the bank 's financial and insurance operations in the netherlands for 16.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- , the bank confirmed in a statement friday evening , oct .
3 .
" after this transaction , fortis group entails fortis insurance belgium , fortis insurance international and the banking activities excluding fortis bank nederland -lrb- holding -rrb- , " the statement said .
divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "
however , the idea was quickly rejected by berlin , with a spokesman for merkel saying , " i do n't know anyone at the moment who is seriously proposing such a european model . "

the british prime minister 's spokesman said that while the financial crisis had a " european dimension , " individual countries wanted to come up with their own solution because it is their taxpayers ' money that is at risk .
but the danger of a nationalistic approach to the crisis was made clear earlier in the week , when the irish government decided unilaterally to guarantee all deposits in irish-owned banks for the next two years .

meanwhile european governing body uefa has warned that poland could lose the right to co-host euro 2012 with ukraine if the matter is not resolved to its satisfaction by monday , pap reported .
fifa on wednesday gave poland until midday on monday to reinstate pzpn officials ousted by an polish olympic committee arbitration court .

tusk asked journalists in warsaw what values there were in football , where " one thief after another appears , " before stating that it was better to reach tough decisions in order to clean up the sport .
fighting corruption in soccer on monday , the pzpn was suspended by an arbitration court of the nation 's olympic committee , which appointed robert zawlocki temporary head of the organization .
it followed a motion from the sports ministry which has long been dissatisfied with pzpn 's handling of corruption in polish football .
zawlocki later suspended pzpn boss michel listkiewicz and the rest of the board .
polish football has been plagued by corruption in recent years , with more than 20 clubs , referees , federations , club officials and players allegedly involved in match fixing .
fifa and uefa said they would continue to recognize the current leadership chaired by listkiewicz as the " only legitimate authority , " and would " ignore " any communication from zawlocki 's group . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 against czech republic and oct .
15 against slovakia if it were in breach of statutes after the deadline .
their opponents could then be awarded a 3-0 win .
on friday , polish prime minister donald tusk lent his support to his sports minister , miroslaw drzewiecki , in the battle with the pzpn .
tusk asked journalists in warsaw what values there were in football , where " one thief after another appears , " before stating that it was better to reach tough decisions in order to clean up the sport .
fighting corruption in soccer on monday , the pzpn was suspended by an arbitration court of the nation 's olympic committee , which appointed robert zawlocki temporary head of the organization .
it followed a motion from the sports ministry which has long been dissatisfied with pzpn 's handling of corruption in polish football .
zawlocki later suspended pzpn boss michel listkiewicz and the rest of the board .
polish football has been plagued by corruption in recent years , with more than 20 clubs , referees , federations , club officials and players allegedly involved in match fixing .
fifa and uefa said they would continue to recognize the current leadership chaired by listkiewicz as the " only legitimate authority , " and would " ignore " any communication from zawlocki 's group . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
" after this transaction , fortis group entails fortis insurance belgium , fortis insurance international and the banking activities excluding fortis bank nederland -lrb- holding -rrb- , " the statement said .
divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 04.10.2008 benelux governments break up fortis group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics said the deal was agreed too quickly and secretively the dutch , belgian and luxembourg governments have agreed to break up fortis , nearly a week after 49 percent of the fallen banking giant was nationalized . the dutch government has acquired the bank 's financial and insurance operations in the netherlands for 16.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- , the bank confirmed in a statement friday evening , oct .
3 .
" after this transaction , fortis group entails fortis insurance belgium , fortis insurance international and the banking activities excluding fortis bank nederland -lrb- holding -rrb- , " the statement said .
divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "

this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved .

tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "

washington has approved its historic $ 700-billion bailout package , but eu leaders are divided over what action to take . disagreements , however , center around a plan , reportedly favored by france , to set up a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 415 billion -rrb- fund to help troubled european financial institutions .
in particular , this has provoked tensions between france and germany , who have diverging views of how the european union should function .
berlin is traditionally more opposed to a centralized approach , especially in monetary affairs .
britain , along with germany , has been reluctant to commit taxpayers ' money to a europe-managed fund and advocates a case-by-case approach to rescuing financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't quite as cozy between germany and france at the moment saturday 's mini-summit was called by sarkozy , who wants to arrive at a common position on the finance crisis ahead of the oct .
15 eu summit and a g8 meeting to be held in november in the united states .
leaders of the four eu members of the g8 group of leading industrial nations will be present .

3 .
the polish pap news agency quoted senior polish sports ministry official adam giersz as saying talks would not be resumed " until fifa retracts its ultimatum . "
meanwhile european governing body uefa has warned that poland could lose the right to co-host euro 2012 with ukraine if the matter is not resolved to its satisfaction by monday , pap reported .
fifa on wednesday gave poland until midday on monday to reinstate pzpn officials ousted by an polish olympic committee arbitration court .
possble ban from world cup qualifiers it said poland could be barred from 2010 world cup qualifiers scheduled for oct .
11 against czech republic and oct .
15 against slovakia if it were in breach of statutes after the deadline .
their opponents could then be awarded a 3-0 win .
on friday , polish prime minister donald tusk lent his support to his sports minister , miroslaw drzewiecki , in the battle with the pzpn .
tusk asked journalists in warsaw what values there were in football , where " one thief after another appears , " before stating that it was better to reach tough decisions in order to clean up the sport .
fighting corruption in soccer on monday , the pzpn was suspended by an arbitration court of the nation 's olympic committee , which appointed robert zawlocki temporary head of the organization .
it followed a motion from the sports ministry which has long been dissatisfied with pzpn 's handling of corruption in polish football .
zawlocki later suspended pzpn boss michel listkiewicz and the rest of the board .
polish football has been plagued by corruption in recent years , with more than 20 clubs , referees , federations , club officials and players allegedly involved in match fixing .

washington has approved its historic $ 700-billion bailout package , but eu leaders are divided over what action to take . disagreements , however , center around a plan , reportedly favored by france , to set up a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 415 billion -rrb- fund to help troubled european financial institutions .
in particular , this has provoked tensions between france and germany , who have diverging views of how the european union should function .
berlin is traditionally more opposed to a centralized approach , especially in monetary affairs .
britain , along with germany , has been reluctant to commit taxpayers ' money to a europe-managed fund and advocates a case-by-case approach to rescuing financial institutions .

leaders of the four eu members of the g8 group of leading industrial nations will be present .

the french president will host talks with international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn on saturday ahead of the mini-summit .
france sees the global financial upheavals sparked by the us banking crisis as an opportunity to push for more state regulation of the economy .
strauss-kahn , a former french finance minister , also argued last week that the imf needed to tighten up its control over financial markets in the wake of the crisis .

finance ministers from all member states are due to meet on monday in luxembourg .
supporters and detractors of the bailout fund according to various media reports , the idea of a bailout fund was first suggested to sarkozy by dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a recent meeting , and it was immediately seconded by oecd head angel gurria .
speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "
however , the idea was quickly rejected by berlin , with a spokesman for merkel saying , " i do n't know anyone at the moment who is seriously proposing such a european model . "

the british prime minister 's spokesman said that while the financial crisis had a " european dimension , " individual countries wanted to come up with their own solution because it is their taxpayers ' money that is at risk .

3 .
" after this transaction , fortis group entails fortis insurance belgium , fortis insurance international and the banking activities excluding fortis bank nederland -lrb- holding -rrb- , " the statement said .
divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .

fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .

while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "

tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "

instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ruled spain until his death in 1975 .
the dictatorship paid tribute to francoist victims of the war , while the republicans were forgotten .

divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .

fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "

by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved .

tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "

in addition , certain families which have not already received any economic damages under other laws can also seek a compensation of 135,000 euros -lrb- $ 185,000 -rrb- .
the other decrees passed friday , oct .
3 , provide for franco 's victims to retrieve personal documents from the civil war archives , and for foreigners who fought against franco in the civil war to get spanish nationality .
franco 's mutiny against the leftist republican government sparked the civil war , which franco won .
he ruled spain until his death in 1975 .
the dictatorship paid tribute to francoist victims of the war , while the republicans were forgotten .
measures to rehabilitate their memory are based on the 2007 law of historic memory , which the socialist government passed despite the disapproval of the conservative opposition . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington has approved its historic $ 700-billion bailout package , but eu leaders are divided over what action to take . disagreements , however , center around a plan , reportedly favored by france , to set up a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 415 billion -rrb- fund to help troubled european financial institutions .
in particular , this has provoked tensions between france and germany , who have diverging views of how the european union should function .
berlin is traditionally more opposed to a centralized approach , especially in monetary affairs .
britain , along with germany , has been reluctant to commit taxpayers ' money to a europe-managed fund and advocates a case-by-case approach to rescuing financial institutions .

the french president will host talks with international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn on saturday ahead of the mini-summit .
france sees the global financial upheavals sparked by the us banking crisis as an opportunity to push for more state regulation of the economy .

speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "

the british prime minister 's spokesman said that while the financial crisis had a " european dimension , " individual countries wanted to come up with their own solution because it is their taxpayers ' money that is at risk .

the polish pap news agency quoted senior polish sports ministry official adam giersz as saying talks would not be resumed " until fifa retracts its ultimatum . "
meanwhile european governing body uefa has warned that poland could lose the right to co-host euro 2012 with ukraine if the matter is not resolved to its satisfaction by monday , pap reported .
fifa on wednesday gave poland until midday on monday to reinstate pzpn officials ousted by an polish olympic committee arbitration court .

their opponents could then be awarded a 3-0 win .
on friday , polish prime minister donald tusk lent his support to his sports minister , miroslaw drzewiecki , in the battle with the pzpn .
tusk asked journalists in warsaw what values there were in football , where " one thief after another appears , " before stating that it was better to reach tough decisions in order to clean up the sport .
fighting corruption in soccer on monday , the pzpn was suspended by an arbitration court of the nation 's olympic committee , which appointed robert zawlocki temporary head of the organization .
it followed a motion from the sports ministry which has long been dissatisfied with pzpn 's handling of corruption in polish football .
zawlocki later suspended pzpn boss michel listkiewicz and the rest of the board .
polish football has been plagued by corruption in recent years , with more than 20 clubs , referees , federations , club officials and players allegedly involved in match fixing .
fifa and uefa said they would continue to recognize the current leadership chaired by listkiewicz as the " only legitimate authority , " and would " ignore " any communication from zawlocki 's group . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .

by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .

divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .

fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "

this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 04.10.2008 european leaders hold emergency finance summit in paris großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not at one over their response to global credit crunch french president nicolas sarkozy has called an emergency finance summit in paris saturday .
washington has approved its historic $ 700-billion bailout package , but eu leaders are divided over what action to take . disagreements , however , center around a plan , reportedly favored by france , to set up a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 415 billion -rrb- fund to help troubled european financial institutions .
in particular , this has provoked tensions between france and germany , who have diverging views of how the european union should function .
berlin is traditionally more opposed to a centralized approach , especially in monetary affairs .
britain , along with germany , has been reluctant to commit taxpayers ' money to a europe-managed fund and advocates a case-by-case approach to rescuing financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't quite as cozy between germany and france at the moment saturday 's mini-summit was called by sarkozy , who wants to arrive at a common position on the finance crisis ahead of the oct .
15 eu summit and a g8 meeting to be held in november in the united states .
leaders of the four eu members of the g8 group of leading industrial nations will be present .
joining sarkozy in paris will be german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , along with european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , jean-claude juncker .
the french president will host talks with international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn on saturday ahead of the mini-summit .
france sees the global financial upheavals sparked by the us banking crisis as an opportunity to push for more state regulation of the economy .
strauss-kahn , a former french finance minister , also argued last week that the imf needed to tighten up its control over financial markets in the wake of the crisis .
call for unity french prime minister francois fillon urged europe on friday , oct .
3 , to find a united response to the credit crunch ahead of saturday 's meeting .
" the world is on the edge of the abyss because of an irresponsible system , " fillon told members of france 's governing conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is said to be a brainchild of the dutch prime minister " nicolas sarkozy will reiterate that the only way out of this crisis will be a collective one .
he will propose that europe make its banking systems secure , unfreeze credit and coordinate its economic and monetary strategy , " he added .
but european parliament president hans-gert poettering of germany urged leaders to remember that the weekend mini-summit could only make proposals on how to deal with the global financial crisis . " i want to be clear : the meeting can only be for proposals .
they ca n't decide for the eu .
decisions have to be taken by all 27 -lrb- member -rrb- countries and by the european institutions , " he told an economic conference in madrid .
finance ministers from all member states are due to meet on monday in luxembourg .
supporters and detractors of the bailout fund according to various media reports , the idea of a bailout fund was first suggested to sarkozy by dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a recent meeting , and it was immediately seconded by oecd head angel gurria .
speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "
however , the idea was quickly rejected by berlin , with a spokesman for merkel saying , " i do n't know anyone at the moment who is seriously proposing such a european model . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck does n't want to let go of the purse strings and a spokesman for finance minister peter steinbrueck said , " the federal government does n't think such plans are good .
tailored solutions are the better way . "
the british prime minister 's spokesman said that while the financial crisis had a " european dimension , " individual countries wanted to come up with their own solution because it is their taxpayers ' money that is at risk .

washington has approved its historic $ 700-billion bailout package , but eu leaders are divided over what action to take . disagreements , however , center around a plan , reportedly favored by france , to set up a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 415 billion -rrb- fund to help troubled european financial institutions .
in particular , this has provoked tensions between france and germany , who have diverging views of how the european union should function .
berlin is traditionally more opposed to a centralized approach , especially in monetary affairs .
britain , along with germany , has been reluctant to commit taxpayers ' money to a europe-managed fund and advocates a case-by-case approach to rescuing financial institutions .

leaders of the four eu members of the g8 group of leading industrial nations will be present .
joining sarkozy in paris will be german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , along with european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , jean-claude juncker .
the french president will host talks with international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn on saturday ahead of the mini-summit .
france sees the global financial upheavals sparked by the us banking crisis as an opportunity to push for more state regulation of the economy .

he will propose that europe make its banking systems secure , unfreeze credit and coordinate its economic and monetary strategy , " he added .
but european parliament president hans-gert poettering of germany urged leaders to remember that the weekend mini-summit could only make proposals on how to deal with the global financial crisis . " i want to be clear : the meeting can only be for proposals .
they ca n't decide for the eu .
decisions have to be taken by all 27 -lrb- member -rrb- countries and by the european institutions , " he told an economic conference in madrid .
finance ministers from all member states are due to meet on monday in luxembourg .
supporters and detractors of the bailout fund according to various media reports , the idea of a bailout fund was first suggested to sarkozy by dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a recent meeting , and it was immediately seconded by oecd head angel gurria .
speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "
however , the idea was quickly rejected by berlin , with a spokesman for merkel saying , " i do n't know anyone at the moment who is seriously proposing such a european model . "

the british prime minister 's spokesman said that while the financial crisis had a " european dimension , " individual countries wanted to come up with their own solution because it is their taxpayers ' money that is at risk .

supporters and detractors of the bailout fund according to various media reports , the idea of a bailout fund was first suggested to sarkozy by dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a recent meeting , and it was immediately seconded by oecd head angel gurria .
speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "
however , the idea was quickly rejected by berlin , with a spokesman for merkel saying , " i do n't know anyone at the moment who is seriously proposing such a european model . "

3 .
" after this transaction , fortis group entails fortis insurance belgium , fortis insurance international and the banking activities excluding fortis bank nederland -lrb- holding -rrb- , " the statement said .
divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the polish pap news agency quoted senior polish sports ministry official adam giersz as saying talks would not be resumed " until fifa retracts its ultimatum . "
meanwhile european governing body uefa has warned that poland could lose the right to co-host euro 2012 with ukraine if the matter is not resolved to its satisfaction by monday , pap reported .
fifa on wednesday gave poland until midday on monday to reinstate pzpn officials ousted by an polish olympic committee arbitration court .

15 against slovakia if it were in breach of statutes after the deadline .
their opponents could then be awarded a 3-0 win .
on friday , polish prime minister donald tusk lent his support to his sports minister , miroslaw drzewiecki , in the battle with the pzpn .
tusk asked journalists in warsaw what values there were in football , where " one thief after another appears , " before stating that it was better to reach tough decisions in order to clean up the sport .
fighting corruption in soccer on monday , the pzpn was suspended by an arbitration court of the nation 's olympic committee , which appointed robert zawlocki temporary head of the organization .
it followed a motion from the sports ministry which has long been dissatisfied with pzpn 's handling of corruption in polish football .
zawlocki later suspended pzpn boss michel listkiewicz and the rest of the board .
polish football has been plagued by corruption in recent years , with more than 20 clubs , referees , federations , club officials and players allegedly involved in match fixing .
fifa and uefa said they would continue to recognize the current leadership chaired by listkiewicz as the " only legitimate authority , " and would " ignore " any communication from zawlocki 's group . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .

he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved .

the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bank information or credit card numbers were not accessed , said the bonn-based firm . there has reportedly been no indication that the data has been misused , though the telekom said " extreme criminal energy " was behind the theft . german newsmagazine spiegel reported on saturday , oct .
4 , that is had obtained access to the missing information via a third party .
the news apparently came as a surprise to deutsche telekom , where the case was considered closed . data case resurfaces " we had assumed that this data had been fully secured as part of an investigation by the district attorney , " philipp humm , director of deutsche telekom 's mobile phone division t-mobile , said in a statement .
data security measures had been fortified since 2006 , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another dark day for deutsche telekom according to media reports saturday , oct .

3 .
" after this transaction , fortis group entails fortis insurance belgium , fortis insurance international and the banking activities excluding fortis bank nederland -lrb- holding -rrb- , " the statement said .
divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .
enhancing liquidity " the integration will only be easier and more efficient now that the company has become less complicated , " wellink said , adding that the full integration would generate 1 billion euros per year - money that is badly needed to enhance the bank 's liquidity .
rather than abn amro merging into fortis , it is now expected that fortis will merge within abn amro , still the bigger of the two banks in the netherlands .
fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .
belgian arm suffering most dutch finance minister wouter bos said it was mostly the belgian part of fortis that was suffering from continued liquidity problems .
while stability returned to the stock market , several major business clients in belgium left the bank , bos said .
this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved . "
new deal , new questions in a response to the new deal , dutch legislator paul tang of the labour party said the " new agreement raises questions that need to be answered . "
tang , whose party is the second largest in the ruling coalition , also said it was " incredible the government did not mention negotiations about a new deal were going on in recent days . "
legislator kees vendrik of the green party , said it " did not generate a lot of confidence that the government finds it necessary to repair an agreement worth billions of euros within a week . "
fortis had been in dire need of extra funding due to its participation in the takeover of dutch abn amro bank in 2007 , for which it paid some 24 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

divided along national lines the move , agreed between the governments of the three countries , splits fortis ' former empire into separate dutch and luxembourg-belgian businesses .
on sunday , the governments of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands nationalized 49 percent of fortis .
the dutch government then took over 49 percent of all fortis activities in the netherlands , paying some 4 billion euros .
the new deal involves a takeover of all fortis activities in the netherlands .
also , sunday 's planned sale of dutch abn amro bank , taken over by fortis in 2007 but still operating autonomously within fortis nv until late 2009 , has now been cancelled .
instead , dutch central bank -lrb- dnb -rrb- president nout wellink said the integration of abn amro and fortis , as planned following the merger of the two in 2007 , would go through .

fortis and abn amro combined have some 45,000 employees , who , following the nationalization , have formally become civil servants of the dutch state .
speaking at a press conference on friday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the new deal was " necessary in order to create stability on the financial markets . "
balkenende said that fortis was still suffering from liquidity problems after the sunday 's partial nationalization of the bank by the benelux governments .

this meant the bank remained on the brink of collapse in recent days .
by taking out the dutch part of fortis , this division would remain safeguarded from further risks , bos said .
he added the deal also generated money , which could solve the liquidity problems of the belgium fortis division .
bos emphasized the full nationalization of all fortis activities in the netherlands was a " temporary " measure , and that fortis would return to private ownership once stability had returned to the markets .
belgian prime minister yves leterme said the new deal , negotiated between the dutch and the belgian governments thursday night , was made " in close cooperation with the watchdogs on the financial markets , and in particular taking into account the evolution of the liquidity in the bank systems of the countries involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 04.10.2008 european leaders hold emergency finance summit in paris großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not at one over their response to global credit crunch french president nicolas sarkozy has called an emergency finance summit in paris saturday .
washington has approved its historic $ 700-billion bailout package , but eu leaders are divided over what action to take . disagreements , however , center around a plan , reportedly favored by france , to set up a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 415 billion -rrb- fund to help troubled european financial institutions .
in particular , this has provoked tensions between france and germany , who have diverging views of how the european union should function .
berlin is traditionally more opposed to a centralized approach , especially in monetary affairs .
britain , along with germany , has been reluctant to commit taxpayers ' money to a europe-managed fund and advocates a case-by-case approach to rescuing financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't quite as cozy between germany and france at the moment saturday 's mini-summit was called by sarkozy , who wants to arrive at a common position on the finance crisis ahead of the oct .
15 eu summit and a g8 meeting to be held in november in the united states .
leaders of the four eu members of the g8 group of leading industrial nations will be present .
joining sarkozy in paris will be german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , along with european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , jean-claude juncker .
the french president will host talks with international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn on saturday ahead of the mini-summit .
france sees the global financial upheavals sparked by the us banking crisis as an opportunity to push for more state regulation of the economy .
strauss-kahn , a former french finance minister , also argued last week that the imf needed to tighten up its control over financial markets in the wake of the crisis .
call for unity french prime minister francois fillon urged europe on friday , oct .
3 , to find a united response to the credit crunch ahead of saturday 's meeting .
" the world is on the edge of the abyss because of an irresponsible system , " fillon told members of france 's governing conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is said to be a brainchild of the dutch prime minister " nicolas sarkozy will reiterate that the only way out of this crisis will be a collective one .
he will propose that europe make its banking systems secure , unfreeze credit and coordinate its economic and monetary strategy , " he added .
but european parliament president hans-gert poettering of germany urged leaders to remember that the weekend mini-summit could only make proposals on how to deal with the global financial crisis . " i want to be clear : the meeting can only be for proposals .
they ca n't decide for the eu .
decisions have to be taken by all 27 -lrb- member -rrb- countries and by the european institutions , " he told an economic conference in madrid .
finance ministers from all member states are due to meet on monday in luxembourg .
supporters and detractors of the bailout fund according to various media reports , the idea of a bailout fund was first suggested to sarkozy by dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a recent meeting , and it was immediately seconded by oecd head angel gurria .
speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "
however , the idea was quickly rejected by berlin , with a spokesman for merkel saying , " i do n't know anyone at the moment who is seriously proposing such a european model . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck does n't want to let go of the purse strings and a spokesman for finance minister peter steinbrueck said , " the federal government does n't think such plans are good .
tailored solutions are the better way . "
the british prime minister 's spokesman said that while the financial crisis had a " european dimension , " individual countries wanted to come up with their own solution because it is their taxpayers ' money that is at risk .
but the danger of a nationalistic approach to the crisis was made clear earlier in the week , when the irish government decided unilaterally to guarantee all deposits in irish-owned banks for the next two years .
london has been forced to respond after a flight of capital from british lenders to irish banks .
on friday , britain increased the compensation limit for banks savings to 50,000 pounds -lrb- 64,000 euros , $ 88,500 -rrb- in an effort to make its own banks more attractive . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington has approved its historic $ 700-billion bailout package , but eu leaders are divided over what action to take . disagreements , however , center around a plan , reportedly favored by france , to set up a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 415 billion -rrb- fund to help troubled european financial institutions .
in particular , this has provoked tensions between france and germany , who have diverging views of how the european union should function .
berlin is traditionally more opposed to a centralized approach , especially in monetary affairs .
britain , along with germany , has been reluctant to commit taxpayers ' money to a europe-managed fund and advocates a case-by-case approach to rescuing financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't quite as cozy between germany and france at the moment saturday 's mini-summit was called by sarkozy , who wants to arrive at a common position on the finance crisis ahead of the oct .
15 eu summit and a g8 meeting to be held in november in the united states .
leaders of the four eu members of the g8 group of leading industrial nations will be present .
joining sarkozy in paris will be german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , along with european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , jean-claude juncker .
the french president will host talks with international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn on saturday ahead of the mini-summit .
france sees the global financial upheavals sparked by the us banking crisis as an opportunity to push for more state regulation of the economy .
strauss-kahn , a former french finance minister , also argued last week that the imf needed to tighten up its control over financial markets in the wake of the crisis .
call for unity french prime minister francois fillon urged europe on friday , oct .
3 , to find a united response to the credit crunch ahead of saturday 's meeting .
" the world is on the edge of the abyss because of an irresponsible system , " fillon told members of france 's governing conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is said to be a brainchild of the dutch prime minister " nicolas sarkozy will reiterate that the only way out of this crisis will be a collective one .
he will propose that europe make its banking systems secure , unfreeze credit and coordinate its economic and monetary strategy , " he added .
but european parliament president hans-gert poettering of germany urged leaders to remember that the weekend mini-summit could only make proposals on how to deal with the global financial crisis . " i want to be clear : the meeting can only be for proposals .
they ca n't decide for the eu .
decisions have to be taken by all 27 -lrb- member -rrb- countries and by the european institutions , " he told an economic conference in madrid .
finance ministers from all member states are due to meet on monday in luxembourg .
supporters and detractors of the bailout fund according to various media reports , the idea of a bailout fund was first suggested to sarkozy by dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a recent meeting , and it was immediately seconded by oecd head angel gurria .
speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "
however , the idea was quickly rejected by berlin , with a spokesman for merkel saying , " i do n't know anyone at the moment who is seriously proposing such a european model . "

washington has approved its historic $ 700-billion bailout package , but eu leaders are divided over what action to take . disagreements , however , center around a plan , reportedly favored by france , to set up a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 415 billion -rrb- fund to help troubled european financial institutions .
in particular , this has provoked tensions between france and germany , who have diverging views of how the european union should function .
berlin is traditionally more opposed to a centralized approach , especially in monetary affairs .
britain , along with germany , has been reluctant to commit taxpayers ' money to a europe-managed fund and advocates a case-by-case approach to rescuing financial institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't quite as cozy between germany and france at the moment saturday 's mini-summit was called by sarkozy , who wants to arrive at a common position on the finance crisis ahead of the oct .
15 eu summit and a g8 meeting to be held in november in the united states .
leaders of the four eu members of the g8 group of leading industrial nations will be present .
joining sarkozy in paris will be german chancellor angela merkel , british prime minister gordon brown and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , along with european commission head jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and the head of the eurogroup , jean-claude juncker .
the french president will host talks with international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn on saturday ahead of the mini-summit .
france sees the global financial upheavals sparked by the us banking crisis as an opportunity to push for more state regulation of the economy .
strauss-kahn , a former french finance minister , also argued last week that the imf needed to tighten up its control over financial markets in the wake of the crisis .
call for unity french prime minister francois fillon urged europe on friday , oct .
3 , to find a united response to the credit crunch ahead of saturday 's meeting .
" the world is on the edge of the abyss because of an irresponsible system , " fillon told members of france 's governing conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is said to be a brainchild of the dutch prime minister " nicolas sarkozy will reiterate that the only way out of this crisis will be a collective one .
he will propose that europe make its banking systems secure , unfreeze credit and coordinate its economic and monetary strategy , " he added .
but european parliament president hans-gert poettering of germany urged leaders to remember that the weekend mini-summit could only make proposals on how to deal with the global financial crisis . " i want to be clear : the meeting can only be for proposals .
they ca n't decide for the eu .
decisions have to be taken by all 27 -lrb- member -rrb- countries and by the european institutions , " he told an economic conference in madrid .
finance ministers from all member states are due to meet on monday in luxembourg .
supporters and detractors of the bailout fund according to various media reports , the idea of a bailout fund was first suggested to sarkozy by dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a recent meeting , and it was immediately seconded by oecd head angel gurria .
speaking in strasbourg on wednesday , gurria said , " we have already seen the first troubled european banks being rescued in the united kingdom , belgium , the netherlands and germany .
" considering the exposure of european financial institutions , we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for europe if things do n't improve on the other side of the atlantic .
the piecemeal approach may not work in europe . "
the proposal was also supported by one of germany 's most influential financiers , deutsche bank head josef ackermann , who said that " such a plan must be available in the drawer , to be prepared for a worst-case scenario . "
however , the idea was quickly rejected by berlin , with a spokesman for merkel saying , " i do n't know anyone at the moment who is seriously proposing such a european model . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck does n't want to let go of the purse strings and a spokesman for finance minister peter steinbrueck said , " the federal government does n't think such plans are good .
tailored solutions are the better way . "
the british prime minister 's spokesman said that while the financial crisis had a " european dimension , " individual countries wanted to come up with their own solution because it is their taxpayers ' money that is at risk .
but the danger of a nationalistic approach to the crisis was made clear earlier in the week , when the irish government decided unilaterally to guarantee all deposits in irish-owned banks for the next two years .
london has been forced to respond after a flight of capital from british lenders to irish banks .
on friday , britain increased the compensation limit for banks savings to 50,000 pounds -lrb- 64,000 euros , $ 88,500 -rrb- in an effort to make its own banks more attractive . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversial package is aimed at buying up the wall street 's bad debts in an effort to ease the credit crunch which is crippling the us economy .
the president said it would take " time and determined effort to get through this difficult period " .
the us house of representatives passed the bill by 263 votes to 171 on friday .
it was the second vote in a week , following the shock rejection of an earlier version of the deal on monday .
the house adopted the new version of the emergency economic stabilization act after the senate added about $ 100bn -lrb- £ 57bn -rrb- in new tax breaks to win republican votes .
job losses the complex process of auctions to buy up the problem assets will be overseen by the us treasury and is not expected to take place for at least a month .
despite the adoption of the bill , share prices in new york ended friday down , as government figures showed us job losses at a five-year high .
mr bush welcomed the approval of the bill , which he said was " essential to helping america 's economy weather the financial crisis " .
the president acknowledged that there were concerns about the government 's role in the deal and its cost .
the passing of the bail-out plan is just the first stage and it will be several months before anyone can tell whether it is working greg wood , bbc business correspondent how will the rescue work ?
stocks trim gains after vote q & a : us $ 700bn bail-out plan he said he believed in intervention only when it was necessary but that " in this situation , action is clearly necessary " .
" ultimately the cost to taxpayers will be far less than the initial outlay , " he said .
fearing a backlash from furious voters in november 's looming congressional elections , politicians were hugely divided on the unpopular bill during the house debate .
some who had voted " no " on monday said they were switching because of the improvements to the bill , but many of them still expressed serious reservations .
others maintained their opposition , saying the bill was still a bail-out benefiting mainly wall street .
' outrage ' both candidates for the us presidential election in november have welcomed the deal but neither were enthusiastic about the details .
speaking in arizona , republican candidate john mccain said the deal " is n't perfect and it 's an outrage that it is even necessary " .

mr mccain said the deal was a temporary solution and it should not take a crisis for congress to reach bi-partisan accord .
democratic candidate barack obama said it was important that the bush administration used the new powers granted by the deal wisely .

zubaydi also took part in the videotaped killing of four russian diplomats in june 2006 , officials say .
