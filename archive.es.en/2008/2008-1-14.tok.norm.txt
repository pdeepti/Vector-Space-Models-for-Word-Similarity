it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .

yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a mountainous country about the size of ireland , the former soviet state sits at the center of a volatile region hosting a pipeline pumping oil from the caspian sea to europe and is the scene of a power struggle between the united states and russia .
saakashvili 's aggressively pro-western agenda has angered russia and former communists in his own country who have opposed his liberal economic policies and reforms - which have attracted sizeable foreign investment and economic growth of up to 12 percent a year - and his push for georgia to become a member of both nato and the european union .
president accused of corruption many georgians say they have missed out on the economic boom that saakashvili , a staunch us ally , claims the country has enjoyed since he swept to power as a result of the so-called " rose revolution , " the peaceful change of political power in 2003 .
saakashvili is accused of running a corrupt , elitist government which has handled the economy poorly .

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

interior ministry spokesperson stefan kaller announced during a press conference in berlin on monday , jan .

according to ndoub , a truck carrying one ton of explosives was said to be on its way to the north german port city of rostock via russia and finland . ndoub allegedly told the embassy that the attacks would be " to avenge " the recent conviction in beirut of one of the attempted german passenger train bombers and the on-going trial in germany of the other . jihad hamad was sentenced in lebanon last month to 12 years imprisonment for his role in the failed july 31 , 2006 , bombings , while youssef al-haj dib is currently still on trial in germany .

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 14.01.2008 opinion : train pay deal a blow to german trade union solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , reached a pay deal with the train drivers ' union after months of wrangling .
it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " stavros dimas told the bbc on monday , jan .
14 . it would be better to miss the target than achieve it by harming the poor or damaging the environment , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has admitted there are problems with the eu 's biofuels policy in march last year , eu leaders agreed that 10 percent of the bloc 's road fuels should come from biofuels by 2020 as part of wider efforts to combat climate change and slash co2 emissions .
that goal was to be anchored in concrete legislation . too many negative consequences ? but criticism has grown steadily in past months about the negative impact of large-scale production of biofuels . critics have warned that expanding the growth of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to environmental damage , drive up food prices and lead companies to drive poor people off their land to convert it to fuel crops . last week , a group of 17 non-governmental organizations sent a letter to eu energy commissioner andreas piebalgs urging him to introduce tougher standards for biofuel production or to give up the planned biofuel targets . they argued that the eu 's draft legislation does not provide protection for important ecosystems , such as savannas or permanent grasslands " that may be threatened by expanding agriculture to meet the eu 's biofuel target . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear that biofuels is leading to loss of forest cover in some countries " destruction of these carbon sinks would lead to large emissions of carbon into the atmosphere , thereby reducing or neutralizing the benefits from growing biofuels .
neither does the draft text provide any safeguards to protect water and soil resources , " the letter said . last september , the eu 's biofuel targets were sharply criticized by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , a group made up of the world 's 30 most developed countries . the paris-based oecd said that state subsidies for biofuels would distort food prices and damage natural habitats while its impacts on combating climate change may be limited . guidelines may be altered dimas has said it 's vital for the eu 's rules to prevent the loss of biodiversity , suggesting that the draft legislation could be altered . " we have to have criteria for sustainability , including social and environmental issues , because there are some benefits from biofuels , " he added . dimas said the eu would introduce a certification scheme for biofuels and vowed to clamp down on biodiesel from palm oil , which is believed to be causing widespread forest destruction in indonesia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.01.2008 waning press freedom in indonesia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indonesian media are some of the most free in asia but journalists fear this is changing since the collapse of suharto 's regime in 1998 , a multi-faceted and lively media landscape has developed in indonesia , which is one of the most free in asia .
censorship and the shutting down of newspapers have become a thing of the past and a 1999 press law was a great milestone for the young democracy .
however , the increasing influence of media moguls are posing new challenges . the figures are worrying .
last year , attacks on journalists rose from 53 in 2006 to 75 .
that 's the result heru hendratmoko , the president of aji , the alliance of independent journalists , recently presented in indonesia 's capital jakarta .
the alliance monitors the indonesian media - physical attacks , threats and legal complaints against journalists are on the up .
many journalists are worried about growing legal uncertainty .
in 1999 , the information ministry , which had exercised a strict control of the media , was shut down and a national press law was introduced to protect media freedom .
however , heru hendratmoko says this is being used less and less and that when there are cases involving journalists , " the judge , prosecutors and police always use criminal code articles .
that 's why there are still many journalists facing the courts after writing on certain issues such as corruption . "
" that 's why we 're complaining to the police , to the prosecutors , to the judges , that they should use the press law instead of the criminal code , but these complaints have been falling on deaf ears .
hendratmoko fears the government wants to roll back press freedom because at the moment it has no authority to interfere with the media .
jailed in yogjakarta the most recent example of the criminal code being used against journalists is the case of the chief editor of the newspaper " radar yogya " in the central javanese city of yogjakarta .
" one of our journalists in yogjakarta was accused of defamation for writing about a local businessman who also owned the local newspaper , " explained eko maryadi , the indonesia correspondent for reporters without borders .
" apparently , the guy is also the second king of jogjakarta - he was unhappy about the reporting of the media and made a lawsuit against our colleague , who now has to serve six months in prison because of the supreme court 's decision . "
media tycoons media tycoons control large sectors of the market as well as the content - they do not value investigative journalism .
bambang harymurti found this out for himself .
the chief editor of tempo , the country 's most important news magazine , was sued a few years ago for his reporting on the dubious business practices of tommy winata , a businessman and media tsar .
harymurti was even handed a jail sentence but this was never enforced .
he continued to publish reports criticising corruption and nepotism but he is sceptical about current developments .
" i 'm worried that media are interested in doing really investigative -lsb- journalism -rsb- .
one : because of the risk and two : because of the ownership of the media , especially in the electronic media , which are owned by just a few business people with their own interests .
although they are the ones who have the resources to carry out investigative journalism . "
heru hendratmoko from the alliance of independent journalists the problem is exacerbated by a lack of professionalism among indonesian journalists and the fact that they are incredibly underpaid .
although some media outlets are doing their best to do quality reporting , he says there needs to be a code of ethics , more money and more legal protection if the overall quality of content in the indonesian media is to improve . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic journalists want the press freedom law to be implemented more 05 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 14.01.2008 microsoft target of new eu antitrust probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's internet browser is under scrutiny bill gates must have thought that paying the eu 's 497-million-euro fine for monopoly abuse in september was an expensive end to an embarrassing affair .
but the eu has software giant microsoft firmly in its sights again . just when microsoft thought it was safe to go back into europe , the european commission opened a new antitrust probe into the us software giant , accusing bill gates ' company of unfairly obstructing the ability of rival applications to work on its operating systems . the probe was opened after the commission received two official complaints ; one from opera , a norwegian maker of a web browser which competes with microsoft 's internet explorer , and another from the european committee for interoperable systems -lrb- ecis -rrb- , an industry group which claimed microsoft did not disclose enough interoperability information for its range of products . " the -lsb- opera -rsb- complaint alleges that there is ongoing competitive harm from microsoft 's practices , in particular in view of new proprietary technologies that microsoft has allegedly introduced in its browser that would reduce compatibility with open internet standards , and therefore hinder competition , " the commission statement read . " in addition , allegations of tying of other separate software products by microsoft , including desktop search and windows live have been brought to the commission 's attention , " it added .
" the commission 's investigation will therefore focus on allegations that a range of products have been unlawfully tied to sales of microsoft 's dominant operating system . " " in the complaint by ecis , microsoft is alleged to have illegally refused to disclose interoperability information across a broad range of products , including information related to its office suite , a number of its server products , and also in relation to the so-called .net framework , " the commission statement continued . " the commission 's examination will therefore focus on all these areas , including the question whether microsoft 's new file format office open xml , as implemented in office , is sufficiently interoperable with competitors ' products . " no evidence so far while the probe could mean further bad news for microsoft in europe , the european commission made it clear that it did not have any evidence of wrong-doing and that it was , at this stage , just investigating the complaints . " this initiation of proceedings does not imply that the commission has proof of an infringement , " the commission said .
" it only signifies that the commission will further investigate the case as a matter of priority .
microsoft was hit by a fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- in september last year after europe 's second-highest court dismissed the company 's appeal against an eu antitrust decision , taken in 2004 .
the court of first instance upheld the commission 's conclusion that microsoft had been guilty of monopoly abuse and had taken advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . microsoft pledged in october to give third party program developers access to information that will allow them to make systems interoperable with windows .
it also said it would substantially cut the fees it charges for such data . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

a mountainous country about the size of ireland , the former soviet state sits at the center of a volatile region hosting a pipeline pumping oil from the caspian sea to europe and is the scene of a power struggle between the united states and russia .
saakashvili 's aggressively pro-western agenda has angered russia and former communists in his own country who have opposed his liberal economic policies and reforms - which have attracted sizeable foreign investment and economic growth of up to 12 percent a year - and his push for georgia to become a member of both nato and the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 14.01.2008 opinion : train pay deal a blow to german trade union solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , reached a pay deal with the train drivers ' union after months of wrangling .
it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

but the eu has software giant microsoft firmly in its sights again . just when microsoft thought it was safe to go back into europe , the european commission opened a new antitrust probe into the us software giant , accusing bill gates ' company of unfairly obstructing the ability of rival applications to work on its operating systems . the probe was opened after the commission received two official complaints ; one from opera , a norwegian maker of a web browser which competes with microsoft 's internet explorer , and another from the european committee for interoperable systems -lrb- ecis -rrb- , an industry group which claimed microsoft did not disclose enough interoperability information for its range of products .

but the eu has software giant microsoft firmly in its sights again . just when microsoft thought it was safe to go back into europe , the european commission opened a new antitrust probe into the us software giant , accusing bill gates ' company of unfairly obstructing the ability of rival applications to work on its operating systems . the probe was opened after the commission received two official complaints ; one from opera , a norwegian maker of a web browser which competes with microsoft 's internet explorer , and another from the european committee for interoperable systems -lrb- ecis -rrb- , an industry group which claimed microsoft did not disclose enough interoperability information for its range of products . " the -lsb- opera -rsb- complaint alleges that there is ongoing competitive harm from microsoft 's practices , in particular in view of new proprietary technologies that microsoft has allegedly introduced in its browser that would reduce compatibility with open internet standards , and therefore hinder competition , " the commission statement read . " in addition , allegations of tying of other separate software products by microsoft , including desktop search and windows live have been brought to the commission 's attention , " it added .
" the commission 's investigation will therefore focus on allegations that a range of products have been unlawfully tied to sales of microsoft 's dominant operating system . " " in the complaint by ecis , microsoft is alleged to have illegally refused to disclose interoperability information across a broad range of products , including information related to its office suite , a number of its server products , and also in relation to the so-called .net framework , " the commission statement continued . " the commission 's examination will therefore focus on all these areas , including the question whether microsoft 's new file format office open xml , as implemented in office , is sufficiently interoperable with competitors ' products . " no evidence so far while the probe could mean further bad news for microsoft in europe , the european commission made it clear that it did not have any evidence of wrong-doing and that it was , at this stage , just investigating the complaints . " this initiation of proceedings does not imply that the commission has proof of an infringement , " the commission said .
" it only signifies that the commission will further investigate the case as a matter of priority .
microsoft was hit by a fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- in september last year after europe 's second-highest court dismissed the company 's appeal against an eu antitrust decision , taken in 2004 .
the court of first instance upheld the commission 's conclusion that microsoft had been guilty of monopoly abuse and had taken advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . microsoft pledged in october to give third party program developers access to information that will allow them to make systems interoperable with windows .
it also said it would substantially cut the fees it charges for such data . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " stavros dimas told the bbc on monday , jan .
14 . it would be better to miss the target than achieve it by harming the poor or damaging the environment , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has admitted there are problems with the eu 's biofuels policy in march last year , eu leaders agreed that 10 percent of the bloc 's road fuels should come from biofuels by 2020 as part of wider efforts to combat climate change and slash co2 emissions .
that goal was to be anchored in concrete legislation . too many negative consequences ? but criticism has grown steadily in past months about the negative impact of large-scale production of biofuels . critics have warned that expanding the growth of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to environmental damage , drive up food prices and lead companies to drive poor people off their land to convert it to fuel crops . last week , a group of 17 non-governmental organizations sent a letter to eu energy commissioner andreas piebalgs urging him to introduce tougher standards for biofuel production or to give up the planned biofuel targets . they argued that the eu 's draft legislation does not provide protection for important ecosystems , such as savannas or permanent grasslands " that may be threatened by expanding agriculture to meet the eu 's biofuel target . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear that biofuels is leading to loss of forest cover in some countries " destruction of these carbon sinks would lead to large emissions of carbon into the atmosphere , thereby reducing or neutralizing the benefits from growing biofuels .
neither does the draft text provide any safeguards to protect water and soil resources , " the letter said . last september , the eu 's biofuel targets were sharply criticized by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , a group made up of the world 's 30 most developed countries . the paris-based oecd said that state subsidies for biofuels would distort food prices and damage natural habitats while its impacts on combating climate change may be limited . guidelines may be altered dimas has said it 's vital for the eu 's rules to prevent the loss of biodiversity , suggesting that the draft legislation could be altered . " we have to have criteria for sustainability , including social and environmental issues , because there are some benefits from biofuels , " he added . dimas said the eu would introduce a certification scheme for biofuels and vowed to clamp down on biodiesel from palm oil , which is believed to be causing widespread forest destruction in indonesia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the saakashvili regime will not be able to lead the country for long .

saakashvili 's aggressively pro-western agenda has angered russia and former communists in his own country who have opposed his liberal economic policies and reforms - which have attracted sizeable foreign investment and economic growth of up to 12 percent a year - and his push for georgia to become a member of both nato and the european union .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .

bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .

the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.01.2008 germany downgrades terror alert after ministry bomb threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the us , germany is not at high risk , government officials say since germany moved into the crosshairs of islamist terrorists , a number of threats have been made against the country 's infrastructure and people .
the latest has been investigated and revealed as less than credible . after receiving a threat of a possible attack against the federal justice ministry last week , german security officials have scaled down their terror warning .
interior ministry spokesperson stefan kaller announced during a press conference in berlin on monday , jan .
14 , that there was a " lower degree of seriousness " in terms of likely terror attacks on german soil . the german press reported over the weekend that al qaeda sympathizers were allegedly planning terrorist attacks in germany following the recent arrest of a number of suspected islamist terrorists . lebanese security officials had reportedly warned german authorities of possible revenge terror acts by a group affiliated to al qaeda on various sites , among them the german justice ministry , military facilities and other government buildings . suspect arrested for phone threat the tip-off came after mohammed ndoub , a syrian national , was arrested by lebanese authorities after issuing the threats to the german embassy in beirut via a public telephone .
according to ndoub , a truck carrying one ton of explosives was said to be on its way to the north german port city of rostock via russia and finland . ndoub allegedly told the embassy that the attacks would be " to avenge " the recent conviction in beirut of one of the attempted german passenger train bombers and the on-going trial in germany of the other . jihad hamad was sentenced in lebanon last month to 12 years imprisonment for his role in the failed july 31 , 2006 , bombings , while youssef al-haj dib is currently still on trial in germany .
both are accused of conspiring to blow up busy commuter trains near hamm and koblenz with home-made gas canister bombs hidden in luggage .
the bombs failed to detonate owing to technical faults .
bka rules out an attack after receiving information meanwhile , sandra clemens , a spokeswoman for the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the security service also " ruled out " a terror attack . " an attack can be ruled out on the basis of the information we have at our disposal , " clemens said in a statement from the bka headquarters in wiesbaden .
she did not provide any further details . reports carried by a number of news agencies suggest that a lebanese security official had confirmed that further interrogations of suspects had revealed that the threat was less serious than initially thought . " the telephone threat had no value and it was not serious , " the official is reported to have said .
" ndoub is still under arrest over other matters that have nothing to do with the telephone threat . " ndoub remains in custody in beirut under suspicion of involvement in local criminal activity . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 14.01.2008 microsoft target of new eu antitrust probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's internet browser is under scrutiny bill gates must have thought that paying the eu 's 497-million-euro fine for monopoly abuse in september was an expensive end to an embarrassing affair .
but the eu has software giant microsoft firmly in its sights again . just when microsoft thought it was safe to go back into europe , the european commission opened a new antitrust probe into the us software giant , accusing bill gates ' company of unfairly obstructing the ability of rival applications to work on its operating systems . the probe was opened after the commission received two official complaints ; one from opera , a norwegian maker of a web browser which competes with microsoft 's internet explorer , and another from the european committee for interoperable systems -lrb- ecis -rrb- , an industry group which claimed microsoft did not disclose enough interoperability information for its range of products . " the -lsb- opera -rsb- complaint alleges that there is ongoing competitive harm from microsoft 's practices , in particular in view of new proprietary technologies that microsoft has allegedly introduced in its browser that would reduce compatibility with open internet standards , and therefore hinder competition , " the commission statement read . " in addition , allegations of tying of other separate software products by microsoft , including desktop search and windows live have been brought to the commission 's attention , " it added .
" the commission 's investigation will therefore focus on allegations that a range of products have been unlawfully tied to sales of microsoft 's dominant operating system . " " in the complaint by ecis , microsoft is alleged to have illegally refused to disclose interoperability information across a broad range of products , including information related to its office suite , a number of its server products , and also in relation to the so-called .net framework , " the commission statement continued . " the commission 's examination will therefore focus on all these areas , including the question whether microsoft 's new file format office open xml , as implemented in office , is sufficiently interoperable with competitors ' products . " no evidence so far while the probe could mean further bad news for microsoft in europe , the european commission made it clear that it did not have any evidence of wrong-doing and that it was , at this stage , just investigating the complaints . " this initiation of proceedings does not imply that the commission has proof of an infringement , " the commission said .
" it only signifies that the commission will further investigate the case as a matter of priority .
microsoft was hit by a fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- in september last year after europe 's second-highest court dismissed the company 's appeal against an eu antitrust decision , taken in 2004 .
the court of first instance upheld the commission 's conclusion that microsoft had been guilty of monopoly abuse and had taken advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . microsoft pledged in october to give third party program developers access to information that will allow them to make systems interoperable with windows .
it also said it would substantially cut the fees it charges for such data . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.01.2008 germany downgrades terror alert after ministry bomb threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the us , germany is not at high risk , government officials say since germany moved into the crosshairs of islamist terrorists , a number of threats have been made against the country 's infrastructure and people .
the latest has been investigated and revealed as less than credible . after receiving a threat of a possible attack against the federal justice ministry last week , german security officials have scaled down their terror warning .
interior ministry spokesperson stefan kaller announced during a press conference in berlin on monday , jan .
14 , that there was a " lower degree of seriousness " in terms of likely terror attacks on german soil . the german press reported over the weekend that al qaeda sympathizers were allegedly planning terrorist attacks in germany following the recent arrest of a number of suspected islamist terrorists . lebanese security officials had reportedly warned german authorities of possible revenge terror acts by a group affiliated to al qaeda on various sites , among them the german justice ministry , military facilities and other government buildings . suspect arrested for phone threat the tip-off came after mohammed ndoub , a syrian national , was arrested by lebanese authorities after issuing the threats to the german embassy in beirut via a public telephone .
according to ndoub , a truck carrying one ton of explosives was said to be on its way to the north german port city of rostock via russia and finland . ndoub allegedly told the embassy that the attacks would be " to avenge " the recent conviction in beirut of one of the attempted german passenger train bombers and the on-going trial in germany of the other . jihad hamad was sentenced in lebanon last month to 12 years imprisonment for his role in the failed july 31 , 2006 , bombings , while youssef al-haj dib is currently still on trial in germany .
both are accused of conspiring to blow up busy commuter trains near hamm and koblenz with home-made gas canister bombs hidden in luggage .
the bombs failed to detonate owing to technical faults .
bka rules out an attack after receiving information meanwhile , sandra clemens , a spokeswoman for the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the security service also " ruled out " a terror attack . " an attack can be ruled out on the basis of the information we have at our disposal , " clemens said in a statement from the bka headquarters in wiesbaden .
she did not provide any further details . reports carried by a number of news agencies suggest that a lebanese security official had confirmed that further interrogations of suspects had revealed that the threat was less serious than initially thought . " the telephone threat had no value and it was not serious , " the official is reported to have said .
" ndoub is still under arrest over other matters that have nothing to do with the telephone threat . " ndoub remains in custody in beirut under suspicion of involvement in local criminal activity . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 14.01.2008 opinion : train pay deal a blow to german trade union solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , reached a pay deal with the train drivers ' union after months of wrangling .
it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

censorship and the shutting down of newspapers have become a thing of the past and a 1999 press law was a great milestone for the young democracy .
however , the increasing influence of media moguls are posing new challenges . the figures are worrying .
last year , attacks on journalists rose from 53 in 2006 to 75 .
that 's the result heru hendratmoko , the president of aji , the alliance of independent journalists , recently presented in indonesia 's capital jakarta .
the alliance monitors the indonesian media - physical attacks , threats and legal complaints against journalists are on the up .
many journalists are worried about growing legal uncertainty .
in 1999 , the information ministry , which had exercised a strict control of the media , was shut down and a national press law was introduced to protect media freedom .
however , heru hendratmoko says this is being used less and less and that when there are cases involving journalists , " the judge , prosecutors and police always use criminal code articles .
that 's why there are still many journalists facing the courts after writing on certain issues such as corruption . "
" that 's why we 're complaining to the police , to the prosecutors , to the judges , that they should use the press law instead of the criminal code , but these complaints have been falling on deaf ears .
hendratmoko fears the government wants to roll back press freedom because at the moment it has no authority to interfere with the media .
jailed in yogjakarta the most recent example of the criminal code being used against journalists is the case of the chief editor of the newspaper " radar yogya " in the central javanese city of yogjakarta .
" one of our journalists in yogjakarta was accused of defamation for writing about a local businessman who also owned the local newspaper , " explained eko maryadi , the indonesia correspondent for reporters without borders .
" apparently , the guy is also the second king of jogjakarta - he was unhappy about the reporting of the media and made a lawsuit against our colleague , who now has to serve six months in prison because of the supreme court 's decision . "
media tycoons media tycoons control large sectors of the market as well as the content - they do not value investigative journalism .
bambang harymurti found this out for himself .
the chief editor of tempo , the country 's most important news magazine , was sued a few years ago for his reporting on the dubious business practices of tommy winata , a businessman and media tsar .
harymurti was even handed a jail sentence but this was never enforced .
he continued to publish reports criticising corruption and nepotism but he is sceptical about current developments .
" i 'm worried that media are interested in doing really investigative -lsb- journalism -rsb- .
one : because of the risk and two : because of the ownership of the media , especially in the electronic media , which are owned by just a few business people with their own interests .
although they are the ones who have the resources to carry out investigative journalism . "
heru hendratmoko from the alliance of independent journalists the problem is exacerbated by a lack of professionalism among indonesian journalists and the fact that they are incredibly underpaid .
although some media outlets are doing their best to do quality reporting , he says there needs to be a code of ethics , more money and more legal protection if the overall quality of content in the indonesian media is to improve . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic journalists want the press freedom law to be implemented more media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the eu has software giant microsoft firmly in its sights again . just when microsoft thought it was safe to go back into europe , the european commission opened a new antitrust probe into the us software giant , accusing bill gates ' company of unfairly obstructing the ability of rival applications to work on its operating systems . the probe was opened after the commission received two official complaints ; one from opera , a norwegian maker of a web browser which competes with microsoft 's internet explorer , and another from the european committee for interoperable systems -lrb- ecis -rrb- , an industry group which claimed microsoft did not disclose enough interoperability information for its range of products .

" the commission 's investigation will therefore focus on allegations that a range of products have been unlawfully tied to sales of microsoft 's dominant operating system . " " in the complaint by ecis , microsoft is alleged to have illegally refused to disclose interoperability information across a broad range of products , including information related to its office suite , a number of its server products , and also in relation to the so-called .net framework , " the commission statement continued . " the commission 's examination will therefore focus on all these areas , including the question whether microsoft 's new file format office open xml , as implemented in office , is sufficiently interoperable with competitors ' products . " no evidence so far while the probe could mean further bad news for microsoft in europe , the european commission made it clear that it did not have any evidence of wrong-doing and that it was , at this stage , just investigating the complaints . " this initiation of proceedings does not imply that the commission has proof of an infringement , " the commission said .
" it only signifies that the commission will further investigate the case as a matter of priority .
microsoft was hit by a fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- in september last year after europe 's second-highest court dismissed the company 's appeal against an eu antitrust decision , taken in 2004 .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

president accused of corruption many georgians say they have missed out on the economic boom that saakashvili , a staunch us ally , claims the country has enjoyed since he swept to power as a result of the so-called " rose revolution , " the peaceful change of political power in 2003 .
saakashvili is accused of running a corrupt , elitist government which has handled the economy poorly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the protestors claim saakashvili is corrupt saakashvili 's supporters say the opposition 's accusation that the presidential vote was fixed is just the bleating of desperate opponents who know they have lost .
the election and the protests are being held up as evidence of how divided the georgian population has become since electing saakashvili president with around 96 percent support in 2004 .
saakashvili is to be sworn in to a new term of office either on jan .

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

dw-world.de deutsche bahn strikes pay deal with train drivers deutsche bahn , germany 's state-owned railway , reached an agreement on pay and working hours with the gdl train drivers ' union , ending 10 months of wrangling and a wave of crippling strikes .

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

it would be laughable if it did n't happen every other month .
this time , bavaria and rhineland-palatinate are getting all steamed up over a dumpling . one of the best ways of celebrating your survival after completing a hair-raising descent of an icy piste is to shed your skies or snowboard and get stuck into a dampfnudel .
while literally translating to steamed noodle , it 's essentially a massive dumpling , served either in savoury or sweet form .
it can be the best way of reaffirming life after partaking of death-defying winter sports .
combined with a bucketload of après-ski alcohol , the dampfnudel makes everything good in the wintery world . such a culinary treat should be treasured , and the dampfnudel is certainly championed as a fine example of the german kitchen in the places where it is held most dear .
but , as with most things coveted by the many , it is fiercely defended by the few . instead of devouring the monstrous ball of dough with vigor – or with either mushrooms in white sauce or custard and jam , depending on your taste – the good people of bavaria and rhineland palatinate are channelling their energies into slagging each other off over the origin of the dampfnudel . arguments over food and drink are not a new thing in germany .
most recently , the berliners have had to defend their currywurst against covetous northerners while the people of hesse almost came to blows with brussels over their apfelwein .
so , apart from it all being rather petty and unseemly , what 's the deal with this new outbreak of culinary hostilities ? bavarians stake claim on the web well , as with most food fights it all stems from perceived ownership and the regional pride a particular food can instil .
the bavarians have stolen a march on the rhineland folk by proclaiming on the electronic oracle of all that is truthful -lrb- the internet to the rest of us -rrb- that the dampfnudel is a speciality of bavaria .
the rhinelanders fear that this will lead to their rivals to the south staking a claim for ownership of the dumpling at an eu level . " we will not allow them to take the dampfnudel without a fight , " proclaimed rhineland-palatinate 's minister of agriculture hendrik hering in a local newspaper article on the growing crisis .
he added that all judicial and diplomatic efforts would be employed in keeping the origin of the dampfnudel associated with the rhineland . rhinelanders expose rivals as culinary magpies on first glance , the rhinelanders may appear to be the antagonists here .
the bavarians have done nothing other than stake a claim , rightly or wrongly , to something they believe to be theirs .
but on further investigation , it appears that bavaria has form when it comes to snaffling other regions ' delicacies and calling them their own . glancing at the offending internet site , " food from bavaria , " there are the obvious specialities from that most proud region of germany : the veal sausage , abensberger asparagus and hefeweizen wheat beer among them .
but since when did swabian maultaschen , the oversized savoury-stuffed pillows from neighbouring baden-württemberg , come from bavaria ?
how long have the swabian spätzle noodles been a bavarian invention ? digging deeper , one can see that maybe the rhineland has a point … dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.01.2008 eu rethinks biofuels targets as criticism mounts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's embrace of biofuels has come in for criticism the eu has admitted that it failed to foresee problems raised by its policy to encourage motorists in europe to drive vehicles which run on fuels derived from plants as part of efforts to cut carbon emissions . the european union 's environment chief said the bloc would rethink new draft rules on boosting the production of biofuels amid growing criticism by green campaign groups that the move could lead to rainforest destruction and social dislocation . " we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " stavros dimas told the bbc on monday , jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.01.2008 germany downgrades terror alert after ministry bomb threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the us , germany is not at high risk , government officials say since germany moved into the crosshairs of islamist terrorists , a number of threats have been made against the country 's infrastructure and people .
the latest has been investigated and revealed as less than credible . after receiving a threat of a possible attack against the federal justice ministry last week , german security officials have scaled down their terror warning .
interior ministry spokesperson stefan kaller announced during a press conference in berlin on monday , jan .
14 , that there was a " lower degree of seriousness " in terms of likely terror attacks on german soil . the german press reported over the weekend that al qaeda sympathizers were allegedly planning terrorist attacks in germany following the recent arrest of a number of suspected islamist terrorists . lebanese security officials had reportedly warned german authorities of possible revenge terror acts by a group affiliated to al qaeda on various sites , among them the german justice ministry , military facilities and other government buildings . suspect arrested for phone threat the tip-off came after mohammed ndoub , a syrian national , was arrested by lebanese authorities after issuing the threats to the german embassy in beirut via a public telephone .
according to ndoub , a truck carrying one ton of explosives was said to be on its way to the north german port city of rostock via russia and finland . ndoub allegedly told the embassy that the attacks would be " to avenge " the recent conviction in beirut of one of the attempted german passenger train bombers and the on-going trial in germany of the other . jihad hamad was sentenced in lebanon last month to 12 years imprisonment for his role in the failed july 31 , 2006 , bombings , while youssef al-haj dib is currently still on trial in germany .
both are accused of conspiring to blow up busy commuter trains near hamm and koblenz with home-made gas canister bombs hidden in luggage .
the bombs failed to detonate owing to technical faults .
bka rules out an attack after receiving information meanwhile , sandra clemens , a spokeswoman for the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the security service also " ruled out " a terror attack . " an attack can be ruled out on the basis of the information we have at our disposal , " clemens said in a statement from the bka headquarters in wiesbaden .
she did not provide any further details . reports carried by a number of news agencies suggest that a lebanese security official had confirmed that further interrogations of suspects had revealed that the threat was less serious than initially thought . " the telephone threat had no value and it was not serious , " the official is reported to have said .
" ndoub is still under arrest over other matters that have nothing to do with the telephone threat . " ndoub remains in custody in beirut under suspicion of involvement in local criminal activity . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

a mountainous country about the size of ireland , the former soviet state sits at the center of a volatile region hosting a pipeline pumping oil from the caspian sea to europe and is the scene of a power struggle between the united states and russia .
saakashvili 's aggressively pro-western agenda has angered russia and former communists in his own country who have opposed his liberal economic policies and reforms - which have attracted sizeable foreign investment and economic growth of up to 12 percent a year - and his push for georgia to become a member of both nato and the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.01.2008 germany downgrades terror alert after ministry bomb threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the us , germany is not at high risk , government officials say since germany moved into the crosshairs of islamist terrorists , a number of threats have been made against the country 's infrastructure and people .
the latest has been investigated and revealed as less than credible . after receiving a threat of a possible attack against the federal justice ministry last week , german security officials have scaled down their terror warning .
interior ministry spokesperson stefan kaller announced during a press conference in berlin on monday , jan .
14 , that there was a " lower degree of seriousness " in terms of likely terror attacks on german soil . the german press reported over the weekend that al qaeda sympathizers were allegedly planning terrorist attacks in germany following the recent arrest of a number of suspected islamist terrorists . lebanese security officials had reportedly warned german authorities of possible revenge terror acts by a group affiliated to al qaeda on various sites , among them the german justice ministry , military facilities and other government buildings . suspect arrested for phone threat the tip-off came after mohammed ndoub , a syrian national , was arrested by lebanese authorities after issuing the threats to the german embassy in beirut via a public telephone .
according to ndoub , a truck carrying one ton of explosives was said to be on its way to the north german port city of rostock via russia and finland . ndoub allegedly told the embassy that the attacks would be " to avenge " the recent conviction in beirut of one of the attempted german passenger train bombers and the on-going trial in germany of the other . jihad hamad was sentenced in lebanon last month to 12 years imprisonment for his role in the failed july 31 , 2006 , bombings , while youssef al-haj dib is currently still on trial in germany .
both are accused of conspiring to blow up busy commuter trains near hamm and koblenz with home-made gas canister bombs hidden in luggage .
the bombs failed to detonate owing to technical faults .
bka rules out an attack after receiving information meanwhile , sandra clemens , a spokeswoman for the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the security service also " ruled out " a terror attack . " an attack can be ruled out on the basis of the information we have at our disposal , " clemens said in a statement from the bka headquarters in wiesbaden .
she did not provide any further details . reports carried by a number of news agencies suggest that a lebanese security official had confirmed that further interrogations of suspects had revealed that the threat was less serious than initially thought . " the telephone threat had no value and it was not serious , " the official is reported to have said .
" ndoub is still under arrest over other matters that have nothing to do with the telephone threat . " ndoub remains in custody in beirut under suspicion of involvement in local criminal activity . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

but the eu has software giant microsoft firmly in its sights again . just when microsoft thought it was safe to go back into europe , the european commission opened a new antitrust probe into the us software giant , accusing bill gates ' company of unfairly obstructing the ability of rival applications to work on its operating systems . the probe was opened after the commission received two official complaints ; one from opera , a norwegian maker of a web browser which competes with microsoft 's internet explorer , and another from the european committee for interoperable systems -lrb- ecis -rrb- , an industry group which claimed microsoft did not disclose enough interoperability information for its range of products . " the -lsb- opera -rsb- complaint alleges that there is ongoing competitive harm from microsoft 's practices , in particular in view of new proprietary technologies that microsoft has allegedly introduced in its browser that would reduce compatibility with open internet standards , and therefore hinder competition , " the commission statement read . " in addition , allegations of tying of other separate software products by microsoft , including desktop search and windows live have been brought to the commission 's attention , " it added .
" the commission 's investigation will therefore focus on allegations that a range of products have been unlawfully tied to sales of microsoft 's dominant operating system . " " in the complaint by ecis , microsoft is alleged to have illegally refused to disclose interoperability information across a broad range of products , including information related to its office suite , a number of its server products , and also in relation to the so-called .net framework , " the commission statement continued . " the commission 's examination will therefore focus on all these areas , including the question whether microsoft 's new file format office open xml , as implemented in office , is sufficiently interoperable with competitors ' products . " no evidence so far while the probe could mean further bad news for microsoft in europe , the european commission made it clear that it did not have any evidence of wrong-doing and that it was , at this stage , just investigating the complaints . " this initiation of proceedings does not imply that the commission has proof of an infringement , " the commission said .
" it only signifies that the commission will further investigate the case as a matter of priority .
microsoft was hit by a fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- in september last year after europe 's second-highest court dismissed the company 's appeal against an eu antitrust decision , taken in 2004 .
the court of first instance upheld the commission 's conclusion that microsoft had been guilty of monopoly abuse and had taken advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . microsoft pledged in october to give third party program developers access to information that will allow them to make systems interoperable with windows .
it also said it would substantially cut the fees it charges for such data . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .

13 .
pay will be further raised to 11 percent in september .
deutsche bahn also agreed to cut the workweek to 40 hours from 41 hours starting in february 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell has led often acrimonious negotiations with deutsche bahn " it 's a good result with which we can live well , " schell said , adding he was optimistic about settling the final details of the wage contract which will expire at the end of january 2009 .
he added that the union had unanimously voted sunday to halt preparations for more stoppages that would have choked deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services across the country .
this meant " with a likelihood of 99 percent , " there would be no more strikes , he said . " good news for german economy " the gdl had been threatening to the last to resume strikes , prompting the government of chancellor angela merkel to mediate in the dispute , although it normally leaves the state-owned railways company to run itself .
the pay deal is expected to bring relief to germany , which has seen massive disruptions of cargo and passenger traffic as a result of work stoppages in the past months , costing europe 's largest economy millions of euros .
neighboring european countries were also hit by the strike .
bildunterschrift : the strikes caused major disruptions in passenger traffic in recent months german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee called the agreement of " eminent importance to the german economy . "
economics expert hans-werner sinn said the deal between deutsche bahn and the gdl was positive .
" the end of the awful row is good news for germany 's economy , " he told the bild newspaper .
breaking ranks the bitter labor dispute erupted 10 months ago when schell 's gdl union demanded a raise of as much as 31 percent for some 20,000 train drivers and 10,000 ticketing staff , saying they were paid miserably .
train drivers in germany earn about 1,500 euros a month after taxes , less than their counterparts in neighboring france and switzerland , according to the union .
gdl 's demands represented a challenge to germany 's trade-union solidarity and the unraveling of a system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
companies fear the settlement may encourage other german unions to step up pay claims amid widespread sentiment that labor has missed out during germany 's economic recovery . commentators have said in the past that gains for the drivers would trigger claims by other workers at the company , leading to increases in german passenger fares and freight charges .
deutsche bahn reached a deal in november with the 135,000 workers in the transnet and gdba unions to increase their salaries by 10 percent through 2010 .
public sector strikes loom even as germany 's long-running acrimonious pay dispute between deutsche bahn and train drivers may finally be over , representatives of about 1.3 million public sector workers are also warning of industrial action to back up their push for a 8-percent pay rise .
but economists warn that a big hike in wages could place at risk germany 's recent economic success , which resulted in growth climbing to 2.9 percent in 2006 , and which to an extent was based on the nation 's improved competitiveness resulting from the long run of stagnating wages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " stavros dimas told the bbc on monday , jan .
14 . it would be better to miss the target than achieve it by harming the poor or damaging the environment , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has admitted there are problems with the eu 's biofuels policy in march last year , eu leaders agreed that 10 percent of the bloc 's road fuels should come from biofuels by 2020 as part of wider efforts to combat climate change and slash co2 emissions .
that goal was to be anchored in concrete legislation . too many negative consequences ? but criticism has grown steadily in past months about the negative impact of large-scale production of biofuels . critics have warned that expanding the growth of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to environmental damage , drive up food prices and lead companies to drive poor people off their land to convert it to fuel crops . last week , a group of 17 non-governmental organizations sent a letter to eu energy commissioner andreas piebalgs urging him to introduce tougher standards for biofuel production or to give up the planned biofuel targets . they argued that the eu 's draft legislation does not provide protection for important ecosystems , such as savannas or permanent grasslands " that may be threatened by expanding agriculture to meet the eu 's biofuel target . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear that biofuels is leading to loss of forest cover in some countries " destruction of these carbon sinks would lead to large emissions of carbon into the atmosphere , thereby reducing or neutralizing the benefits from growing biofuels .
neither does the draft text provide any safeguards to protect water and soil resources , " the letter said . last september , the eu 's biofuel targets were sharply criticized by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , a group made up of the world 's 30 most developed countries . the paris-based oecd said that state subsidies for biofuels would distort food prices and damage natural habitats while its impacts on combating climate change may be limited . guidelines may be altered dimas has said it 's vital for the eu 's rules to prevent the loss of biodiversity , suggesting that the draft legislation could be altered . " we have to have criteria for sustainability , including social and environmental issues , because there are some benefits from biofuels , " he added . dimas said the eu would introduce a certification scheme for biofuels and vowed to clamp down on biodiesel from palm oil , which is believed to be causing widespread forest destruction in indonesia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the eu has software giant microsoft firmly in its sights again . just when microsoft thought it was safe to go back into europe , the european commission opened a new antitrust probe into the us software giant , accusing bill gates ' company of unfairly obstructing the ability of rival applications to work on its operating systems . the probe was opened after the commission received two official complaints ; one from opera , a norwegian maker of a web browser which competes with microsoft 's internet explorer , and another from the european committee for interoperable systems -lrb- ecis -rrb- , an industry group which claimed microsoft did not disclose enough interoperability information for its range of products . " the -lsb- opera -rsb- complaint alleges that there is ongoing competitive harm from microsoft 's practices , in particular in view of new proprietary technologies that microsoft has allegedly introduced in its browser that would reduce compatibility with open internet standards , and therefore hinder competition , " the commission statement read . " in addition , allegations of tying of other separate software products by microsoft , including desktop search and windows live have been brought to the commission 's attention , " it added .
" the commission 's investigation will therefore focus on allegations that a range of products have been unlawfully tied to sales of microsoft 's dominant operating system . " " in the complaint by ecis , microsoft is alleged to have illegally refused to disclose interoperability information across a broad range of products , including information related to its office suite , a number of its server products , and also in relation to the so-called .net framework , " the commission statement continued . " the commission 's examination will therefore focus on all these areas , including the question whether microsoft 's new file format office open xml , as implemented in office , is sufficiently interoperable with competitors ' products . " no evidence so far while the probe could mean further bad news for microsoft in europe , the european commission made it clear that it did not have any evidence of wrong-doing and that it was , at this stage , just investigating the complaints . " this initiation of proceedings does not imply that the commission has proof of an infringement , " the commission said .
" it only signifies that the commission will further investigate the case as a matter of priority .
microsoft was hit by a fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- in september last year after europe 's second-highest court dismissed the company 's appeal against an eu antitrust decision , taken in 2004 .
the court of first instance upheld the commission 's conclusion that microsoft had been guilty of monopoly abuse and had taken advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . microsoft pledged in october to give third party program developers access to information that will allow them to make systems interoperable with windows .
it also said it would substantially cut the fees it charges for such data . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

it could have consequences for germany 's tradition of collective wage bargaining , says dw 's henrik böhme . german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee on sunday , jan .
13 proudly brandished a sheet of paper containing a few scribbles and two signatures - one of the head of deutsche bahn , hartmut mehdorn , and the other of manfred schell , boss of the train drivers ' union , gdl .
bildunterschrift : henrik böhme it was proof of a breakthrough after 10 months of at times tough and bitterly fought wage negotiations .
the paper was worthy of being part of the " museum of history , " tiefensee joked .
but he was n't wrong .
the wage deal really does make history - it may just have paved the way to the end of social peace in germany .
the country is home to around 40 million employees .
but only 9,000 of them are train drivers .
they have the power to paralyze rail traffic in germany and they shamelessly used it .
there are others who are in the driving seat , too - pilots , air traffic controllers , doctors .
of course it 's right that the train drivers who were underpaid until now should get more money .
but because at the same time they will work less , the message that the deal gives out is - more money , less work .
if that becomes the norm , that would spell the end of germany .
no labor union official can probably explain how the german economy will keep up with global competition with such a motto .
that explains the muted reaction from the country 's top labor boss .
the railway wage deal is a noteworthy start to the beginning of wage negotiations in 2008 said michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the main union umbrella group .
at the same time , sommer bemoaned the gdl 's approach to wage negotiations .
that 's hardly surprising .
the train drivers ' success is bound to spur other privileged groups and in the end that could spell the end for the traditional system based on umbrella labor contracts for whole industries or firms .
though it 's considered by some to be outdated , the system is an important pillar of social partnership which forms the fundament for the german economic model .
it 's also the basis for one of the most valuable goods in the country - social peace .
the future looks bleak .
large trade unions such as ig metall , which represents employees of the metal-bashing and electronics sector , and verdi , which represents more than 1,000 professions in the service sector , are fragmenting into ever smaller labor groups .
they 're wrangling with other splinter trade unions - as was the case with the train drivers ' union - and negotiating separate wage deals for each group .
that 's a recipe for strikes and could lead to ever more acrimony even within members of the same union .
in the end , only the bigger unions will benefit .
the whole labor dispute could also prove to be a tinderbox - after all , can a train driver look in the eye a conductor traveling with him and have a good conscience ?
though both work for the same company , one will now get a wage hike of 11 percent , the other only of four .
the train drivers ' union , gdl , has betrayed a key trade union principle - the principle of solidarity .
shortly before he retires , gdl boss manfred schell has erected a tombstone to one of germany 's most cherished traditions .
my recommendation for the inscription - here lays germany 's consensus-based model .

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .

the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .

the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .

hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .
but they would be engaging in public information campaigns ahead of the election , he said . poveda said spain has become one of europe 's most progressive countries in same-sex issues , with same-sex marriage continuing to have 60 percent approval . he thinks the recent attacks on gay marriage by conservative catholics will backfire because " people are sick of having that type of doctrine imposed on them .

yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .

political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 14.01.2008 spanish election showdown over abortion , gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards take to the streets with national elections looming , spain 's politicians have been sidestepping controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion .
yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .
rajoy also promised to appoint a family minister . while that 's a start , it 's not good enough , said arsuaga .
hazte oir launched a campaign to put pressure on the pp to take a stronger stand on the issue .
they 're also planning demonstrations and advertising campaigns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : same-sex marriage has very vocal supporters - and opponents antonio poveda , president of the state federation of lesbians , gays and transsexuals -lrb- felgt -rrb- , a group essential in organizing massive gay pride demonstrations in favor of same-sex marriage , said his group was n't planning any street protests .

censorship and the shutting down of newspapers have become a thing of the past and a 1999 press law was a great milestone for the young democracy .
however , the increasing influence of media moguls are posing new challenges . the figures are worrying .
last year , attacks on journalists rose from 53 in 2006 to 75 .
that 's the result heru hendratmoko , the president of aji , the alliance of independent journalists , recently presented in indonesia 's capital jakarta .
the alliance monitors the indonesian media - physical attacks , threats and legal complaints against journalists are on the up .
many journalists are worried about growing legal uncertainty .
in 1999 , the information ministry , which had exercised a strict control of the media , was shut down and a national press law was introduced to protect media freedom .
however , heru hendratmoko says this is being used less and less and that when there are cases involving journalists , " the judge , prosecutors and police always use criminal code articles .
that 's why there are still many journalists facing the courts after writing on certain issues such as corruption . "
" that 's why we 're complaining to the police , to the prosecutors , to the judges , that they should use the press law instead of the criminal code , but these complaints have been falling on deaf ears .
hendratmoko fears the government wants to roll back press freedom because at the moment it has no authority to interfere with the media .
jailed in yogjakarta the most recent example of the criminal code being used against journalists is the case of the chief editor of the newspaper " radar yogya " in the central javanese city of yogjakarta .
" one of our journalists in yogjakarta was accused of defamation for writing about a local businessman who also owned the local newspaper , " explained eko maryadi , the indonesia correspondent for reporters without borders .
" apparently , the guy is also the second king of jogjakarta - he was unhappy about the reporting of the media and made a lawsuit against our colleague , who now has to serve six months in prison because of the supreme court 's decision . "
media tycoons media tycoons control large sectors of the market as well as the content - they do not value investigative journalism .
bambang harymurti found this out for himself .
the chief editor of tempo , the country 's most important news magazine , was sued a few years ago for his reporting on the dubious business practices of tommy winata , a businessman and media tsar .
harymurti was even handed a jail sentence but this was never enforced .
he continued to publish reports criticising corruption and nepotism but he is sceptical about current developments .
" i 'm worried that media are interested in doing really investigative -lsb- journalism -rsb- .
one : because of the risk and two : because of the ownership of the media , especially in the electronic media , which are owned by just a few business people with their own interests .
although they are the ones who have the resources to carry out investigative journalism . "
heru hendratmoko from the alliance of independent journalists the problem is exacerbated by a lack of professionalism among indonesian journalists and the fact that they are incredibly underpaid .
although some media outlets are doing their best to do quality reporting , he says there needs to be a code of ethics , more money and more legal protection if the overall quality of content in the indonesian media is to improve . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic journalists want the press freedom law to be implemented more 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 14.01.2008 microsoft target of new eu antitrust probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's internet browser is under scrutiny bill gates must have thought that paying the eu 's 497-million-euro fine for monopoly abuse in september was an expensive end to an embarrassing affair .
but the eu has software giant microsoft firmly in its sights again . just when microsoft thought it was safe to go back into europe , the european commission opened a new antitrust probe into the us software giant , accusing bill gates ' company of unfairly obstructing the ability of rival applications to work on its operating systems . the probe was opened after the commission received two official complaints ; one from opera , a norwegian maker of a web browser which competes with microsoft 's internet explorer , and another from the european committee for interoperable systems -lrb- ecis -rrb- , an industry group which claimed microsoft did not disclose enough interoperability information for its range of products . " the -lsb- opera -rsb- complaint alleges that there is ongoing competitive harm from microsoft 's practices , in particular in view of new proprietary technologies that microsoft has allegedly introduced in its browser that would reduce compatibility with open internet standards , and therefore hinder competition , " the commission statement read . " in addition , allegations of tying of other separate software products by microsoft , including desktop search and windows live have been brought to the commission 's attention , " it added .
" the commission 's investigation will therefore focus on allegations that a range of products have been unlawfully tied to sales of microsoft 's dominant operating system . " " in the complaint by ecis , microsoft is alleged to have illegally refused to disclose interoperability information across a broad range of products , including information related to its office suite , a number of its server products , and also in relation to the so-called .net framework , " the commission statement continued . " the commission 's examination will therefore focus on all these areas , including the question whether microsoft 's new file format office open xml , as implemented in office , is sufficiently interoperable with competitors ' products . " no evidence so far while the probe could mean further bad news for microsoft in europe , the european commission made it clear that it did not have any evidence of wrong-doing and that it was , at this stage , just investigating the complaints . " this initiation of proceedings does not imply that the commission has proof of an infringement , " the commission said .
" it only signifies that the commission will further investigate the case as a matter of priority .
microsoft was hit by a fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- in september last year after europe 's second-highest court dismissed the company 's appeal against an eu antitrust decision , taken in 2004 .
the court of first instance upheld the commission 's conclusion that microsoft had been guilty of monopoly abuse and had taken advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . microsoft pledged in october to give third party program developers access to information that will allow them to make systems interoperable with windows .
it also said it would substantially cut the fees it charges for such data . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for many germans , it provided one last chance for a parting kiss with their beloved cigarettes as germany 's smoking ban kicked in . germany rang in the changes at the start of the year as eight of the country 's 16 states introduced a partial ban on smoking in restaurants and bars . berlin , bavaria , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony-anhalt and schleswig-holstein joined the three states already cracking down on smoking - lower saxony , baden-württemburg and hessen - in the ban . three more states , saxony , saarland and rhineland-palatinate will impose their smoking restrictions in february , with north rhine-westphalia to follow while the last bastion on smoking in germany , thuringia , will introduce its ban in july 2008 . bavaria cracks down , berlin still lights up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers face differing laws regarding their habit in different german states the latest measures follow the federal government 's ruling to ban smoking on public transport from sept .
1 , 2007 , which included taxis , buses , trains and planes anywhere in germany . the ban , which is seen by many smokers as an invasion of their personal liberty , allows states to apply their own particular variations of the law . bavaria , for instance , is cracking down the hardest with even a ban on smoking in beer tents in addition to pubs and restaurants , which will no doubt have a portion of the oktoberfest faithful loitering outside in the cold while non-smokers enjoy increased elbow room inside . in the states of saarland and saxony , small corner pubs with a regular clientele can chose whether to impose the ban , provided the owners have no employees . the self-application also stretches to the punishments .
many states , like berlin , wo n't enforce fines for breaking the rules until a few months have passed .
in the capital , those thumbing their nose at the ban will be able to do so until june .
after that they will get slapped with fines of around 100 euros -lrb- $ 147 -rrb- .
the bar owners have their own incentive to drag ban-breakers into line – they themselves will be liable for fines of up to 1,000 euros if someone lights up in their premises after enforcement comes in . in saxony , after the law is introduced in february , bar owners may face fines as high as 5,000 euros , while those in hamburg or thuringia will face a maximum of 500 euros . a challenge to the bans while germany now appears to be a paradise for non-smokers rather than the haven for smokers it has been for decades , those with a habit will still be able to puff away in smaller closed-off sections in restaurants and bars .
this has been held up by health campaign groups as evidence of the ban not going far enough as bar workers in these smokers ' rooms still face health dangers . despite this concession , germany 's restaurant industry has claimed that many businesses in the states that have already introduced the ban have suffered sharp falls in profits .
the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- says the ban has deterred people from going out for a drink or something to eat .
it claims 15 percent of those who adopted the measures in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50 percent . a group of bar owners are even collecting funds to mount a legal challenge against the bans before germany 's federal constitutional court , alleging a breach of basic rights . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " stavros dimas told the bbc on monday , jan .
14 . it would be better to miss the target than achieve it by harming the poor or damaging the environment , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has admitted there are problems with the eu 's biofuels policy in march last year , eu leaders agreed that 10 percent of the bloc 's road fuels should come from biofuels by 2020 as part of wider efforts to combat climate change and slash co2 emissions .
that goal was to be anchored in concrete legislation . too many negative consequences ? but criticism has grown steadily in past months about the negative impact of large-scale production of biofuels . critics have warned that expanding the growth of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to environmental damage , drive up food prices and lead companies to drive poor people off their land to convert it to fuel crops . last week , a group of 17 non-governmental organizations sent a letter to eu energy commissioner andreas piebalgs urging him to introduce tougher standards for biofuel production or to give up the planned biofuel targets . they argued that the eu 's draft legislation does not provide protection for important ecosystems , such as savannas or permanent grasslands " that may be threatened by expanding agriculture to meet the eu 's biofuel target . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear that biofuels is leading to loss of forest cover in some countries " destruction of these carbon sinks would lead to large emissions of carbon into the atmosphere , thereby reducing or neutralizing the benefits from growing biofuels .
neither does the draft text provide any safeguards to protect water and soil resources , " the letter said . last september , the eu 's biofuel targets were sharply criticized by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , a group made up of the world 's 30 most developed countries . the paris-based oecd said that state subsidies for biofuels would distort food prices and damage natural habitats while its impacts on combating climate change may be limited . guidelines may be altered dimas has said it 's vital for the eu 's rules to prevent the loss of biodiversity , suggesting that the draft legislation could be altered . " we have to have criteria for sustainability , including social and environmental issues , because there are some benefits from biofuels , " he added . dimas said the eu would introduce a certification scheme for biofuels and vowed to clamp down on biodiesel from palm oil , which is believed to be causing widespread forest destruction in indonesia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet recent mass demonstrations and strikes show the issues are n't going away . prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has developed an image as a firebrand ready to shake up spain 's conservative catholic establishment .
his socialist party passed europe 's most progressive same-sex marriage legislation , introduced fast-track divorce and chipped away at religious education in public schools . but ahead of a fiercely-contested national election scheduled for march 9 , zapatero is trying to polish his credentials as a moderate .
his nemesis , conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- leader mariano rajoy , is doing the same . both parties are desperate to win over undecided voters .
the socialist party is leading by only a few percentage points in the polls and it 's likely that the race will remain close to the end .
the pp won in 1996 and 2000 , largely by winning over moderates .
but the socialists attracted enough swing votes to win the last elections in 2004 . going for the political middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how these spaniards will vote is anyone 's guess spain 's swing voters are set to decide the elections again this year , said political scientist pablo onate of the university of valencia .
spanish voters have a history of punishing parties that are not seen as being close enough to the center , onate said . " this is another case in which that is going to happen , " he said .
" both parties are trying to be center-orientated . " spain 's parliament was dissolved on jan .
14 .
a 15-day electioneering period starts feb .
22 , but spanish politicians are in full pre-election swing , trying to define the most important issues for the voters .
political parties will definitely spend a lot of time talking about the economy and terrorism , but social issues are where the parties most differ and will therefore play an important role in the political debate , onate said . the spanish population , while still conservative compared with northern europe , is much more liberal today than it was 10 or 15 years ago , onate said .
yet the socialists still rely on support from voters ambivalent about issues like abortion .
and the pp needs the votes of young people more accepting of gay rights . downplaying the abortion issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is reaching for the center reforming spain 's restrictive abortion laws seemed like a social issue zapatero would embrace .
indeed , in december he promised to make the issue part of this year 's electoral campaign .
he reversed his line a short time later , saying only that he wants to reassess current abortion laws . the pp would also rather not talk about abortion , said onate .
the party did nothing to restrict abortion laws during its time in office . yet both parties might find it hard to ignore the issue .
on jan .
8 abortion clinics launched a five-day strike to protest what they feel is lack of government support and harassment from officials and pro-life activists .
the issue came into the spotlight after allegations surfaced that illegal abortions were being done at clinics in barcelona . spain 's catholics assert themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic leaders have spoken out against gay marriage one hot button issue for conservative catholic voters is spain 's legalization of gay marriage in 2005 .
the spanish roman catholic church jumped into the fray , warning that the country faced a grave moral danger .
the socialists pushed through the legislation anyway . that issue continues to incense voters .
more than 150,000 people demonstrated in madrid on dec .
30 for a " christian family day " rally organized by catholic bishops .
the event was billed as a defense of traditional family values .
but it took on a political edge as the bishops denounced politics which they say threaten the family . the government is " shaking the foundations of the family with its unique and unjust laws , " cardinal antonio canizares of toledo said at the madrid rally . cardinal agustin garcia-gasco of valencia criticized " the culture of radical secularism is a deception which only leads to abortions and fast-track divorces . " the catholic church should be making its opinion known on issues such as family , said jose carlos martin de la hoz , a prominent catholic historian and theologian .
spain 's catholics should n't keep quiet in the face of secularization which they see as destroying the fundaments of family , he said . the recent demonstration was an example of catholics taking part in the dialogue about social issues , martin de la hoz added . gay marriage likely to motivate voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy does n't want to be seen as a reactionary rajoy , who has repeatedly denounced the same-sex marriage laws , is not turning out to be the strong ally conservatives had hoped for .
in an effort to make himself attractive to moderates and to show his political independence from the catholic church , rajoy promised last week that the pp wo n't repeal socialist legislation on abortion , same-sex marriage and fast-track divorce . this infuriated many conservative groups like " hazte oir " -lrb- make yourself heard -rrb- .
hazte oir 's president , ignacio arsuaga , said he sees same-sex marriage as a key issue in the upcoming election .
the pp has said it would like to see the term " marriage " dropped in favor of a civil union , but has promised to let a court make the final decision .

but the report for the welsh language board said a quick decision was needed on whether £ 600,000 of public money should back the y byd paper venture .
backers of the daily y byd -lrb- the world -rrb- told the review that it would fail without a decision on support soon .
welsh language minister rhodri glyn thomas said he would study the review .
mr thomas announced the review during at the national eisteddfod in august 2007 .
he said it would help the welsh assembly government fulfil the pledge in the coalition agreement between labour and plaid cymru to increase funding for welsh-medium print " including the establishment of a welsh-language daily newspaper " .
case studies in europe la nua , ireland flensborg avis , denmark promorski dnevnik , italy berria , spain plans for y byd were unveiled last summer .
owners dyddiol cyf said it would aim to cover welsh , uk and international news , attracting 5,000 subscribers for the launch in march .
the review looked at la nua , an irish-language daily , which is part of the belfast media group .
the newspaper has two bases , belfast and donegal .
it has money from a cross-border funding body , some £ 400,000 over two years since 2007 .
belfast media group mg bears the financial loss .
review author dr tony bianchi examined y byd 's assumption that people in wales would buy two papers , for instance the western mail or a london-based newspaper and y byd .
the review concludes , however , that there is no evidence for such an assumption and that people are actually buying fewer papers not more .
advertising y byd 's business plan is obviously sensitive but dyddiol cyf have given figures to the review .
the paper , they say , would be in the price range 70p- £ 1.20 and could sell more than 7,000 copies .
y byd needs £ 800,000 in advertising , half of that from the assembly government and wants grant aid in the first year of between £ 600,000 to a £ 1m .
there are figures on " grant per copy sold " of the weekly publications golwg and y cymro and the welsh language current affairs magazine , barn .
interestingly , the figures show y cymro and golwg sell more copies in wales than the independent .
the review supports the need for a daily welsh-language newspaper with an online outlet but dr bianchi points out that getting it wrong and seeing a new paper start up and fail would be harmful to the whole sector .
the review says that would be a disaster and must not be allowed to happen .
dr bianchi concludes : " it is generally agreed that a successful project can bring benefits to the whole sector - a compromised , half-hearted effort will cause it serious damage . "

but the report for the welsh language board said a quick decision was needed on whether £ 600,000 of public money should back the y byd paper venture .
backers of the daily y byd -lrb- the world -rrb- told the review that it would fail without a decision on support soon .
welsh language minister rhodri glyn thomas said he would study the review .
mr thomas announced the review during at the national eisteddfod in august 2007 .
he said it would help the welsh assembly government fulfil the pledge in the coalition agreement between labour and plaid cymru to increase funding for welsh-medium print " including the establishment of a welsh-language daily newspaper " .
case studies in europe la nua , ireland flensborg avis , denmark promorski dnevnik , italy berria , spain plans for y byd were unveiled last summer .
owners dyddiol cyf said it would aim to cover welsh , uk and international news , attracting 5,000 subscribers for the launch in march .
the review looked at la nua , an irish-language daily , which is part of the belfast media group .
the newspaper has two bases , belfast and donegal .
it has money from a cross-border funding body , some £ 400,000 over two years since 2007 .
belfast media group mg bears the financial loss .
review author dr tony bianchi examined y byd 's assumption that people in wales would buy two papers , for instance the western mail or a london-based newspaper and y byd .
the review concludes , however , that there is no evidence for such an assumption and that people are actually buying fewer papers not more .
advertising y byd 's business plan is obviously sensitive but dyddiol cyf have given figures to the review .
the paper , they say , would be in the price range 70p- £ 1.20 and could sell more than 7,000 copies .
y byd needs £ 800,000 in advertising , half of that from the assembly government and wants grant aid in the first year of between £ 600,000 to a £ 1m .
there are figures on " grant per copy sold " of the weekly publications golwg and y cymro and the welsh language current affairs magazine , barn .
interestingly , the figures show y cymro and golwg sell more copies in wales than the independent .
the review supports the need for a daily welsh-language newspaper with an online outlet but dr bianchi points out that getting it wrong and seeing a new paper start up and fail would be harmful to the whole sector .
the review says that would be a disaster and must not be allowed to happen .
dr bianchi concludes : " it is generally agreed that a successful project can bring benefits to the whole sector - a compromised , half-hearted effort will cause it serious damage . "
culture and welsh language minister rhodri glyn thomas called it an " interesting and thorough review " and said he would study it carefully before deciding on the next steps .

the retailer said sales in the six weeks to 6 january had climbed by 2.5 % on the same period a year ago .
however , jjb said price cuts had hit margins , and it now expected profits for the second half of 2008 to be below 2007 's figure of £ 27.4m.
it also added that it was cautious about the outlook for 2008 .
the fall in profits was largely due to an " aggressive " clearance of " non-current " products , it said , " and only partly from the economic landscape " .
" jjb is determined to start its new financial year form february 2008 with a much fresher stock package on which stronger margins can be achieved , " it added .
jjb said that same-store sales for the 23 weeks to 6 january were up 1.9 % , and when its health clubs were included the figure rose to 2.2 % .

instead , the winners were announced on sunday night at a news conference in beverly hills .
minus all the usual glitz and glamour , the event could hardly even be described as a show .
american tv presenters were on hand to read the list of winners in 25 categories , but the nominees were not be present and tv viewers were unlikely to tune-in in large numbers .
the cancellation of hollywood 's second biggest night came after the writers ' union said it would picket the golden globes ceremony .
hollywood standstill the hollywood foreign press association reluctantly scaled back its plans when it became clear that the show could not go on . "
like everybody else i was looking forward to standing in the presence of hollywood royalty " actor jason isaacs , nominated for best actor with many hollywood studios at a standstill as a result of the strike , this year 's nominated actors found little to celebrate .
a number of the british nominees attended the annual bafta la tea party that traditionally takes place on the eve of the globes in beverly hills .
" it 's like it 's a ghost town , " said anna friel , a nominee for pushing daises in the tv category at the globes .
" it feels as if there 's a funeral , " she added .
" in some ways it 's a victory for the writers guild and the actors , " said jason isaacs , who was nominated for best actor in the state within .
free publicity " it 's a night of advertising essentially and it 's dressed up by watching your favourite stars in their glad rags .
" like everybody else i was looking forward to standing in the presence of hollywood royalty , " he added .
in hollywood , the awards season is seen as an opportunity for the studios to promote their wares .
the golden globes , coming in the run-up to the announcement of the oscar nominations , serves as a shop front for some of the year 's little-seen but critically acclaimed films .
" the real reason we 're here is partly to watch the news conference , but it 's also partly to help push the film , " said james mcavoy , who was nominated for his role in the epic tragic romance atonement .
" all these films that are nominated are all opening more widely , and going out to parts of america that might not necessarily go and see an art-house film otherwise , " he added .
the actor was hoping to make up for the lost publicity opportunity .
" in the absence of a night in the sun , or a night in the moonlight , like an awards ceremony is , where you get all this free publicity , and middle america goes ' i 'll go and see this film that i would n't have seen before ' we have to do more talking and pushing in the press , " he said .
atonement eventually won best film and best score - but mcavoy and his co-star keira knightley lost out on lead actor awards .
director ridley scott , nominated for the crime story american gangster , said the strike was " a pity " , adding : " it would be this year , would n't it ? "
" i think it will probably be settled soon .
i hope . "

instead , the winners were announced on sunday night at a news conference in beverly hills .
minus all the usual glitz and glamour , the event could hardly even be described as a show .
american tv presenters were on hand to read the list of winners in 25 categories , but the nominees were not be present and tv viewers were unlikely to tune-in in large numbers .
the cancellation of hollywood 's second biggest night came after the writers ' union said it would picket the golden globes ceremony .

like everybody else i was looking forward to standing in the presence of hollywood royalty actor jason isaacs , nominated for best actor with many hollywood studios at a standstill as a result of the strike , this year 's nominated actors found little to celebrate .
a number of the british nominees attended the annual bafta la tea party that traditionally takes place on the eve of the globes in beverly hills .
" it 's like it 's a ghost town , " said anna friel , a nominee for pushing daises in the tv category at the globes .
" it feels as if there 's a funeral , " she added .
" in some ways it 's a victory for the writers guild and the actors , " said jason isaacs , who was nominated for best actor in the state within .

james mcavoy is nominated for his role in atonement " the real reason we 're here is partly to watch the news conference , but it 's also partly to help push the film , " said james mcavoy , who was nominated for his role in the epic tragic romance atonement .
" all these films that are nominated are all opening more widely , and going out to parts of america that might not necessarily go and see an art-house film otherwise , " he added .
the actor was hoping to make up for the lost publicity opportunity .
" in the absence of a night in the sun , or a night in the moonlight , like an awards ceremony is , where you get all this free publicity , and middle america goes ' i 'll go and see this film that i would n't have seen before ' we have to do more talking and pushing in the press , " he said .
atonement eventually won best film and best score - but mcavoy and his co-star keira knightley lost out on lead actor awards .
director ridley scott , nominated for the crime story american gangster , said the strike was " a pity " , adding : " it would be this year , would n't it ? "
" i think it will probably be settled soon .

the former mp and am confirmed he had accepted the nomination and said a " strong voice " for wales was needed .
the move follows the party 's historic vote in november in favour of sending representatives to the second chamber .
plaid had rejected the policy of creating its own peers because it wanted the lords to be fully elected .
at plaid 's conference in september representatives agreed to review the policy after plaid parliamentary leader elfyn llwyd argued that peers were required to ensure planned legislation for wales was not blocked at westminster .
the members would also be required to reflect the views of the people of wales in the upper chamber , he said .
dafydd wigley fact file born : derby , 1 april 1943 educated : manchester university ; industrial economist married : elinor bennett elected : caernarfon mp 1974-2001 and am 1999-2003 sponsored : disabled persons act of 1981 plaid cymru : president 1981 - 4 and 1991 - 2000 mr wigley had stipulated in october thee conditions before he would consider a move to the house of lords .
these included the establishment of good links between plaid 's three mps , its ams and the new members of the second chamber .
mr wigley , the former caernarfon mp and am , said he thought it was important to have as strong a voice as possible in the house of lords .
" decisions are taken there that have a direct material affect on the well being of wales , " he said .
" they can block legislative proposals from the national assembly therefore we want as strong a voice for wales as possible there . "
the welsh assembly 's new powers under the government of wales act allows it to make its own laws in devolved areas , with the permission of parliament .
but mr llwyd has warned that many in the house of lords might want to block such permission , known as orders in council .
an election will take place in plaid 's national council on 26 january to decide on the slate of nominees which the party will put forward for membership of the second chamber .

the panel was set up by health secretary nicola sturgeon after she reversed decisions to close the a & es .
the scrutiny panel reports said the ayrshire and lanarkshire health boards failed to back up their plans with evidence or reliable figures .
the two health boards said they would consider the panel 's findings .

health bosses are accused of using selective quotations in making their case for change .
nhs lanarkshire is said to have used out-of-date evidence .
a statement issued by nhs lanarkshire said : " we have always recognised that this is a very complex review and which both the board and the independent scrutiny panel have completed in a very condensed timeframe .
" the isp report will be fully considered by the board along with a comprehensive suite of information prior to making a decision on a preferred option for retaining a & e services at monklands hospital when it meets at the end of january .
" once the board has reached a conclusion , this will be passed to the cabinet secretary for her consideration . "

" in reaching a conclusion and then making a recommendation for the cabinet secretary 's consideration , the nhs board will ensure that accident and emergency services will be provided at both ayr and crosshouse hospitals . "
plans to downgrade the a & e departments to minor injury units were approved by the last scottish labour administration in 2006 .
but when the snp took over last may it told health boards to draw up new proposals and created a panel to scrutinise them .
both boards submitted proposals which were said to support schemes which still would cut emergency care .

she told bbc good morning scotland : " any service that is not clinically safe will not operate in scotland , that is an absolute given .
" the a & e services at monklands and ayr are clinically safe , the question is whether the boards in ayrshire and lanarkshire made a convincing case to change those services and indeed remove them altogether .
" the report today says that case was not made .
it is now for the boards in question to reflect on the comments made in this report and reflect on revised proposals . "
labour health spokeswoman margaret curran said : " what we have seen is that the consultation was flawed and i think that should be looked at .
" it is a very , very serious criticism and health boards should listen to that very strongly , but that is not a substitute for making sure you address issues of clinical safety .
" nicola sturgeon has been challenged on that before .
i suspect she will be challenged on that again . "

the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- believes the overdraft charges levied by banks and building societies are unfair and wants the high court to rule accordingly .
however , the banks insist their fees are legal .
what exactly is the high court being asked to decide ?
the oft is challenging seven leading banks and the nationwide building society about the fairness of their unauthorised overdraft charges .
customers are sometimes charged more than £ 30 for going into the red without permission , an amount which the oft and consumer groups argue is significantly higher than the true administrative cost .
however , the oft will not ask the judge to make a straightforward ruling that the banks ' charges are unfair .
bank refunds in 2007 barclays - £ 87m hsbc - £ 116m hbos - £ 79m lloyds tsb - £ 36m rbs - £ 81m source : bank interim results instead it will argue that the overdraft charges come under the scope of the 1999 unfair terms in consumer contracts regulations .
this would mean the oft would have the authority to decide itself if the charges are unfair , and the power to force the banks to change their practices as a result .
the regulator will also argue that the banks ' terms and conditions are not written in sufficiently plain english , something else that would give the oft jurisdiction to act .
for their part , the banks argue that their charges are a fee for a service and not a penalty charge , and also that they form a core term of their contracts with their customers .
as such they say the unfair terms legislation does not apply .
why has the case reached the high court ?
the test case was announced last summer , in response to an unprecedented wave of mass litigation which has swept the country during the past two years .
it is estimated that banks have so far refunded about £ 570m to 330,000 customers who accused them , often through local court proceedings , of imposing excessive overdraft fees that were unfair and illegal .
in the vast majority of cases the banks chose to settle the cases before the matter reached court .
this has meant no legal precedent was been set .
but the growing volume of cases led to an agreement between the banks and the oft to seek a high court ruling to ensure what the regulator called a " clear and orderly resolution " of the issue .
what is at stake ?
potentially billions of pounds and the future of free current account banking .
if the oft argument is upheld it could mean banks and building societies having to return billions in fees collected from customers over the past six years .
in addition , some senior banking industry figures have suggested that the loss of income from charges - which the oft estimated to be worth about £ 10m a day - could lead to introduction of monthly current account charges .
most uk bank customers enjoy free banking while in credit , whereas in many other countries current account fees are commonplace .
is the end in sight ?
not really .
the high court hearing is expected to last eight days with a judgement being delivered by the court around easter .
but whichever side loses is highly likely to appeal , possibly all the way to the house of lords , which means the issue may not be resolved until next year .
and even if the oft was ultimately successful , it would not automatically lead to payouts for customers .
it is expected that the question of compensation would be dealt with by the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- and the financial ombudsman service -lrb- fos -rrb- .
can people still complain about bank charges ?
yes .
consumer groups are urging customers who are unhappy about their charges to continue to make a claim against their bank .
however , banks will not process complaints at this stage because they are still covered by a " waiver " granted to them by the fsa in july when the test case was announced .
this says they do not have to make progress with any new or unresolved complaints about their charges until the outcome of the court case .
in addition , since the test case announcement , most courts have also been halting new and existing claims for the return of overdraft charges until the legal issues are settled .
some estimates suggest as many a million cases have been left in limbo .
but campaigners argue it is still worth reporting new claims as banks must acknowledge them .
this means customers ' details would already be on the banks ' systems should they lose the legal action and be told to pay compensation .

however , banks will not process complaints at this stage because they are still covered by a " waiver " granted to them by the fsa in july when the test case was announced .
this says they do not have to make progress with any new or unresolved complaints about their charges until the outcome of the court case .
in addition , since the test case announcement , most courts have also been halting new and existing claims for the return of overdraft charges until the legal issues are settled .
some estimates suggest as many a million cases have been left in limbo .
but campaigners argue it is still worth reporting new claims as banks must acknowledge them .
this means customers ' details would already be on the banks ' systems should they lose the legal action and be told to pay compensation .
