instead , only a tunnel could spare its unesco title . if dresden builds a bridge across the elbe river , its world heritage title will be revoked , said unesco .
all of the structures the city has proposed to ease traffic would disrupt the view of dresden 's most significant landmarks : the church of our lady , the city 's cathedral and the semper opera . " a tunnel would mean a much smaller encroachment , " a unesco spokesman told the thursday , march 6 , edition of the sächsische zeitung .
" none of the alternative bridges can preserve the landscape . " on wednesday , a four-person committee - made up of german federal and state politicians as well as a university professor - met in paris with the director of unesco 's world heritage center , francesco bandarin , to discuss the situation . dresden had presented a new draft of a less bulky bridge in january and unesco representatives traveled to the saxon capital last month to inspect the scene . support for tunnel grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most recent bridge plan was meant to harmonize with the surroundings " now we have clarity , " state politician martin dulig told news agency dpa after wednesday 's meeting , referring to the un body 's rejection of all of the bridge drafts .
" the question of what to do now has to be resolved in dresden - and fast . " dresden 's city council will meet on march 13 to decide whether to proceed with a bridge in spite of the unesco decision - construction on a bridge has been underway since november - or to build a tunnel beneath the elbe river .
the project was initiated as a way to alleviate traffic into the city . some 40,000 signatures have been collected in dresden as part of a petition supporting a tunnel .
demonstrations against the bridge are planned for this saturday . currently , 32 of unesco 's 851 world cultural heritage sites are located in germany .
due to the bridge project , dresden has been on the list of endangered sites since 2006 .

the judge , who appeared to have a hard time keeping a straight face at the couple 's predicament , agreed to withhold the fine , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2008 europe warily eyes window of opportunity in cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro may no longer be president but his influence over cuba remains strong louis michel , the european commissioner for development and aid , leads an eu delegation to cuba on thursday , feb .
6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karl and theo albrecht , founders of aldi supermarkets , made their extreme fortunes selling low-price groceries . in germany , everyone knows the aldi supermarket chain .
less well-known are the reclusive brothers karl and theo albrecht , the chain 's founders . while the brothers stay well out of the public eye , their astounding transformation from small-time shopkeepers in germany 's ruhr valley to worldwide discount kings is the stuff of legend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi shopping carts stand ready karl had an estimated fortune of $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- , according to forbes magazine 's 2008 list of the world 's richest people , making him the wealthiest man in germany .
his younger brother theo was " only " valued at $ 23 billion , which made him the world 's 16th richest person - six spots behind his big brother karl . legendary investor warren buffett , the chairman of berkshire hathway , has knocked microsoft founder bill gates off the top of the list the magazine reported on thursday , march 6 .
buffett 's fortune was listed at $ 62 billion , while gates ' $ 58 billion was enough for third place on the list behind mexico 's carlos slim 's $ 60 billion . no silver spoons in sight karl was born into difficult circumstances in 1920 , his brother theo two years later .
their father was an out-of-work miner affected with black lung disease , who worked as a hired hand in a bread factory .
their mother ran a small grocery store in a working class neighborhood . both sons apprenticed in food retail , theo at his mother 's shop and karl in a well-known gourmet store .
their studies were interrupted by world war ii , which saw theo go to africa and karl to the eastern front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renowned logo after the war , the 1948 currency reform - which wiped out the black market virtually overnight and allowed shops to stock a variety of legal foodstuffs - gave the pair their first shot at a foothold in the market .
they founded their own grocery store , based on a novel idea : offering a small array of goods with reduced services , at everyday low prices . successful strategy within 10 years they had 300 branches and sales of over 100 million deutsche marks .
the first store to be called aldi -lrb- a composite of albrecht and discount -rrb- opened in dortmund in 1962 .
around the same time , the brothers decided to divvy up their empire , with karl taking over the stores is southern germany -lrb- aldi-süd -rrb- and theo in charge of the northern stores -lrb- aldi-nord -rrb- .
they continued to work together closely , however .
the fortune remains family held , kept in a complex web of private trusts and holding companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stocking up on cheap stuff aldi built its success on a formula : the product assortment is kept to a minimum -lrb- around 700 products compared with around 25,000 in regular supermarkets , -rrb- and goods only come into the inventory if assured a minimum sales value , and volume .
the stores have small staffs and save money on expenses like decor , advertising , and even shelf-stocking - wares are sold directly from loading pallets .
savings are passed on to customers . reclusive lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare photo of theo albrecht was taken after a 17-day kidnapping ordeal aldi long ago expanded to non-food items like textiles and hardware .
it is now germany 's number one computer seller , with 60 percent of that market .
the wild success of aldi at home led to expansion overseas , and today aldi stores can be found around the globe .
in the united states , it owns the popular supermarket chain trader joe 's . despite their outlandish business success , the brothers have managed to keep their private lives almost entirely under wraps , howard hughes-style .
any chance of their opening up to the public was definitively quashed after theo survived a kidnapping attempt in 1971 ; he was freed from 17 days in captivity after paying a 7 million mark ransom . but word does occasionally leak out about them .
karl retired in the 1980s , leaving the company in the hands of non-family members .

a judge said they can take their time . david laurin raphael julian does n't cut it for a munich mom .
something seems to be missing .
her husband strongly disagrees , believing the four first names perfectly sum up their 14-month-old bundle of joy .
no fifth name is necessary , the boy 's father told a judge in the southern city of munich .
" my wife would like to add one more biblical name .
but i find david laurin raphael julian biblical enough , " the father said .
munich city authorities began getting impatient after the boy 's one year birthday .
they slapped the parents with a monthly 50 euro -lrb- 75 dollar -rrb- fine to try and speed the naming process along .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most kids just go with the flow but the parents are refusing to be pressured .
the mother is a lawyer and the father a judicial civil servant , so they naturally took the case to court , arguing that the fine was intended to compel parents who had already agreed on a name to register it with the proper authorities .
but they were n't to that point yet .
the judge , who appeared to have a hard time keeping a straight face at the couple 's predicament , agreed to withhold the fine , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the father expressed optimism he and his wife would reach agreement before their son attended kindergarten , but would not commit himself to a precise date .
" i 'm not a prophet , " he said .
hopefully the fifth name they 're fighting over is n't " divorce . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a judge said they can take their time . david laurin raphael julian does n't cut it for a munich mom .
something seems to be missing .
her husband strongly disagrees , believing the four first names perfectly sum up their 14-month-old bundle of joy .
no fifth name is necessary , the boy 's father told a judge in the southern city of munich .
" my wife would like to add one more biblical name .
but i find david laurin raphael julian biblical enough , " the father said .
munich city authorities began getting impatient after the boy 's one year birthday .
they slapped the parents with a monthly 50 euro -lrb- 75 dollar -rrb- fine to try and speed the naming process along .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most kids just go with the flow but the parents are refusing to be pressured .
the mother is a lawyer and the father a judicial civil servant , so they naturally took the case to court , arguing that the fine was intended to compel parents who had already agreed on a name to register it with the proper authorities .

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.03.2008 chorus of protests greet pentagon 's airbus decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon snubbed boeing in its plan to revamp its refuelling air tankers the pentagon ’ s surprise decision to buy refuelling tankers for the us air force from european defense contractor eads instead of the heavily-favored boeing has set off a storm of protest in the us . the air force decision to award an airbus / northrup grumman team a $ 35 billion -lrb- 23 billion euro -rrb- contract over us rival boeing is still sending off ripples in the us political establishment .
the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama were upset by the news boeing seeks clarification shearon quantified the number of us jobs endangered by the deal at 40,000 .
meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .

meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama were upset by the news boeing seeks clarification shearon quantified the number of us jobs endangered by the deal at 40,000 .
meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .

in the early days , the greens ' politics were marked by doomsday scenarios : fears of nuclear war and the effects unchecked capitalism on nature .
german reunification and the resulting merger of the west german greens with the east german civil activist group " alliance 90 " were historical turning points that shifted the party towards consolidation into a " real " party . coming of age controversial issues during the greens first legislative period , such as pacifism or the ability to govern , lost their explosiveness over time .
concurrently , political realists within the party , called " realos , " gradually gained the upper hand in opposition to environmental socialists , called " fundis , " an abbreviation for fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- r . -rrb- and fischer -lrb- middle -rrb- the greens ' early years in the bundestag are now viewed as their adolescence .
by 1988 at the latest , when joschka fischer joined social democrat gerhard schröder 's cabinet as foreign minister , the party had become a fixture in germany 's party system . now the left party , a new alliance comprised mainly of ex-communists and disaffected former social democrats , faces similar resistance to what the greens experienced in the early 1980s .
rejected by the cdu / csu and the fdp as a band of reactionary communists , the left is viewed as a threat to the center-left spd .
but with 53 seats in the 612-member strong bundestag and representation in 10 of germany 's 16 state parliaments , they 're the new political force that can no longer be ignored . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .
nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer underscored that the alliance will not overrule greece in the dispute .
" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .
“ nato works by consensus . ”
de hoop scheffer said he hopes to find a solution by the time of a nato summit planned for the romanian capital of bucharest on april 2-4 .
macedonia makes its case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia is ready to join macedonia took its public relations fight to london 's the times newspaper , where it took out a two-page advertisement listing the reasons why it would make a good nato member and insisting on its right to keep its name .
skopje has proposed using the name “ macedonia ” in all cases except with athens , where it has offered to use a name acceptable to both parties .
so far , greece has n't agreed , although a nato envoy is currently trying to broker a deal .
" we would hope that greece and macedonia will be able to accept a way forward , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after the meeting .
unclear map for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about georgia 's commitment to democracy but it was n't only macedonia 's membership that hit a snag . the former soviet countries of georgia and ukraine had hoped to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- similar to what the balkan countries had gone through .
map prepares a country for eventual entry into nato .
but it was unclear whether they had the enough support to begin the map process .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he remained “ skeptical ” about both countries ' chances .
in ukraine , public opinion polls show many people strongly oppose joining nato .
and nato members were alarmed by georgia 's decision to declare a state of emergency in december 2007 to put an end to opposition protests .
the “ russia factor ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has opposed nato expansion besides democracy worries , there was also concern that allowing georgia and ukraine into the nato club would anger russia .
while russia ca n't block nato membership , there 's a sense that the move would further aggravate an already-strained relationship .
russia has deeply opposed both kosovo 's independence and united states missile shield plans .
“ we have a new president in russia and i think the european union wants to put its ties with russia on another footing , ” said luxembourg 's jean asselborn .
“ we have to take the interests of others , not only of nato members , into account . ”
even the us , which has backed both countries ' accession bids , seemed reluctant to push the issue thursday .
at the end of the meeting officials said only that " a broad spectrum of views " had come up in relation to the two countries .
a plan for afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is sceptical of georgia and ukraine 's chances while nato seemed stalled on expansion plans , it did agree on a comprehensive afghan strategy thursday .
the plan combines desires by some allies for more help in fighting the taliban with demands from other allies that attention be paid to reconstruction and nation building .
us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have done the brunt of the fighting against the taliban in afghanistan 's south while allies like germany , france and italy have been reluctant to send troops there .
secretary of state rice , who had criticized nato allies ' reluctance to join the fighting , sounded a conciliatory note thursday .
" germany , like others , is contributing to the efforts and that is greatly appreciated , " rice said .
however , she stressed that defeating terrorism and the taliban remain a priority .
reconstruction , governance and rule of law is not enough , rice said .

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .
nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer underscored that the alliance will not overrule greece in the dispute .
" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .
“ nato works by consensus . ”
de hoop scheffer said he hopes to find a solution by the time of a nato summit planned for the romanian capital of bucharest on april 2-4 .
macedonia makes its case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia is ready to join macedonia took its public relations fight to london 's the times newspaper , where it took out a two-page advertisement listing the reasons why it would make a good nato member and insisting on its right to keep its name .
skopje has proposed using the name “ macedonia ” in all cases except with athens , where it has offered to use a name acceptable to both parties .
so far , greece has n't agreed , although a nato envoy is currently trying to broker a deal .
" we would hope that greece and macedonia will be able to accept a way forward , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after the meeting .
unclear map for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about georgia 's commitment to democracy but it was n't only macedonia 's membership that hit a snag . the former soviet countries of georgia and ukraine had hoped to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- similar to what the balkan countries had gone through .
map prepares a country for eventual entry into nato .
but it was unclear whether they had the enough support to begin the map process .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he remained “ skeptical ” about both countries ' chances .
in ukraine , public opinion polls show many people strongly oppose joining nato .
and nato members were alarmed by georgia 's decision to declare a state of emergency in december 2007 to put an end to opposition protests .
the “ russia factor ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has opposed nato expansion besides democracy worries , there was also concern that allowing georgia and ukraine into the nato club would anger russia .
while russia ca n't block nato membership , there 's a sense that the move would further aggravate an already-strained relationship .
russia has deeply opposed both kosovo 's independence and united states missile shield plans .
“ we have a new president in russia and i think the european union wants to put its ties with russia on another footing , ” said luxembourg 's jean asselborn .
“ we have to take the interests of others , not only of nato members , into account . ”
even the us , which has backed both countries ' accession bids , seemed reluctant to push the issue thursday .
at the end of the meeting officials said only that " a broad spectrum of views " had come up in relation to the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.03.2008 25 years after greens upset german politics , left does the same großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the early days , the greens were a protest party the green party entered germany 's parliament a quarter of a century ago , fundamentally changing the country 's party landscape .
this year 's anniversary comes as the left party is on its way to doing the very same thing . twenty-eight green parliamentarians took their place in the bundestag on march 6 , 1983 , heralding in a new era for the environmentalist party at the federal level and the birth of a four-party system in west germany .
the conservative cdu / csu sneered as the newly elected parliamentarians , in long beards , overalls and woolly sweaters , reveled in their new roles as the people 's representatives . as in the case of the left party today , the greens had been dubbed a protest party and political actors debated fiercely whether the established parties dared forge alliances with them .
but they had won 5.6 percent in federal elections and could no longer be discounted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens ' presence in the bundestag signified a cultural revolution the party had been born only three years previously out of a number of protest movements , drawing support not only from young voters , but from a broad swath of society . the three-party system of the conservative cdu / csu , the unionist social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- became a four-party system .
in the early days , the greens ' politics were marked by doomsday scenarios : fears of nuclear war and the effects unchecked capitalism on nature .
german reunification and the resulting merger of the west german greens with the east german civil activist group " alliance 90 " were historical turning points that shifted the party towards consolidation into a " real " party . coming of age controversial issues during the greens first legislative period , such as pacifism or the ability to govern , lost their explosiveness over time .
concurrently , political realists within the party , called " realos , " gradually gained the upper hand in opposition to environmental socialists , called " fundis , " an abbreviation for fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- r . -rrb- and fischer -lrb- middle -rrb- the greens ' early years in the bundestag are now viewed as their adolescence .
by 1988 at the latest , when joschka fischer joined social democrat gerhard schröder 's cabinet as foreign minister , the party had become a fixture in germany 's party system . now the left party , a new alliance comprised mainly of ex-communists and disaffected former social democrats , faces similar resistance to what the greens experienced in the early 1980s .
rejected by the cdu / csu and the fdp as a band of reactionary communists , the left is viewed as a threat to the center-left spd .
but with 53 seats in the 612-member strong bundestag and representation in 10 of germany 's 16 state parliaments , they 're the new political force that can no longer be ignored . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .

that was thanks to a star performance from young keeper manuel neuer . schalke 's 21-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer saved two spot kicks in extra time to help his team clinch a spot in the champions league quarterfinals . the penalty shoot-out became necessary after porto beat schalke at home 1-nil , bringing the fixture to a 1-all on aggregate . bringing a 1-nil adavntage into the match , schalke looked to be home free as neither team created many chances , and porto went a man down .
but the hosts ' argentinean striker lisandro lopez scored four minutes from time . in the two additional fifteen-minute periods , neither team could break the deadlock - setting up neuer 's finest moment as a professional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer stole the show " it was a super performance from manuel neuer , and not only in the penalty shootout , " schalke coach mirko slomka told premiere tv after the match .

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2008 europe warily eyes window of opportunity in cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro may no longer be president but his influence over cuba remains strong louis michel , the european commissioner for development and aid , leads an eu delegation to cuba on thursday , feb .
6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama were upset by the news boeing seeks clarification shearon quantified the number of us jobs endangered by the deal at 40,000 .
meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .
if the democrats win the presidential election , that scenario would be even more likely , cote said .
" but i think the worst-case scenario for airbus is that the decision will be put off , maybe by a year .
but it probably wo n't be overturned . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama were upset by the news boeing seeks clarification shearon quantified the number of us jobs endangered by the deal at 40,000 .
meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .
if the democrats win the presidential election , that scenario would be even more likely , cote said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2008 europe warily eyes window of opportunity in cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro may no longer be president but his influence over cuba remains strong louis michel , the european commissioner for development and aid , leads an eu delegation to cuba on thursday , feb .
6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .
nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer underscored that the alliance will not overrule greece in the dispute .
" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .
“ nato works by consensus . ”
de hoop scheffer said he hopes to find a solution by the time of a nato summit planned for the romanian capital of bucharest on april 2-4 .
macedonia makes its case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia is ready to join macedonia took its public relations fight to london 's the times newspaper , where it took out a two-page advertisement listing the reasons why it would make a good nato member and insisting on its right to keep its name .
skopje has proposed using the name “ macedonia ” in all cases except with athens , where it has offered to use a name acceptable to both parties .
so far , greece has n't agreed , although a nato envoy is currently trying to broker a deal .
" we would hope that greece and macedonia will be able to accept a way forward , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after the meeting .
unclear map for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about georgia 's commitment to democracy but it was n't only macedonia 's membership that hit a snag . the former soviet countries of georgia and ukraine had hoped to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- similar to what the balkan countries had gone through .
map prepares a country for eventual entry into nato .
but it was unclear whether they had the enough support to begin the map process .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he remained “ skeptical ” about both countries ' chances .
in ukraine , public opinion polls show many people strongly oppose joining nato .
and nato members were alarmed by georgia 's decision to declare a state of emergency in december 2007 to put an end to opposition protests .
the “ russia factor ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has opposed nato expansion besides democracy worries , there was also concern that allowing georgia and ukraine into the nato club would anger russia .
while russia ca n't block nato membership , there 's a sense that the move would further aggravate an already-strained relationship .
russia has deeply opposed both kosovo 's independence and united states missile shield plans .
“ we have a new president in russia and i think the european union wants to put its ties with russia on another footing , ” said luxembourg 's jean asselborn .
“ we have to take the interests of others , not only of nato members , into account . ”
even the us , which has backed both countries ' accession bids , seemed reluctant to push the issue thursday .
at the end of the meeting officials said only that " a broad spectrum of views " had come up in relation to the two countries .
a plan for afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is sceptical of georgia and ukraine 's chances while nato seemed stalled on expansion plans , it did agree on a comprehensive afghan strategy thursday .
the plan combines desires by some allies for more help in fighting the taliban with demands from other allies that attention be paid to reconstruction and nation building .
us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have done the brunt of the fighting against the taliban in afghanistan 's south while allies like germany , france and italy have been reluctant to send troops there .
secretary of state rice , who had criticized nato allies ' reluctance to join the fighting , sounded a conciliatory note thursday .
" germany , like others , is contributing to the efforts and that is greatly appreciated , " rice said .
however , she stressed that defeating terrorism and the taliban remain a priority .
reconstruction , governance and rule of law is not enough , rice said .
" we have to win against the insurgents , we have to help the afghans , train the army , and it is a shared view that we need more help in that regard , " she added . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a judge said they can take their time . david laurin raphael julian does n't cut it for a munich mom .
something seems to be missing .
her husband strongly disagrees , believing the four first names perfectly sum up their 14-month-old bundle of joy .
no fifth name is necessary , the boy 's father told a judge in the southern city of munich .
" my wife would like to add one more biblical name .
but i find david laurin raphael julian biblical enough , " the father said .
munich city authorities began getting impatient after the boy 's one year birthday .
they slapped the parents with a monthly 50 euro -lrb- 75 dollar -rrb- fine to try and speed the naming process along .

but they were n't to that point yet .
the judge , who appeared to have a hard time keeping a straight face at the couple 's predicament , agreed to withhold the fine , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the father expressed optimism he and his wife would reach agreement before their son attended kindergarten , but would not commit himself to a precise date .
" i 'm not a prophet , " he said .

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .
nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer underscored that the alliance will not overrule greece in the dispute .
" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .
“ nato works by consensus . ”
de hoop scheffer said he hopes to find a solution by the time of a nato summit planned for the romanian capital of bucharest on april 2-4 .
macedonia makes its case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia is ready to join macedonia took its public relations fight to london 's the times newspaper , where it took out a two-page advertisement listing the reasons why it would make a good nato member and insisting on its right to keep its name .
skopje has proposed using the name “ macedonia ” in all cases except with athens , where it has offered to use a name acceptable to both parties .
so far , greece has n't agreed , although a nato envoy is currently trying to broker a deal .
" we would hope that greece and macedonia will be able to accept a way forward , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after the meeting .
unclear map for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about georgia 's commitment to democracy but it was n't only macedonia 's membership that hit a snag . the former soviet countries of georgia and ukraine had hoped to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- similar to what the balkan countries had gone through .
map prepares a country for eventual entry into nato .
but it was unclear whether they had the enough support to begin the map process .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he remained “ skeptical ” about both countries ' chances .
in ukraine , public opinion polls show many people strongly oppose joining nato .
and nato members were alarmed by georgia 's decision to declare a state of emergency in december 2007 to put an end to opposition protests .
the “ russia factor ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has opposed nato expansion besides democracy worries , there was also concern that allowing georgia and ukraine into the nato club would anger russia .

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .
nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer underscored that the alliance will not overrule greece in the dispute .
" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .
“ nato works by consensus . ”
de hoop scheffer said he hopes to find a solution by the time of a nato summit planned for the romanian capital of bucharest on april 2-4 .
macedonia makes its case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia is ready to join macedonia took its public relations fight to london 's the times newspaper , where it took out a two-page advertisement listing the reasons why it would make a good nato member and insisting on its right to keep its name .
skopje has proposed using the name “ macedonia ” in all cases except with athens , where it has offered to use a name acceptable to both parties .
so far , greece has n't agreed , although a nato envoy is currently trying to broker a deal .
" we would hope that greece and macedonia will be able to accept a way forward , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after the meeting .
unclear map for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about georgia 's commitment to democracy but it was n't only macedonia 's membership that hit a snag . the former soviet countries of georgia and ukraine had hoped to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- similar to what the balkan countries had gone through .
map prepares a country for eventual entry into nato .
but it was unclear whether they had the enough support to begin the map process .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he remained “ skeptical ” about both countries ' chances .
in ukraine , public opinion polls show many people strongly oppose joining nato .
and nato members were alarmed by georgia 's decision to declare a state of emergency in december 2007 to put an end to opposition protests .
the “ russia factor ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has opposed nato expansion besides democracy worries , there was also concern that allowing georgia and ukraine into the nato club would anger russia .
while russia ca n't block nato membership , there 's a sense that the move would further aggravate an already-strained relationship .
russia has deeply opposed both kosovo 's independence and united states missile shield plans .
“ we have a new president in russia and i think the european union wants to put its ties with russia on another footing , ” said luxembourg 's jean asselborn .
“ we have to take the interests of others , not only of nato members , into account . ”
even the us , which has backed both countries ' accession bids , seemed reluctant to push the issue thursday .
at the end of the meeting officials said only that " a broad spectrum of views " had come up in relation to the two countries .
a plan for afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is sceptical of georgia and ukraine 's chances while nato seemed stalled on expansion plans , it did agree on a comprehensive afghan strategy thursday .
the plan combines desires by some allies for more help in fighting the taliban with demands from other allies that attention be paid to reconstruction and nation building .
us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have done the brunt of the fighting against the taliban in afghanistan 's south while allies like germany , france and italy have been reluctant to send troops there .
secretary of state rice , who had criticized nato allies ' reluctance to join the fighting , sounded a conciliatory note thursday .
" germany , like others , is contributing to the efforts and that is greatly appreciated , " rice said .
however , she stressed that defeating terrorism and the taliban remain a priority .
reconstruction , governance and rule of law is not enough , rice said .
" we have to win against the insurgents , we have to help the afghans , train the army , and it is a shared view that we need more help in that regard , " she added . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .

' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .

meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2008 europe warily eyes window of opportunity in cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro may no longer be president but his influence over cuba remains strong louis michel , the european commissioner for development and aid , leads an eu delegation to cuba on thursday , feb .
6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy .

according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 06.03.2008 eu alters balkan course with new support package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia-herzegovina still has a long way to go , says the eu bosnia herzegovina has been under the guidance of the international community for over 12 years .
now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa .

instead , only a tunnel could spare its unesco title . if dresden builds a bridge across the elbe river , its world heritage title will be revoked , said unesco .

" a tunnel would mean a much smaller encroachment , " a unesco spokesman told the thursday , march 6 , edition of the sächsische zeitung .
" none of the alternative bridges can preserve the landscape . " on wednesday , a four-person committee - made up of german federal and state politicians as well as a university professor - met in paris with the director of unesco 's world heritage center , francesco bandarin , to discuss the situation . dresden had presented a new draft of a less bulky bridge in january and unesco representatives traveled to the saxon capital last month to inspect the scene . support for tunnel grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most recent bridge plan was meant to harmonize with the surroundings " now we have clarity , " state politician martin dulig told news agency dpa after wednesday 's meeting , referring to the un body 's rejection of all of the bridge drafts .
" the question of what to do now has to be resolved in dresden - and fast . " dresden 's city council will meet on march 13 to decide whether to proceed with a bridge in spite of the unesco decision - construction on a bridge has been underway since november - or to build a tunnel beneath the elbe river .
the project was initiated as a way to alleviate traffic into the city . some 40,000 signatures have been collected in dresden as part of a petition supporting a tunnel .
demonstrations against the bridge are planned for this saturday . currently , 32 of unesco 's 851 world cultural heritage sites are located in germany .

the decision on friday , feb .

"
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2008 europe warily eyes window of opportunity in cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro may no longer be president but his influence over cuba remains strong louis michel , the european commissioner for development and aid , leads an eu delegation to cuba on thursday , feb .
6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision on friday , feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2008 europe warily eyes window of opportunity in cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro may no longer be president but his influence over cuba remains strong louis michel , the european commissioner for development and aid , leads an eu delegation to cuba on thursday , feb .
6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , only a tunnel could spare its unesco title . if dresden builds a bridge across the elbe river , its world heritage title will be revoked , said unesco .
all of the structures the city has proposed to ease traffic would disrupt the view of dresden 's most significant landmarks : the church of our lady , the city 's cathedral and the semper opera . " a tunnel would mean a much smaller encroachment , " a unesco spokesman told the thursday , march 6 , edition of the sächsische zeitung .
" none of the alternative bridges can preserve the landscape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2008 europe warily eyes window of opportunity in cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro may no longer be president but his influence over cuba remains strong louis michel , the european commissioner for development and aid , leads an eu delegation to cuba on thursday , feb .
6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .
nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer underscored that the alliance will not overrule greece in the dispute .
" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .
“ nato works by consensus . ”
de hoop scheffer said he hopes to find a solution by the time of a nato summit planned for the romanian capital of bucharest on april 2-4 .
macedonia makes its case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia is ready to join macedonia took its public relations fight to london 's the times newspaper , where it took out a two-page advertisement listing the reasons why it would make a good nato member and insisting on its right to keep its name .
skopje has proposed using the name “ macedonia ” in all cases except with athens , where it has offered to use a name acceptable to both parties .
so far , greece has n't agreed , although a nato envoy is currently trying to broker a deal .
" we would hope that greece and macedonia will be able to accept a way forward , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after the meeting .
unclear map for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about georgia 's commitment to democracy but it was n't only macedonia 's membership that hit a snag . the former soviet countries of georgia and ukraine had hoped to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- similar to what the balkan countries had gone through .
map prepares a country for eventual entry into nato .
but it was unclear whether they had the enough support to begin the map process .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he remained “ skeptical ” about both countries ' chances .
in ukraine , public opinion polls show many people strongly oppose joining nato .
and nato members were alarmed by georgia 's decision to declare a state of emergency in december 2007 to put an end to opposition protests .
the “ russia factor ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has opposed nato expansion besides democracy worries , there was also concern that allowing georgia and ukraine into the nato club would anger russia .
while russia ca n't block nato membership , there 's a sense that the move would further aggravate an already-strained relationship .
russia has deeply opposed both kosovo 's independence and united states missile shield plans .
“ we have a new president in russia and i think the european union wants to put its ties with russia on another footing , ” said luxembourg 's jean asselborn .
“ we have to take the interests of others , not only of nato members , into account . ”
even the us , which has backed both countries ' accession bids , seemed reluctant to push the issue thursday .
at the end of the meeting officials said only that " a broad spectrum of views " had come up in relation to the two countries .
a plan for afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is sceptical of georgia and ukraine 's chances while nato seemed stalled on expansion plans , it did agree on a comprehensive afghan strategy thursday .
the plan combines desires by some allies for more help in fighting the taliban with demands from other allies that attention be paid to reconstruction and nation building .
us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have done the brunt of the fighting against the taliban in afghanistan 's south while allies like germany , france and italy have been reluctant to send troops there .
secretary of state rice , who had criticized nato allies ' reluctance to join the fighting , sounded a conciliatory note thursday .
" germany , like others , is contributing to the efforts and that is greatly appreciated , " rice said .
however , she stressed that defeating terrorism and the taliban remain a priority .
reconstruction , governance and rule of law is not enough , rice said .
" we have to win against the insurgents , we have to help the afghans , train the army , and it is a shared view that we need more help in that regard , " she added . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , only a tunnel could spare its unesco title . if dresden builds a bridge across the elbe river , its world heritage title will be revoked , said unesco .
all of the structures the city has proposed to ease traffic would disrupt the view of dresden 's most significant landmarks : the church of our lady , the city 's cathedral and the semper opera . " a tunnel would mean a much smaller encroachment , " a unesco spokesman told the thursday , march 6 , edition of the sächsische zeitung .
" none of the alternative bridges can preserve the landscape . " on wednesday , a four-person committee - made up of german federal and state politicians as well as a university professor - met in paris with the director of unesco 's world heritage center , francesco bandarin , to discuss the situation . dresden had presented a new draft of a less bulky bridge in january and unesco representatives traveled to the saxon capital last month to inspect the scene . support for tunnel grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most recent bridge plan was meant to harmonize with the surroundings " now we have clarity , " state politician martin dulig told news agency dpa after wednesday 's meeting , referring to the un body 's rejection of all of the bridge drafts .
" the question of what to do now has to be resolved in dresden - and fast . " dresden 's city council will meet on march 13 to decide whether to proceed with a bridge in spite of the unesco decision - construction on a bridge has been underway since november - or to build a tunnel beneath the elbe river .
the project was initiated as a way to alleviate traffic into the city . some 40,000 signatures have been collected in dresden as part of a petition supporting a tunnel .
demonstrations against the bridge are planned for this saturday . currently , 32 of unesco 's 851 world cultural heritage sites are located in germany .
due to the bridge project , dresden has been on the list of endangered sites since 2006 .

this year 's anniversary comes as the left party is on its way to doing the very same thing . twenty-eight green parliamentarians took their place in the bundestag on march 6 , 1983 , heralding in a new era for the environmentalist party at the federal level and the birth of a four-party system in west germany .
the conservative cdu / csu sneered as the newly elected parliamentarians , in long beards , overalls and woolly sweaters , reveled in their new roles as the people 's representatives . as in the case of the left party today , the greens had been dubbed a protest party and political actors debated fiercely whether the established parties dared forge alliances with them .
but they had won 5.6 percent in federal elections and could no longer be discounted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens ' presence in the bundestag signified a cultural revolution the party had been born only three years previously out of a number of protest movements , drawing support not only from young voters , but from a broad swath of society . the three-party system of the conservative cdu / csu , the unionist social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- became a four-party system .
in the early days , the greens ' politics were marked by doomsday scenarios : fears of nuclear war and the effects unchecked capitalism on nature .
german reunification and the resulting merger of the west german greens with the east german civil activist group " alliance 90 " were historical turning points that shifted the party towards consolidation into a " real " party . coming of age controversial issues during the greens first legislative period , such as pacifism or the ability to govern , lost their explosiveness over time .
concurrently , political realists within the party , called " realos , " gradually gained the upper hand in opposition to environmental socialists , called " fundis , " an abbreviation for fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- r . -rrb- and fischer -lrb- middle -rrb- the greens ' early years in the bundestag are now viewed as their adolescence .
by 1988 at the latest , when joschka fischer joined social democrat gerhard schröder 's cabinet as foreign minister , the party had become a fixture in germany 's party system . now the left party , a new alliance comprised mainly of ex-communists and disaffected former social democrats , faces similar resistance to what the greens experienced in the early 1980s .
rejected by the cdu / csu and the fdp as a band of reactionary communists , the left is viewed as a threat to the center-left spd .
but with 53 seats in the 612-member strong bundestag and representation in 10 of germany 's 16 state parliaments , they 're the new political force that can no longer be ignored . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conservative cdu / csu sneered as the newly elected parliamentarians , in long beards , overalls and woolly sweaters , reveled in their new roles as the people 's representatives . as in the case of the left party today , the greens had been dubbed a protest party and political actors debated fiercely whether the established parties dared forge alliances with them .
but they had won 5.6 percent in federal elections and could no longer be discounted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens ' presence in the bundestag signified a cultural revolution the party had been born only three years previously out of a number of protest movements , drawing support not only from young voters , but from a broad swath of society . the three-party system of the conservative cdu / csu , the unionist social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- became a four-party system .
in the early days , the greens ' politics were marked by doomsday scenarios : fears of nuclear war and the effects unchecked capitalism on nature .
german reunification and the resulting merger of the west german greens with the east german civil activist group " alliance 90 " were historical turning points that shifted the party towards consolidation into a " real " party . coming of age controversial issues during the greens first legislative period , such as pacifism or the ability to govern , lost their explosiveness over time .
concurrently , political realists within the party , called " realos , " gradually gained the upper hand in opposition to environmental socialists , called " fundis , " an abbreviation for fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- r . -rrb- and fischer -lrb- middle -rrb- the greens ' early years in the bundestag are now viewed as their adolescence .
by 1988 at the latest , when joschka fischer joined social democrat gerhard schröder 's cabinet as foreign minister , the party had become a fixture in germany 's party system . now the left party , a new alliance comprised mainly of ex-communists and disaffected former social democrats , faces similar resistance to what the greens experienced in the early 1980s .
rejected by the cdu / csu and the fdp as a band of reactionary communists , the left is viewed as a threat to the center-left spd .
but with 53 seats in the 612-member strong bundestag and representation in 10 of germany 's 16 state parliaments , they 're the new political force that can no longer be ignored . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .
nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer underscored that the alliance will not overrule greece in the dispute .
" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .
“ nato works by consensus . ”
de hoop scheffer said he hopes to find a solution by the time of a nato summit planned for the romanian capital of bucharest on april 2-4 .
macedonia makes its case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia is ready to join macedonia took its public relations fight to london 's the times newspaper , where it took out a two-page advertisement listing the reasons why it would make a good nato member and insisting on its right to keep its name .
skopje has proposed using the name “ macedonia ” in all cases except with athens , where it has offered to use a name acceptable to both parties .
so far , greece has n't agreed , although a nato envoy is currently trying to broker a deal .
" we would hope that greece and macedonia will be able to accept a way forward , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after the meeting .
unclear map for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about georgia 's commitment to democracy but it was n't only macedonia 's membership that hit a snag . the former soviet countries of georgia and ukraine had hoped to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- similar to what the balkan countries had gone through .
map prepares a country for eventual entry into nato .
but it was unclear whether they had the enough support to begin the map process .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he remained “ skeptical ” about both countries ' chances .
in ukraine , public opinion polls show many people strongly oppose joining nato .
and nato members were alarmed by georgia 's decision to declare a state of emergency in december 2007 to put an end to opposition protests .
the “ russia factor ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has opposed nato expansion besides democracy worries , there was also concern that allowing georgia and ukraine into the nato club would anger russia .
while russia ca n't block nato membership , there 's a sense that the move would further aggravate an already-strained relationship .
russia has deeply opposed both kosovo 's independence and united states missile shield plans .
“ we have a new president in russia and i think the european union wants to put its ties with russia on another footing , ” said luxembourg 's jean asselborn .
“ we have to take the interests of others , not only of nato members , into account . ”
even the us , which has backed both countries ' accession bids , seemed reluctant to push the issue thursday .
at the end of the meeting officials said only that " a broad spectrum of views " had come up in relation to the two countries .
a plan for afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is sceptical of georgia and ukraine 's chances while nato seemed stalled on expansion plans , it did agree on a comprehensive afghan strategy thursday .
the plan combines desires by some allies for more help in fighting the taliban with demands from other allies that attention be paid to reconstruction and nation building .
us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have done the brunt of the fighting against the taliban in afghanistan 's south while allies like germany , france and italy have been reluctant to send troops there .
secretary of state rice , who had criticized nato allies ' reluctance to join the fighting , sounded a conciliatory note thursday .
" germany , like others , is contributing to the efforts and that is greatly appreciated , " rice said .
however , she stressed that defeating terrorism and the taliban remain a priority .
reconstruction , governance and rule of law is not enough , rice said .
" we have to win against the insurgents , we have to help the afghans , train the army , and it is a shared view that we need more help in that regard , " she added . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , only a tunnel could spare its unesco title . if dresden builds a bridge across the elbe river , its world heritage title will be revoked , said unesco .
all of the structures the city has proposed to ease traffic would disrupt the view of dresden 's most significant landmarks : the church of our lady , the city 's cathedral and the semper opera . " a tunnel would mean a much smaller encroachment , " a unesco spokesman told the thursday , march 6 , edition of the sächsische zeitung .
" none of the alternative bridges can preserve the landscape . " on wednesday , a four-person committee - made up of german federal and state politicians as well as a university professor - met in paris with the director of unesco 's world heritage center , francesco bandarin , to discuss the situation . dresden had presented a new draft of a less bulky bridge in january and unesco representatives traveled to the saxon capital last month to inspect the scene . support for tunnel grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most recent bridge plan was meant to harmonize with the surroundings " now we have clarity , " state politician martin dulig told news agency dpa after wednesday 's meeting , referring to the un body 's rejection of all of the bridge drafts .
" the question of what to do now has to be resolved in dresden - and fast . " dresden 's city council will meet on march 13 to decide whether to proceed with a bridge in spite of the unesco decision - construction on a bridge has been underway since november - or to build a tunnel beneath the elbe river .
the project was initiated as a way to alleviate traffic into the city . some 40,000 signatures have been collected in dresden as part of a petition supporting a tunnel .
demonstrations against the bridge are planned for this saturday . currently , 32 of unesco 's 851 world cultural heritage sites are located in germany .
due to the bridge project , dresden has been on the list of endangered sites since 2006 .

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .

also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , only a tunnel could spare its unesco title . if dresden builds a bridge across the elbe river , its world heritage title will be revoked , said unesco .
all of the structures the city has proposed to ease traffic would disrupt the view of dresden 's most significant landmarks : the church of our lady , the city 's cathedral and the semper opera . " a tunnel would mean a much smaller encroachment , " a unesco spokesman told the thursday , march 6 , edition of the sächsische zeitung .
" none of the alternative bridges can preserve the landscape . " on wednesday , a four-person committee - made up of german federal and state politicians as well as a university professor - met in paris with the director of unesco 's world heritage center , francesco bandarin , to discuss the situation . dresden had presented a new draft of a less bulky bridge in january and unesco representatives traveled to the saxon capital last month to inspect the scene . support for tunnel grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most recent bridge plan was meant to harmonize with the surroundings " now we have clarity , " state politician martin dulig told news agency dpa after wednesday 's meeting , referring to the un body 's rejection of all of the bridge drafts .
" the question of what to do now has to be resolved in dresden - and fast . " dresden 's city council will meet on march 13 to decide whether to proceed with a bridge in spite of the unesco decision - construction on a bridge has been underway since november - or to build a tunnel beneath the elbe river .
the project was initiated as a way to alleviate traffic into the city . some 40,000 signatures have been collected in dresden as part of a petition supporting a tunnel .
demonstrations against the bridge are planned for this saturday . currently , 32 of unesco 's 851 world cultural heritage sites are located in germany .
due to the bridge project , dresden has been on the list of endangered sites since 2006 .

this year 's anniversary comes as the left party is on its way to doing the very same thing . twenty-eight green parliamentarians took their place in the bundestag on march 6 , 1983 , heralding in a new era for the environmentalist party at the federal level and the birth of a four-party system in west germany .
the conservative cdu / csu sneered as the newly elected parliamentarians , in long beards , overalls and woolly sweaters , reveled in their new roles as the people 's representatives . as in the case of the left party today , the greens had been dubbed a protest party and political actors debated fiercely whether the established parties dared forge alliances with them .

in the early days , the greens ' politics were marked by doomsday scenarios : fears of nuclear war and the effects unchecked capitalism on nature .
german reunification and the resulting merger of the west german greens with the east german civil activist group " alliance 90 " were historical turning points that shifted the party towards consolidation into a " real " party . coming of age controversial issues during the greens first legislative period , such as pacifism or the ability to govern , lost their explosiveness over time .

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "

while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .
greece nixes macedonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians have rioted over the " name issue " yet nato membership for macedonia wo n't come without greek approval .
all members of the alliance have to agree before a new member is admitted .
bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .
nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer underscored that the alliance will not overrule greece in the dispute .
" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .
“ nato works by consensus . ”
de hoop scheffer said he hopes to find a solution by the time of a nato summit planned for the romanian capital of bucharest on april 2-4 .

skopje has proposed using the name “ macedonia ” in all cases except with athens , where it has offered to use a name acceptable to both parties .
so far , greece has n't agreed , although a nato envoy is currently trying to broker a deal .
" we would hope that greece and macedonia will be able to accept a way forward , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after the meeting .
unclear map for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about georgia 's commitment to democracy but it was n't only macedonia 's membership that hit a snag . the former soviet countries of georgia and ukraine had hoped to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- similar to what the balkan countries had gone through .
map prepares a country for eventual entry into nato .
but it was unclear whether they had the enough support to begin the map process .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he remained “ skeptical ” about both countries ' chances .
in ukraine , public opinion polls show many people strongly oppose joining nato .
and nato members were alarmed by georgia 's decision to declare a state of emergency in december 2007 to put an end to opposition protests .
the “ russia factor ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has opposed nato expansion besides democracy worries , there was also concern that allowing georgia and ukraine into the nato club would anger russia .
while russia ca n't block nato membership , there 's a sense that the move would further aggravate an already-strained relationship .
russia has deeply opposed both kosovo 's independence and united states missile shield plans .
“ we have a new president in russia and i think the european union wants to put its ties with russia on another footing , ” said luxembourg 's jean asselborn .
“ we have to take the interests of others , not only of nato members , into account . ”
even the us , which has backed both countries ' accession bids , seemed reluctant to push the issue thursday .
at the end of the meeting officials said only that " a broad spectrum of views " had come up in relation to the two countries .
a plan for afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is sceptical of georgia and ukraine 's chances while nato seemed stalled on expansion plans , it did agree on a comprehensive afghan strategy thursday .
the plan combines desires by some allies for more help in fighting the taliban with demands from other allies that attention be paid to reconstruction and nation building .
us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have done the brunt of the fighting against the taliban in afghanistan 's south while allies like germany , france and italy have been reluctant to send troops there .
secretary of state rice , who had criticized nato allies ' reluctance to join the fighting , sounded a conciliatory note thursday .
" germany , like others , is contributing to the efforts and that is greatly appreciated , " rice said .
however , she stressed that defeating terrorism and the taliban remain a priority .

" none of the alternative bridges can preserve the landscape . " on wednesday , a four-person committee - made up of german federal and state politicians as well as a university professor - met in paris with the director of unesco 's world heritage center , francesco bandarin , to discuss the situation . dresden had presented a new draft of a less bulky bridge in january and unesco representatives traveled to the saxon capital last month to inspect the scene . support for tunnel grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most recent bridge plan was meant to harmonize with the surroundings " now we have clarity , " state politician martin dulig told news agency dpa after wednesday 's meeting , referring to the un body 's rejection of all of the bridge drafts .

29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .

meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .
if the democrats win the presidential election , that scenario would be even more likely , cote said .

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .

meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”

instead , only a tunnel could spare its unesco title . if dresden builds a bridge across the elbe river , its world heritage title will be revoked , said unesco .
all of the structures the city has proposed to ease traffic would disrupt the view of dresden 's most significant landmarks : the church of our lady , the city 's cathedral and the semper opera . " a tunnel would mean a much smaller encroachment , " a unesco spokesman told the thursday , march 6 , edition of the sächsische zeitung .
" none of the alternative bridges can preserve the landscape . " on wednesday , a four-person committee - made up of german federal and state politicians as well as a university professor - met in paris with the director of unesco 's world heritage center , francesco bandarin , to discuss the situation . dresden had presented a new draft of a less bulky bridge in january and unesco representatives traveled to the saxon capital last month to inspect the scene . support for tunnel grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most recent bridge plan was meant to harmonize with the surroundings " now we have clarity , " state politician martin dulig told news agency dpa after wednesday 's meeting , referring to the un body 's rejection of all of the bridge drafts .
" the question of what to do now has to be resolved in dresden - and fast . " dresden 's city council will meet on march 13 to decide whether to proceed with a bridge in spite of the unesco decision - construction on a bridge has been underway since november - or to build a tunnel beneath the elbe river .
the project was initiated as a way to alleviate traffic into the city . some 40,000 signatures have been collected in dresden as part of a petition supporting a tunnel .
demonstrations against the bridge are planned for this saturday . currently , 32 of unesco 's 851 world cultural heritage sites are located in germany .
due to the bridge project , dresden has been on the list of endangered sites since 2006 .

the fast track bid of the balkan trio of croatia , macedonia and albania also hit a major snag . the informal meeting of nato 's foreign ministers in brussels on thursday , march 6 was supposed to prepare the way for the so-called “ adriatic trio ” to join the transatlantic military alliance as well as put ukraine and georgia on an eventual path to nato membership .
while ministers seemed ready to give the nod to croatia and albania , the balkan countries might be entering without neighboring macedonia .
the former yugoslav republic 's bid hit a major roadblock on thursday in the form of a greek veto threat .
balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .

balkan membership not a done deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should belong to nato ?
greece has refused to accept macedonia due to displeasure over the country 's name , which it shares with the northern greek province of macedonia , birthplace of alexander the great .
according to nato officials and diplomats , all three of the balkan countries have largely met the technical criteria to join the 26-nation military alliance . all were expected to join at the same time .
" greece supports the candidacy of albania and croatia , " said greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis , but added that her country would veto macedonia 's entry .
the european union has been eager for the balkan countries to join nato in the hopes that it will bring stability to the region , particularly in light of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence from serbia .
the european union underlined its interest in balkan stability on wednesday when it launched a new initiative to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries .
the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank .

bakoyannis said " nobody likes vetoes " and promised that " greece will continue to work in a constructive spirit for a mutually acceptable solution . "
one diplomat said that she had urged the ministers not to " force greece to commit political suicide , " as the issue could provoke nationalism within greece and add to tensions elsewhere in the region .

" there 's an ally , greece , and a non ally , macedonia , " he said thursday after the meeting ended .

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama were upset by the news boeing seeks clarification shearon quantified the number of us jobs endangered by the deal at 40,000 .
meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .
if the democrats win the presidential election , that scenario would be even more likely , cote said .
" but i think the worst-case scenario for airbus is that the decision will be put off , maybe by a year .
but it probably wo n't be overturned . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.03.2008 chorus of protests greet pentagon 's airbus decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon snubbed boeing in its plan to revamp its refuelling air tankers the pentagon ’ s surprise decision to buy refuelling tankers for the us air force from european defense contractor eads instead of the heavily-favored boeing has set off a storm of protest in the us . the air force decision to award an airbus / northrup grumman team a $ 35 billion -lrb- 23 billion euro -rrb- contract over us rival boeing is still sending off ripples in the us political establishment .
the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama were upset by the news boeing seeks clarification shearon quantified the number of us jobs endangered by the deal at 40,000 .
meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .
if the democrats win the presidential election , that scenario would be even more likely , cote said .
" but i think the worst-case scenario for airbus is that the decision will be put off , maybe by a year .
but it probably wo n't be overturned . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama were upset by the news boeing seeks clarification shearon quantified the number of us jobs endangered by the deal at 40,000 .
meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .
if the democrats win the presidential election , that scenario would be even more likely , cote said .

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it seems that the eu is setting a new course in its dealing with the divided country . brussels ' new path is evident in two recent decisions .
at the end of february , the european union , the united states and russia decided to leave their high representatives to bosnia-herzegovina in the country indefinitely .
originally , the plan had been to pull them out in 2008 and let the country become a sovereign state , but according to brussels , it 's much too early for that step . the second path-setter , announced on wednesday , march 5 , came in the form of a catalogue of new initiatives intended to promote civil society and enhance economic and social development in all seven of the balkan countries . the measures include easing visa requirements , more funding for student scholarships and extensive loans from the european investment bank . for the first time , brussels is supporting the democratization of individual countries like bosnia-herzegovina with a policy that applies to all the balkan states . following kosovo 's example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bosnian serbs see kosovo 's independence as a precedence setter some 4 million people live in bosnia-herzegovina : half of them are muslim , a third is serbian and a fifth is croatian . after the civil war -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- , the country was divided into two independent parts - the so-called republic of srbska , with an ethnic serb majority , and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
since then , both sides have blocked the possibility of democratic self-administration .
even the international community 's high representative was n't able to wrest the country from its political deadlock , despite having dictator-like authority . bosnia-herzegovina seems to be caught in its worst political crisis since the end of the civil war , which most political observers attribute to kosovo 's recent declaration of independence . kosovar independence " set the precedence that the borders of constituent republics are n't sacrosanct , " said balkan expert dusan reljic from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . many bosnian serbs have come to the conclusion that what goes for kosovo should also apply to the serbian republic that is part of bosnia-herzegovina .
but this kind of logic is threatening to break up the nation . eu visa policy not equitable wolfgang petritsch , who served as the un 's high representative to bosnian and herzegovina from 1999 to 2002 , is among the critics of the eu 's balkan policy . " the fundamental problem behind europe 's balkan policy is that it 's only progressed very selectively and no one had looked at the greater context or the influence that the various hot spots have on each other , " said petritsch . the european commission 's most recent offer to all seven balkan countries seems long overdue .
according to reljic , the differing visa requirements for bosnian croats on the one hand and bosnian serbs and muslims on the other is one of the policies that should have been changed a long time ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petritsch said time is a key factor in bringing sustainable change since the bosnian croats not only have bosnian but also croatian passports , they are granted free entry into the european union , but muslims and serbs need a visa . " all the people in the western balkan region need to be allowed to travel into the eu , " said reljic .
" during 40 years of communism in yugoslavia , people could travel to the west and now , after 15 years of democracy , they 're not allowed to anymore . " a matter of time nevertheless , the eu 's new comprehensive approach to the balkans is n't likely to be a quick fix .
rather , regional experts take a rather bleak view as far as the near future of the balkans goes . building a functioning state system have always been underestimated , said petritsch .
only now has it become apparent that 12 years are n't enough but that it 's more a question of generations , he added . the former high representative said the eu may have to keep the peace in bosnia-herzegovina for another 20 years , as ethnic barriers are likely to remain until the country eventually joins the bloc . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2008 europe warily eyes window of opportunity in cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidel castro may no longer be president but his influence over cuba remains strong louis michel , the european commissioner for development and aid , leads an eu delegation to cuba on thursday , feb .
6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .

when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to assess the political climate after the retirement of president fidel castro . when fidel castro stepped down as president of cuba last month after 49 years in power , the main question asked by the international community was whether democratic change could be expected in the wake of his abdication .
a european union delegation travels to havana this week to see for itself if a new climate exists where normalized ties and engagement can survive .
dw-world.de asked the opinions of three experts on the future of eu-cuban relations . thiago de aragao is the latin american senior research associate at the foreign policy center , a london-based european think-tank .
dr. juan diaz is the director of the css project for integrative mediation , a berlin-based conflict resolution project financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs .
dr. karen smith is a reader in international relations at the london school of economics . dw-world.de : how would you describe relations between the european union and cuba while fidel castro was in power ? thiago de aragao : the relationship was one of observation and monitoring .
due to obvious reasons , spain always had closer ties with cuba .
as i recall , the spanish embassy was always one of the busiest and most active in havana .
during the latter years , castro was more flexible towards international dialogue , especially with spain .
the european union never expected important changes while castro was in power .
louis michel , european commissioner for development , always analyzed cuba closely .
he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is the one that maintained high hope for the development of political talks with cuba . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel has been the eu 's point man on cuba dr. juan diaz : the relationship has been on and off for many years . it seems that the eu , mostly due to spain but also italy , has tried to develop a constructive dialogue with cuba . however , every time the eu opens up to cuba and sends out signals , cuba seems to find a way to complicate matters . dr. karen smith : the eu has never had what i would call ' institutionalized ' relations with cuba , meaning there is no official , legal agreement between the eu and cuba , but the member states can and do engage extensively with the country .
eu policy has been a mixture of ' un-institutionalized ' engagement and very light and occasional negative measures .
light diplomatic sanctions were imposed in 2003 but have been suspended since 2005 . what were the main areas of conflict between eu and cuba and what were the reasons for these ? tda : the lack of disposition from the europeans toward cuba made it difficult to advance in conversations that could produce conflicts .
when the soviet union died , cuba also died to most european governments .
their expectations for democratic openings on the caribbean island never surpassed the rhetorical value .
in absolute terms , cuba never represented anything of any worth for most european powers . jd : specific issues of concerns have included the eu ambassadors ' demand that they are free to invite anyone to the embassies for events , and the arrest of dissidents .
fidel seems to have it in for eu foreign policy chief javier solana and has criticized him publicly on numerous occasions . this makes it difficult for the eu to implement a dialogue .
but it continues to try . ks : democracy and human rights have always been areas of conflict .
in addition , cuba is a leading country of the non-aligned movement , which generally opposes many eu positions within the un , for example within the human rights council .
to the extent that the un matters for the eu , then cuban ' resistance ' is an important area of conflict . had there been any movement towards better relations towards the end of fidel 's reign or had relations always been on an even-keel , either positively or negatively ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castro brothers pose different problems for the eu tda : the relationship has always been superficial .
the only difference has been the relationship between cuba and spain , which due to history has been deeper .
spain always encouraged talks between the countries in the hope of democratic openings .
in a way , talking with fidel was easier than talking to raul will be as fidel is a more diplomatic character .
on the other hand , raul recognizes the need for certain changes for the sake of cuba 's future .
if fidel was easier to talk to but harder to convince , i believe raul is the other way around . has the eu always taken a stance on cuba in line with that of the united states ? tda : i believe the eu 's policy towards cuba is partially linked with us policy .
in terms of democratic values , the european union and the us are linked .
on the other hand , the policy practiced by the us is a legacy of the cold war .
the proximity of cuba to the us means it has a different kind of relationship than the one the eu has with cuba .
also , the amount of cuban immigrants in the united states is a good enough reason to shape a foreign policy in different terms than the europeans have .
the eu has always given moral support to the united states , but very little effective support . jd : the eu does not follow the us position but it is mindful to avoid as much as possible an irritation in the transatlantic relationship . the eu actually follows its own thinking on cuba . ks : the eu 's position is not in line with that of the us .
the eu has been firmly opposed to extraterritorial application of us sanctions on cuba .
however , its policy towards cuba is necessarily linked to that of the us given washington ’ s predominance in the region and also because member states would not wish to jeopardize good relations with the us over an issue like cuba . what would have been the european union ’ s reaction to the news that fidel castro was stepping down ?
would the eu see this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for more democracy in cuba ? tda : i believe everyone is seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen relations and push for democracy .
during the last 50 years , we learned that fidel castro was a tough negotiator and really believed in the cause he was defending .
when he stepped down , the world saw it as a revitalized opportunity to restart conversations and keep aiming for democratic openings .
we must remember he is stepping down , but he is not dead .
even away from the chair , he is still deciding and talking every single day with cuba .
the navigator of the ship might change , but while he is alive , the course will remain fairly the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy and dialogue with cuba are the eu 's aims ks : this abdication has been on the cards for a while .
but does it present an opportunity for change ?
slowly , perhaps ; but it could also be seen as an opportunity not to have to push too hard for democracy on the grounds that there is liberalization going on , and one would n't want to jeopardize that .
instead i see it as a chance to strengthen economic links which would be justified with the argument that economic growth and liberalization would lead eventually to more political liberalization .
in any event , eu policy will undoubtedly depend on the outcome of elections in spain , arguably the main driving force behind any eu policy towards cuba ; though the czech republic for one may try to push for a policy more tilted towards encouraging democracy and punishing any backsliding on that . is the eu ’ s main goal a democratic cuba ?
what does it stand to gain from a change in ideology in cuba ?
does the eu have another agenda ? tda : in economic terms , cuba represents very little to the eu , the us , china , brazil and other powerhouses .
the main interest is definitely on the promotion of democracy .
we must remember cuba has very rich mining fields , though the exploration is still very amateurish .
perhaps a relaxation of restrictions could attract foreign mining companies .
besides the democratic opportunity , perhaps the availability of cuban cigars is the main interest right now . jd : i think that the eu seeks to assist the people of cuba to develop their society and the eu believes that democratic values , respect for human rights and economic freedom are part of this development . however , they do not necessarily believe that sanctions are the most appropriate ways of achieving these goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies could be looking to invest in cuba ks : at a rhetorical level , yes the eu wants a democratic cuba but in practice it hasn ’ t pushed particularly hard for this as it doesn ’ t want to be seen to be too close to the hard-line us position .
the eu stands to gain in the removal of an issue causing some tensions with us and also the chance for more trade .
a more open cuba could be included in the cotonou convention and therefore in the economic partnership agreement with the caribbean states . does the handing of the reins to raul castro signify any opportunity for a change in relations between the eu and cuba ? tda : it is the beginning of a new era .
the most important shift to be seen from fidel stepping down is the increase in governmental responsibility that his vice-president carlos lage will have .
i believe he is the man to look at , not raul castro .
for years carlos lage controlled the operations of the government machinery .
fidel worked mostly like the " queen of england " in cuba .
since raul is less charismatic than fidel , carlos lage will be more " hands on " during this new phase .
lage is more modern and admires very much the chinese model .
if there is a negative reaction towards raul from the population , than lage will gain in power and strength and will consequently have more opportunities to implement economic and political possibilities . what does raul castro mean in terms for cuba ’ s future role in the world ?
does he represent the same obstinacy to change and opposition as embodied by his brother or could he be a reformer of any type ? tda : i don ’ t think he represents the same obstinacy as his brother .
raul knows that the world today is different .
fidel is the king of a kingdom that failed to meet his standards .
the vast majority of the world knows that .
raul will represent more the image of a melancholic past than the possibility of a socialist future .
he will be like the owner of a beeper store in a world of mobile phones .
people may be nostalgic , but that doesn ’ t mean they will buy them anymore . jd : it is too early to tell whether raul will change cuba . for now he has shown that stability and continuity are priorities . some say he is interested in economic reform . but the cuban government always sought to develop economically and reform is part of that . what will the eu delegation heading to cuba this week hope to achieve ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could carlos lage be cuba 's most likely agent of change ?
tda : they will hope to understand the new structure of the cuban government .
they will ask themselves questions : to what extent is fidel still the boss ?
what is the public opinion towards raul ?
how modern and effective is carlos lage ?
how the population is dealing with this new period ?
i believe these are the key questions the eu officials are aiming to answer . jd : i think the main aim for the eu delegation is to restart a constructive dialogue with cuba . raul castro is not a young man .
when it is his time to step down , are there any young potential leaders-in-waiting and if so , who are they , what are their beliefs ?
are they young revolutionaries or is there a movement for democratic change just waiting to claim cuba once the old guard is gone for good ? tda : carlos lage is the strongest at the moment .
he is only 56 ; an open-minded , admirer of the chinese economy and one who is aware of the difficulties of his country .
between fidel , raul and lage , he is the one that knows the world he lives in .
he can differentiate between utopia and realism . jd : there is much speculation as to what might or might not happen but cuba has demonstrated time and again that it will not be dictated to by the us or europe and it resists pressure . many thought that finally carlos lage , economically liberal and moderate in the government , would have received a more prominent role . but he did not .
whether this will change in time , we will just have to wait and see . interviews : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.03.2008 chorus of protests greet pentagon 's airbus decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon snubbed boeing in its plan to revamp its refuelling air tankers the pentagon ’ s surprise decision to buy refuelling tankers for the us air force from european defense contractor eads instead of the heavily-favored boeing has set off a storm of protest in the us . the air force decision to award an airbus / northrup grumman team a $ 35 billion -lrb- 23 billion euro -rrb- contract over us rival boeing is still sending off ripples in the us political establishment .
the decision on friday , feb .
29 , to give the contract for refuelling tankers to airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- came as a complete surprise to both us defense contractor boeing - which was heavily favored to get the contract - and us lawmakers alike .
with follow-up contracts , the deal could eventually be worth $ 100 billion .
concern for us jobs but while european political and industry leaders are celebrating the decision , us lawmakers have expressed outrage - particularly senators from the states of washington and kansas .
those are the home states of boeing plants , and they stand to take the hardest economic hit from the lost deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pelosi is demanding an explanation lawmakers from those states wrote to defense secretary robert gates on monday demanding an explanation .
" the airbus contract is a european stimulus plan subsidized by the american taxpayer , " wrote senator patty murray of washington .
" we need to be investing in the american aerospace industry and the high-wage , high-skill jobs it supports . "
now , the us congress has said it would examine the military 's decision on the contract , lawmakers said .
" the air force 's decision to award the contract for a much-needed modernization of the nation 's aerial tanker fleet to northrop grumman and airbus raises serious questions that congress must examine thoroughly , " house speaker nancy pelosi said on tuesday , march 4 .
' subsidy for the french government ' " given the ramifications of this decision for the united states , the air force must explain to congress how it meets the long-term needs of our military and the american people , " she said .
pelosi , who leads the democratic party majority in the house of representatives , said among the questions lawmakers should examine are the implications for us national security of choosing " an aircraft supplied by a foreign firm " and the effect on the country 's employment and " technological base . "
it is unimaginable that an enormous deal like that would go to a foreign concern , concurred paul shearon of the international federation of professional and technical engineers .
" we are talking about well-paid , highly valued american jobs .
in this case we are using our tax dollars to buy subsidized products .
it is a subsidy for the french government , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama were upset by the news boeing seeks clarification shearon quantified the number of us jobs endangered by the deal at 40,000 .
meanwhile , boeing on tuesday said it had asked the air force for an " immediate " explanation for its decision to reject boeing 's bid . as of tuesday , boeing said it had not yet received a briefing on the decision , and pointed out that the air force had said a briefing would occur on or after march 12 .
it called the delay " inconsistent with well-established procurement practices . "
" a delay of this length in the formal debriefing is unusual , " mark mcgraw , boeing vice president of the 767 tanker programs , told afp news service .
in addition , the candidates in the ongoing presidential primaries have jumped on the issue .
boeing history may have played role presidential candidate barack obama expressed shock at the deal .
hillary clinton said she found it incomprehensible that airbus – a company charged before the world trade organization with receiving illegal subsidies – would win the contract .
however , some observers say boeing itself is partly to blame for the loss .
in 2003 , the company received a leasing contract for refuelling tankers , but it was revealed that the head of pentagon purchasing at the time had been offered a lucrative job at boeing .
the affair cost then-boeing ceo phil condit his job .
what 's more , the airbus refuelling tanker is said to be superior to that of boeing .
still , no one expected airbus to get the contract , acknowledged owen cote , an international security expert at the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
" it was a shock that airbus got the deal ; especially for the politicians , for congressmen- and women in washington . ”
unlikely deal will be reversed he believes it is possible – but not likely - that the deal could be overturned with enough political pressure .
" it is possible that with political pressure , the decision could be reverseed , “ he said .
if the democrats win the presidential election , that scenario would be even more likely , cote said .
" but i think the worst-case scenario for airbus is that the decision will be put off , maybe by a year .
but it probably wo n't be overturned . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the stores have small staffs and save money on expenses like decor , advertising , and even shelf-stocking - wares are sold directly from loading pallets .
savings are passed on to customers . reclusive lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare photo of theo albrecht was taken after a 17-day kidnapping ordeal aldi long ago expanded to non-food items like textiles and hardware .

the wild success of aldi at home led to expansion overseas , and today aldi stores can be found around the globe .
in the united states , it owns the popular supermarket chain trader joe 's . despite their outlandish business success , the brothers have managed to keep their private lives almost entirely under wraps , howard hughes-style .
any chance of their opening up to the public was definitively quashed after theo survived a kidnapping attempt in 1971 ; he was freed from 17 days in captivity after paying a 7 million mark ransom . but word does occasionally leak out about them .
karl retired in the 1980s , leaving the company in the hands of non-family members .

this week about 600,000 families were told which secondary school their children will attend in september .
but the survey , based on results from 140 out of 150 education authorities , points to a divided country .
in london , an average 65 % of children were offered their first choice , compared to 87 % in the rest of england .
in leicestershire , redcar and cleveland , 98 % of 10 and 11-year-olds will be joining their first choice secondary schools in september .
distortions the survey revealed exceptions within the bigger picture .
in birmingham , for example , less than two thirds of pupils got their first preference schools .
the bbc survey also suggests there may be greater dissatisfaction this year , with more than half of the authorities who took part recording a smaller proportion of successful first preferences than last year .
this may result in there being more appeals .
how to appeal for a school place official statistics are due to be published next week by the department for children , schools and families .
school choices england average outside london : 87 % london average : 65 % leicestershire , redcar and cleveland : 98 % the figures obtained by the bbc survey broadly confirm last year 's statistics from most local authorities .
but gary eason , the bbc news website 's education editor , said admission figures should be treated with caution as a number of factors skewed the outcomes .
" a notable distortion is seen in areas of academic selection - where many children did not get into their first choice of school simply because they did not pass the 11-plus tests , " he said .
he also said some schools used to insist they would only consider children who had made them their first preference , so parents played safe and tended to put down a school they felt sure of getting into .
now that practice is banned , he said , parents can make what local officials categorise as unrealistic first preferences , safe in the knowledge it will not adversely affect their chance of getting into another school .

more than 100 properties have been unoccupied for longer than a decade .
the figures have been obtained under the freedom of information act .
some houses are in such poor repair they can not be lived in .
the government says it has to keep them empty for families coming back from abroad and moving between postings .
' disgusting ' at 48 flats in putney in south london , the carpets are clean and the paint looks fresh .
the grass is freshly mown in the children 's playground .
but they are all empty .
the bbc understands that has been the case since 2004 .
windows are open in some blocks .
several doors to the communal areas are not locked .
post and advertising flyers dating back to 2005 lie in piles on the floor .
" i think it 's absolutely disgusting , " says one local woman who does not want to be named .
" they should sell these off and they 'd be worth an absolute fortune . "
the blocks are owned by a private company and rented by the mod for service families .
years empty the government sold off all its service family housing in england and wales in 1996 to annington homes .
it now rents back about 41,000 .
sure they have to mothball housing - but they do n't have to leave it empty david ireland empty homes agency today , 7,489 are unoccupied .
the mod can end a lease with six months ' notice and hand them back to annington .
after a request under the freedom of information act , bbc news has learned that 2,410 have been empty for more than year .
six hundred have been empty for more than three years and 104 for over a decade .
the total cost of rent , maintenance and council tax over the last 12 months alone is £ 13.7m.
the mod says it knows there are too many empty homes and is " actively on the case " .
' surrey slums ' officials maintain they are trying to match the numbers of houses to the changing needs of the military , in the most cost effective way .
they also point out the mod has to keep a large number vacant because of what it calls " churn " - that is , the high tempo of deployments back from overseas and within the uk .
as for the 104 houses which have been empty for more than 10 years , many are behind the security fences on sensitive bases so can not be handed back .
but even when it does terminate leases , the mod still has to pay for repairs .
fifty houses near pirbright in surrey have been empty since 2004 .
windows are broken , doors are boarded up and walls have collapsed .
there is fresh graffiti which says " surrey slums " .
short term proposal the mod has now decided to give notice and will hand these back by the end of the year .
the mod has to pay for repairs to the homes left unoccupied but it will have to pay for repairs .
last year , the average bill for dilapidations was more than £ 6,000 per house .
" sure they have to mothball housing - but they do n't have to leave it empty , " says david ireland , who runs the empty homes agency .
the agency is a charity set up to try and make the best use of vacant property .
mr ireland believes the mod could sub-let to civilians for as little as three months .
" it provides housing for a group of people who otherwise do n't get housed , and for the military it 's got someone living on site taking care of it , " he adds .
last year , the defence select committee also criticised the mod 's management of its housing stock .
it said there were too many empty properties .
some accommodation was described as appalling .
the mod points out it is spending £ 50m this year on improving family housing .

money talk by nick salter barnett waddingham actuaries nick salter of barnett waddingham actuaries the recent decision by rank to sell its pension scheme was the latest in a small but growing number of such deals .
the rank fund , with all its assets and liabilities , was sold to rothesay life , which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of goldman sachs .
other companies are expected to do the same and sell their pension schemes to entities set up specifically for the purpose .
whilst this may well be good for rank and , indeed , for goldman sachs , what impact does it really have on the members of the pension scheme ?
secure retirement in the uk , defined benefit pension schemes were traditionally set up by employers who wanted to ensure that their employees were able to earn a pension that would allow them to retire with sufficient income to maintain their standard of living .
employers have become less paternalistic towards their employees rank sell its pension scheme this was , somewhat arbitrarily , often set at two-thirds of the income that a member received whilst working .
the idea was that maybe one-third of one 's income whilst working was spent undertaking the job itself - buying work clothing , commuting to work and so on .
employers set these schemes up voluntarily and created pensions trusts to hold the assets against the promises made .
the voluntary nature of the promise has come under fire from successive governments .
the effect of this is that virtually no employers are setting up defined benefit , or final salary , pension schemes for their staff any longer .
that is because there is now an obligation that , if you do set up a scheme , the members have to be paid their benefits whatever the financial situation of the employer .
paternalism disappears historically , the promise was only as good as the assets in the pension scheme supporting it .
pension changes can be very controversial these government changes , introduced in good faith , have , as so often , had the equal and opposite effect to the intentions of the government .
instead of making pensions more secure they have had the effect of reducing the overall pension coverage .
at the same time employers have become less paternalistic towards their employees .
they are happier now to put in place defined contribution pension arrangements .
in these , the employee , rather than the employer , carries all the investment and longevity risks associated with planning for retirement .
against this background , do these pension buyouts really make any difference to the members of the schemes ?
does it matter that the people standing behind the pension promise are us bankers rather than the uk employer ?
on the whole the answer to this is probably not .
a winning situation ?
a uk employer may be a good company who understands how to manufacture widgets , operate gambling facilities , or whatever , and that is where the management 's attention probably should be focused .
one side wants to get rid of the risk whilst the other side is prepared to take it on pension buy-outs gather pace but there are significant risks associated with running a defined benefit pension scheme and the management team needs to be fully familiar with those risks .
to this end it probably makes sense to transfer the pension scheme to a management team that is dedicated to controlling those risks .
this is the reason that these deals happen - one side wants to get rid of the risk whilst the other side is prepared to take it on .
the company selling the risk -lrb- rank last week -rrb- places a high value on that risk because it does not like it .
the company that buys the risk places a lower value on it because it understands the risks that it is taking on .
consequently , any price set between these two values will be a win / win situation for the two companies .
risks does this mean that there is any less security for the member ?
what if something goes wrong - the new managers make a hash of the investments or we all live for much longer than was previously expected ?
again , the answer here is that there is probably no greater risk than there was before .
the trustees of the pension scheme need to ensure that the pensions regulator is fully informed as to the intended transaction .
one of his main interests will be to ensure that the new backer is at least as strong as the transferring company .
furthermore , as explained above , the new backers will understand pension risks better and should , theoretically , make fewer mistakes in the operation of the pension scheme .
changes of course , two things do change .
members of uk pension schemes know that if the pension scheme has insufficient assets they can turn to the uk employer to make good those assets marconi pensions ' threat ' blocked the first is that the new pension scheme owners will not allow members to earn any further benefit .
in other words , the employees of the transferring company will need to earn future pension benefits through another pension scheme -lrb- probably a defined contribution one -rrb- .
secondly , the new owners will not provide any benefits that may have been provided on a discretionary basis .
the rules of most uk pension schemes set out the " guaranteed " level of benefits and then specify that the trustees and the employer between them might agree to provide additional benefits in certain circumstances .
it is extremely unlikely that any such discretionary benefits will be provided in the future .
finally , members of uk pension schemes know that if the pension scheme has insufficient assets they can turn to the uk employer to make good those assets .
safety net if the employer can not fund a scheme properly , then the pension scheme is likely to be eligible to go into the pension protection fund -lrb- ppf -rrb- .
that way members will get compensation at a lower level than the pension benefits they expected , but even so they will not be penniless .
the new owners of uk pension schemes may be employers themselves , stepping into the shoes of the old employer .
in this case members will be equally entitled to compensation in the event that the new owner goes bust .
or they may be set up as insurance companies in which case members should be entitled to cover , under the policyholders ' protection act .
this provides less than full compensation but at a comparable type of level to the ppf .
so , to answer my question above as to whether members should be concerned , i do not think so .
it would be easy to get emotive , but the chances are that it is all rather too late because most employers no longer have a paternalistic view of their employees when it comes to pension provision .

money talk by nick salter barnett waddingham actuaries nick salter of barnett waddingham actuaries the recent decision by rank to sell its pension scheme was the latest in a small but growing number of such deals .
the rank fund , with all its assets and liabilities , was sold to rothesay life , which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of goldman sachs .
other companies are expected to do the same and sell their pension schemes to entities set up specifically for the purpose .
whilst this may well be good for rank and , indeed , for goldman sachs , what impact does it really have on the members of the pension scheme ?
secure retirement in the uk , defined benefit pension schemes were traditionally set up by employers who wanted to ensure that their employees were able to earn a pension that would allow them to retire with sufficient income to maintain their standard of living .
employers have become less paternalistic towards their employees rank sell its pension scheme this was , somewhat arbitrarily , often set at two-thirds of the income that a member received whilst working .
the idea was that maybe one-third of one 's income whilst working was spent undertaking the job itself - buying work clothing , commuting to work and so on .
employers set these schemes up voluntarily and created pensions trusts to hold the assets against the promises made .
the voluntary nature of the promise has come under fire from successive governments .
the effect of this is that virtually no employers are setting up defined benefit , or final salary , pension schemes for their staff any longer .
that is because there is now an obligation that , if you do set up a scheme , the members have to be paid their benefits whatever the financial situation of the employer .
paternalism disappears historically , the promise was only as good as the assets in the pension scheme supporting it .
pension changes can be very controversial these government changes , introduced in good faith , have , as so often , had the equal and opposite effect to the intentions of the government .
instead of making pensions more secure they have had the effect of reducing the overall pension coverage .
at the same time employers have become less paternalistic towards their employees .
they are happier now to put in place defined contribution pension arrangements .
in these , the employee , rather than the employer , carries all the investment and longevity risks associated with planning for retirement .
against this background , do these pension buyouts really make any difference to the members of the schemes ?
does it matter that the people standing behind the pension promise are us bankers rather than the uk employer ?
on the whole the answer to this is probably not .
a winning situation ?
a uk employer may be a good company who understands how to manufacture widgets , operate gambling facilities , or whatever , and that is where the management 's attention probably should be focused .
one side wants to get rid of the risk whilst the other side is prepared to take it on pension buy-outs gather pace but there are significant risks associated with running a defined benefit pension scheme and the management team needs to be fully familiar with those risks .
to this end it probably makes sense to transfer the pension scheme to a management team that is dedicated to controlling those risks .
this is the reason that these deals happen - one side wants to get rid of the risk whilst the other side is prepared to take it on .
the company selling the risk -lrb- rank last week -rrb- places a high value on that risk because it does not like it .
the company that buys the risk places a lower value on it because it understands the risks that it is taking on .
consequently , any price set between these two values will be a win / win situation for the two companies .
risks does this mean that there is any less security for the member ?
what if something goes wrong - the new managers make a hash of the investments or we all live for much longer than was previously expected ?
again , the answer here is that there is probably no greater risk than there was before .
the trustees of the pension scheme need to ensure that the pensions regulator is fully informed as to the intended transaction .
one of his main interests will be to ensure that the new backer is at least as strong as the transferring company .
furthermore , as explained above , the new backers will understand pension risks better and should , theoretically , make fewer mistakes in the operation of the pension scheme .
changes of course , two things do change .
members of uk pension schemes know that if the pension scheme has insufficient assets they can turn to the uk employer to make good those assets marconi pensions ' threat ' blocked the first is that the new pension scheme owners will not allow members to earn any further benefit .
in other words , the employees of the transferring company will need to earn future pension benefits through another pension scheme -lrb- probably a defined contribution one -rrb- .
secondly , the new owners will not provide any benefits that may have been provided on a discretionary basis .
the rules of most uk pension schemes set out the " guaranteed " level of benefits and then specify that the trustees and the employer between them might agree to provide additional benefits in certain circumstances .
it is extremely unlikely that any such discretionary benefits will be provided in the future .
finally , members of uk pension schemes know that if the pension scheme has insufficient assets they can turn to the uk employer to make good those assets .
safety net if the employer can not fund a scheme properly , then the pension scheme is likely to be eligible to go into the pension protection fund -lrb- ppf -rrb- .
that way members will get compensation at a lower level than the pension benefits they expected , but even so they will not be penniless .
the new owners of uk pension schemes may be employers themselves , stepping into the shoes of the old employer .
in this case members will be equally entitled to compensation in the event that the new owner goes bust .
or they may be set up as insurance companies in which case members should be entitled to cover , under the policyholders ' protection act .
this provides less than full compensation but at a comparable type of level to the ppf .
so , to answer my question above as to whether members should be concerned , i do not think so .
it would be easy to get emotive , but the chances are that it is all rather too late because most employers no longer have a paternalistic view of their employees when it comes to pension provision .

it is extremely unlikely that any such discretionary benefits will be provided in the future .
finally , members of uk pension schemes know that if the pension scheme has insufficient assets they can turn to the uk employer to make good those assets .
safety net if the employer can not fund a scheme properly , then the pension scheme is likely to be eligible to go into the pension protection fund -lrb- ppf -rrb- .
that way members will get compensation at a lower level than the pension benefits they expected , but even so they will not be penniless .
the new owners of uk pension schemes may be employers themselves , stepping into the shoes of the old employer .
in this case members will be equally entitled to compensation in the event that the new owner goes bust .
or they may be set up as insurance companies in which case members should be entitled to cover , under the policyholders ' protection act .
this provides less than full compensation but at a comparable type of level to the ppf .
so , to answer my question above as to whether members should be concerned , i do not think so .
it would be easy to get emotive , but the chances are that it is all rather too late because most employers no longer have a paternalistic view of their employees when it comes to pension provision .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- are pension sell-offs a good thing ?
bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies 07:52 gmt , thursday , 6 march 2008 are pension sell-offs a good thing ?
money talk by nick salter barnett waddingham actuaries " the recent decision by rank to sell its pension scheme was the latest in a small but growing number of such deals .
the rank fund , with all its assets and liabilities , was sold to rothesay life , which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of goldman sachs .
other companies are expected to do the same and sell their pension schemes to entities set up specifically for the purpose .
whilst this may well be good for rank and , indeed , for goldman sachs , what impact does it really have on the members of the pension scheme ?
secure retirement in the uk , defined benefit pension schemes were traditionally set up by employers who wanted to ensure that their employees were able to earn a pension that would allow them to retire with sufficient income to maintain their standard of living . "
employers have become less paternalistic towards their employees " rank sell its pension scheme this was , somewhat arbitrarily , often set at two-thirds of the income that a member received whilst working .
the idea was that maybe one-third of one 's income whilst working was spent undertaking the job itself - buying work clothing , commuting to work and so on .
employers set these schemes up voluntarily and created pensions trusts to hold the assets against the promises made .
the voluntary nature of the promise has come under fire from successive governments .
the effect of this is that virtually no employers are setting up defined benefit , or final salary , pension schemes for their staff any longer .
that is because there is now an obligation that , if you do set up a scheme , the members have to be paid their benefits whatever the financial situation of the employer .
paternalism disappears historically , the promise was only as good as the assets in the pension scheme supporting it .
these government changes , introduced in good faith , have , as so often , had the equal and opposite effect to the intentions of the government .
instead of making pensions more secure they have had the effect of reducing the overall pension coverage .
at the same time employers have become less paternalistic towards their employees .
they are happier now to put in place defined contribution pension arrangements .
in these , the employee , rather than the employer , carries all the investment and longevity risks associated with planning for retirement .
against this background , do these pension buyouts really make any difference to the members of the schemes ?
does it matter that the people standing behind the pension promise are us bankers rather than the uk employer ?
on the whole the answer to this is probably not .
a winning situation ?
a uk employer may be a good company who understands how to manufacture widgets , operate gambling facilities , or whatever , and that is where the management 's attention probably should be focused . "
one side wants to get rid of the risk whilst the other side is prepared to take it on " pension buy-outs gather pace but there are significant risks associated with running a defined benefit pension scheme and the management team needs to be fully familiar with those risks .
to this end it probably makes sense to transfer the pension scheme to a management team that is dedicated to controlling those risks .
this is the reason that these deals happen - one side wants to get rid of the risk whilst the other side is prepared to take it on .
the company selling the risk -lrb- rank last week -rrb- places a high value on that risk because it does not like it .
the company that buys the risk places a lower value on it because it understands the risks that it is taking on .
consequently , any price set between these two values will be a win / win situation for the two companies .
risks does this mean that there is any less security for the member ?
what if something goes wrong - the new managers make a hash of the investments or we all live for much longer than was previously expected ?
again , the answer here is that there is probably no greater risk than there was before .
the trustees of the pension scheme need to ensure that the pensions regulator is fully informed as to the intended transaction .
one of his main interests will be to ensure that the new backer is at least as strong as the transferring company .
furthermore , as explained above , the new backers will understand pension risks better and should , theoretically , make fewer mistakes in the operation of the pension scheme .
changes of course , two things do change . "
members of uk pension schemes know that if the pension scheme has insufficient assets they can turn to the uk employer to make good those assets " marconi pensions ' threat ' blocked the first is that the new pension scheme owners will not allow members to earn any further benefit .
in other words , the employees of the transferring company will need to earn future pension benefits through another pension scheme -lrb- probably a defined contribution one -rrb- .
secondly , the new owners will not provide any benefits that may have been provided on a discretionary basis .
the rules of most uk pension schemes set out the " guaranteed " level of benefits and then specify that the trustees and the employer between them might agree to provide additional benefits in certain circumstances .
it is extremely unlikely that any such discretionary benefits will be provided in the future .
finally , members of uk pension schemes know that if the pension scheme has insufficient assets they can turn to the uk employer to make good those assets .
safety net if the employer can not fund a scheme properly , then the pension scheme is likely to be eligible to go into the pension protection fund -lrb- ppf -rrb- .
that way members will get compensation at a lower level than the pension benefits they expected , but even so they will not be penniless .
the new owners of uk pension schemes may be employers themselves , stepping into the shoes of the old employer .
in this case members will be equally entitled to compensation in the event that the new owner goes bust .
or they may be set up as insurance companies in which case members should be entitled to cover , under the policyholders ' protection act .
this provides less than full compensation but at a comparable type of level to the ppf .
so , to answer my question above as to whether members should be concerned , i do not think so .
it would be easy to get emotive , but the chances are that it is all rather too late because most employers no longer have a paternalistic view of their employees when it comes to pension provision . "

the average increase across wales next year will be 3.75 % - just under the previous record of 3.8 % seen in 2005/6 .
it means the average band d household in wales will have to pay £ 871 a year in basic council tax .
the highest increases are in conwy and ceredigion - both 5 % - and the lowest is in anglesey , which is 1.5 % .
this compares to a reported increase of 3.9 % in council tax in england , with the average english band d bill estimated by the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy -lrb- cipfa -rrb- to be £ 1,373 .
a handful of wales ' 22 local authorities are yet to confirm their new council tax levels for 2008/9 , but every council will have voted on the final level of increases by the end of friday afternoon .

on top of the basic council tax , householders will have to make separate payments for local police services and community / town councils .
the low increases come despite fears for high rises following a below inflation settlement from the welsh assembly government .
they also come ahead of the elections for every local authority in wales on 1 may .
the welsh local government association -lrb- wlga -rrb- said councils had worked " vigorously " to ensure council tax was kept low while not cutting services .
but it called for more resources in the future .
newport councillor bill langsford , wlga 's finance spokesperson , said : " again at this early stage we call on the welsh assembly government to rethink its budget assumptions over the next three years and place real emphasis on closing the funding gap between schools in wales and england and prioritise our social services . "
gareth winston roberts , leader of anglesey council , said the authority was able to set the country 's lowest council tax increase without dipping into its reserves .
" the executive managed to keep the council tax increase to a minimum as we were prudent enough to have prepared ourselves for a bad settlement and had lined up a number of budget savings during the past year , " he said .
local government minister dr brian gibbons said he was " encouraged " by the " prudent " council tax increases .
he said : " the welsh assembly government has provided a fair settlement to local authorities in wales in a challenging period for public sector finances and i have maintained that i would not expect the council tax increase in any welsh local authority to exceed 5 % in the coming year . "

but neither are included among the names on the war memorial in penarth in the vale of glamorgan .
the town council is to honour them 90 years on with a special plaque .

sgt samuel pearse and capt richard wain were awarded britain 's highest gallantry medal for their actions in the conflict which claimed their lives .
but neither are included among the names on the war memorial in penarth in the vale of glamorgan .
the town council is to honour them 90 years on with a special plaque .
military historian paul kiley has carried out research into the stories of the two penarth vc holders who are among only 20 from wales - and 1355 in total - to receive the honour launched in 1856 by queen victoria .
sgt pearse died after wwi had ended in august 1919 when he was volunteering with the 45th battalion of the royal fusiliers at emtsa in northern russia .
mr kiley explained : " samuel pearse was born and bred in penarth emigrated to australia in 1911 , was at gallipoli , the battle of the somme .
the victoria cross is britain 's highest award for gallantry " he survived all that , he won the military medal , and then he was posted off to north russia at the end of the war where he won his vc posthumously . "
capt wain , meanwhile , was killed at cambrai in france on 20 november 1917 , while serving with the royal tank corps .
" richard wain took on a german enemy position single handed after his tank was hit .
his crew were killed , he was mortally wounded .

wing commander guy gibson , leader of the dambuster raid in wwii , married a local girl and lived in the town for a while .
richard james from the royal british legion explained : " we 've considered our only vc holder was guy gibson the dambusters hero , who was a very famous man of course .
guy gibson , also a vc holder , has links to the town " so it 's come as a tremendous surprise and it 's very very nice to know that we have heroes going further back . "

it comes after the drugs regulator announced glaxosmithkline would not face criminal proceedings over claims it withheld information on seroxat .
but they warned gsk should have been quicker to raise the alarm on the risk of suicidal behaviour associated with the antidepressant in the under-18s .
gsk has rejected claims it improperly withheld drug-trial information .
the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency -lrb- mhra -rrb- received data from clinical trials in may 2003 showing that patients under 18 had a higher risk of suicidal behaviour if they were treated with seroxat than if they received a placebo . "
we will take immediate steps to ensure the law is strengthened further , so that there can be no doubt as to companies ' obligations to report safety issues " professor kent woods , mhra q & a : seroxat data data also showed that seroxat was not effective for treating depression in children and adolescents .
the drug was subsequently banned for use in under 18s .
' responsibility ' but professor kent woods , mhra chief executive said they were disappointed gsk had not given them information earlier and that drugs firms had an " ethical responsibility " .
" i remain concerned that gsk could and should have reported this information earlier than they did .
" all companies have a responsibility to patients , and should report any adverse data signals to us as soon as they discover them .
" this investigation has revealed important weaknesses in the drug safety legislation in force at the time . "
he said subsequent legislation has partially addressed the problem but more still needed to be done .
the mhra spent four years looking at over one million pages of evidence to determine whether gsk had withheld information .
they concluded there was no realistic prospect of a conviction as legislation in place at the time was not sufficient to require companies to inform the regulator of safety information when the drug was being used for , or tested outside its licensed indications .
in common with many drugs , seroxat was never licensed for the under 18s , but doctors could still prescribe it .
a bbc panorama investigation last year reported that secret e-mails showed the drug company distorted trial results , covering up a link with suicide in teenagers .
the internal documents suggested gsk knew there was a problem with the effectiveness of seroxat in children five years before the drug was banned .
health minister dawn primarolo said the government would take immediate steps to secure a strengthening of the law in the uk and europe .
she also said they wanted to make it clear to all pharmaceutical companies that , " notwithstanding the limitations that may exist in the law , they should disclose any information they have that would have a bearing on the protection of health " .
dr alastair benbow , medical director for gsk europe said : " we firmly believe we acted properly and responsibly in first carrying out this important clinical trials programme and then informing the regulatory agencies when we identified a potential increased risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in patients under 18 .
" gsk is committed to working with the government , appropriate regulatory authorities and other pharmaceutical companies to take whatever action is necessary to improve legislation and policy in this area . "
andrew mcculloch , chief executive of the mental health foundation said it was " totally unacceptable " to hear that young people may have taken their own lives due to a lack of transparency by a pharmaceutical company .

it comes after the drugs regulator announced glaxosmithkline would not face criminal proceedings over claims it withheld information on seroxat .
but they warned gsk should have been quicker to raise the alarm on the risk of suicidal behaviour associated with the antidepressant in the under-18s .
gsk has rejected claims it improperly withheld drug-trial information .
the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency -lrb- mhra -rrb- received data from clinical trials in may 2003 showing that patients under 18 had a higher risk of suicidal behaviour if they were treated with seroxat than if they received a placebo .
we will take immediate steps to ensure the law is strengthened further , so that there can be no doubt as to companies ' obligations to report safety issues professor kent woods , mhra q & a : seroxat data data also showed that seroxat was not effective for treating depression in children and adolescents .
the drug was subsequently banned for use in under 18s .
' responsibility ' but professor kent woods , mhra chief executive said they were disappointed gsk had not given them information earlier and that drugs firms had an " ethical responsibility " .
" i remain concerned that gsk could and should have reported this information earlier than they did .
" all companies have a responsibility to patients , and should report any adverse data signals to us as soon as they discover them .
" this investigation has revealed important weaknesses in the drug safety legislation in force at the time . "
he said subsequent legislation has partially addressed the problem but more still needed to be done .
the mhra spent four years looking at over one million pages of evidence to determine whether gsk had withheld information .
they concluded there was no realistic prospect of a conviction as legislation in place at the time was not sufficient to require companies to inform the regulator of safety information when the drug was being used for , or tested outside its licensed indications .
in common with many drugs , seroxat was never licensed for the under 18s , but doctors could still prescribe it .
a bbc panorama investigation last year reported that secret e-mails showed the drug company distorted trial results , covering up a link with suicide in teenagers .
the internal documents suggested gsk knew there was a problem with the effectiveness of seroxat in children five years before the drug was banned .
health minister dawn primarolo said the government would take immediate steps to secure a strengthening of the law in the uk and europe .
she also said they wanted to make it clear to all pharmaceutical companies that , " notwithstanding the limitations that may exist in the law , they should disclose any information they have that would have a bearing on the protection of health " .
dr alastair benbow , medical director for gsk europe said : " we firmly believe we acted properly and responsibly in first carrying out this important clinical trials programme and then informing the regulatory agencies when we identified a potential increased risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in patients under 18 .
" gsk is committed to working with the government , appropriate regulatory authorities and other pharmaceutical companies to take whatever action is necessary to improve legislation and policy in this area . "
andrew mcculloch , chief executive of the mental health foundation said it was " totally unacceptable " to hear that young people may have taken their own lives due to a lack of transparency by a pharmaceutical company .
