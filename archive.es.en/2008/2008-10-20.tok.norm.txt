" the blast took place on a main road .
this is the work of terrorists .
we have arrested two suspects in relation to the incident , " he said . two other children who were playing nearby and two german soldiers were also wounded , provincial governor mohammad omar said . the governor said the attacker on a bicycle blew himself up next to a german army convoy in the chardara district , five kilometers south of kunduz city . the taliban took responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its website , saying one of its fighters , identified only as islamuddin , carried out the attack . a spokesman for the hard-line taliban , zabihullah mujahid , claimed a dozen foreign soldiers had been killed . nato , germany confirm deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin confirmed the attack had targeted the bundeswehr the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- also confirmed the deaths of two of its soldiers in a statement issued by its headquarters in kabul . " acts such as this , which offer nothing but violence and death , will not deter us in our commitment to create a better afghanistan , " brigadier general richard blanchette , an isaf spokesman said . the isaf commander did not give the nationalities of the dead troops but the german defense ministry , which approved the deployment of an additional 1,000 german troops to afghanistan last week , confirmed monday 's bombing as taking place near to where its troops were based , just outside of kunduz . provincial governor omar said the two troops killed were german . taliban militants have recently heavily relied on suicide and roadside bombings as part of their campaign against the western-backed afghan government and international forces . " we have information that five bombers have entered into the province , " omar added , raising concerns that the region would be plagued by more assaults in the future . northern afghanistan is relatively peaceful compared with the south and east , where taliban militants are the most active . bundeswehr deployment one of the largest in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troops are increasingly at risk from attack more than 3,500 german soldiers are stationed in the northern provinces .
the soldiers are part of around 50,000 isaf troops that have been deployed to the country after the 2001 ouster of the taliban regime . germany has one of the biggest contingents in isaf , based largely in the northern towns of mazar-i-sharif and kunduz . another german soldier was killed in the same district at the end of august in a roadside bombing .
the taliban claimed responsibility for that blast . it was the second suicide attack in afghanistan on monday after another bomber blew himself up against an armored afghan army vehicle in the southern town of lashkar gah but killed only himself .
the attacker , who detonated bombs strapped to his body , appeared to be around 15 years old , afghan army officer gul noor said .
the vehicle was badly damaged . the taliban have attacked lashkar gah , the capital of volatile helmand province , several times in the past week but have been repelled in battles that afghan authorities said had left several rebel fighters dead . increase of suicide bombings as insurgency swells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings have increased as the taliban push on afghanistan has seen a spate of suicide attacks , which are most usually aimed at international forces but kill more civilians . most of the attacks are claimed by the taliban , the islamist extremist movement which has been waging an insurgency in afghanistan . the group was in government between 1996 and 2001 when they were toppled in a us-led invasion after refusing to hand over al-qaeda militants blamed for the 9/11 attacks on the united states . they are fighting to take back control in an insurgency that has grown year on year . nato has about 50,000 soldiers from nearly 40 countries in afghanistan helping the government to assert its authority . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .

this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .

" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .

soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '

' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .
all in all , hecht counts himself lucky not to have been affected by a financial crisis which has reeked havoc across a plethora of industries throughout nations developed and developing . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am , of course , not prophesying that far-right extremists grab power like they did on january 30 , 1933 , " political scientist christoph butterwegge told german news agency dpa .
" but it is striking how similar the cycles are . " the bankruptcy of financial institutions and plunging stock markets set off a global economic crisis that led to mass unemployment in germany that the national socialist german workers party took advantage of for its growth . some economists have said they fear increased unemployment in germany could also be an effect of the current global financial crisis . unemployment fertile ground for extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies are mixed on the connection between far-right parties and unemployment the international labor organization warned on monday , oct .
20 , that the credit crisis could cost 20 million jobs their jobs .
while thousands have already been laid off in the world 's financial centers , ilo head juan somavia said ordinary working people could feel the brunt of the lay-offs . " this is not simply a crisis on wall street , this is a crisis on all streets .
we need an economic rescue plan for working families and the real economy , with rules and policies that deliver decent jobs , " he said . higher unemployment typically leads to an increased acceptance of far-right parties , butterwegge said . " the competition for resources will get much stronger when the state spends even a fraction of the 480 billion euros in the financial injections and guarantees , " he said , adding that feelings of social injustice could mainly benefit parties that call for authoritarian forms of government . a study presented this summer by the friedrich ebert foundation found 37 percent of the german population said immigrants come to germany " to exploit the welfare state , " 39 percent think germany " is dangerously over-run with foreigners , " and 26 percent would like " a single , strong party that represents the german community .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .

stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .

irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .
topolanek , whose governing party has a significant eurosceptic streak , called the treaty " a very tough compromise " and the price for belonging to " a certain orbit of civilization . "
" that is why i support it despite all the problems i have with it , " he said .

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .

the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 20.10.2008 cultural sponsoring untouched by financial crisis woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank , whose art is on loan at staedel museum , is a big corporate patron german funding for the arts comes mainly from public spending , unlike the united states , where wall street 's woes cut into wealthy patrons ' pockets .
but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .

" this country is in motion , both culturally and politically , " book fair director juergen boos said . turkey had made full use of the opportunities that " appearing on the greatest literary world stage has to offer , " boos said . more than the " well-known problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last visitors left the book fair on sunday , oct .
19 the turkish organizing committee was visibly anxious to exclude all political elements from its events . " the name turkey should evoke more than just the well-known usual problems , " istanbul publisher muge gorsoy sokmen said . many of the freedom of expression issues other nations have with turkey deal with a section of turkish penal code that makes it a crime to " denigrate turknishness " and threatens violators with up to three years in prison . but sokmen said it was important for her that turkish writers were perceived " simply as artists " and not as " mouthpieces for the government or dissidents . " turkish politics in three acts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish literature was in high demand in frankfurt the contradictions of turkish life and the political problems in which the country is embroiled were acted out during the five-day book fair . pamuk entered the stage for the first act at the beginning of the fair with a soliloquy in which he said , " the propensity of the turkish state to ban books and punish writers is unfortunately continuing . " president abdullah gul commanded the second act when turkish journalists asked him shortly before he left for frankfurt to react to pamuk 's comments and to " negative reports " in the german press . the questions allowed gul to portray himself as a defender of criticism and turkey as a land of free speech by saying there was no book that could not be published and " equally extreme views " would be expressed . " turkey is not a country of prohibitions , " he added . turkish publishers took charge of the third act , like children who had been burnt , but were still unafraid of fire . they spoke of the state 's and the military 's paternalism and said that not much had changed . more changes needed as long as this " authoritarian mentality " remained , freedom of expression would remain limited , etyen mahcupyan of the armenian-turkish weekly agos said . there would be no freedom of expression without a fundamental change in mentality , publisher ragip zarakolu said . in order to achieve this , he said " much more radical changes " were needed " than have happened so far . " for its part , amnesty international said the book fair could have a lasting , positive effect on the condition of human rights in turkey even if the improvements were n't immediately visable . " it does n't change the situation in turkey yet , of course , but it is a step on the path towards breaking taboos , " amnesty 's turkey expert amke dietert told german news agency dpa .

" the blast took place on a main road .
this is the work of terrorists .
we have arrested two suspects in relation to the incident , " he said . two other children who were playing nearby and two german soldiers were also wounded , provincial governor mohammad omar said . the governor said the attacker on a bicycle blew himself up next to a german army convoy in the chardara district , five kilometers south of kunduz city . the taliban took responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its website , saying one of its fighters , identified only as islamuddin , carried out the attack . a spokesman for the hard-line taliban , zabihullah mujahid , claimed a dozen foreign soldiers had been killed . nato , germany confirm deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin confirmed the attack had targeted the bundeswehr the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- also confirmed the deaths of two of its soldiers in a statement issued by its headquarters in kabul . " acts such as this , which offer nothing but violence and death , will not deter us in our commitment to create a better afghanistan , " brigadier general richard blanchette , an isaf spokesman said . the isaf commander did not give the nationalities of the dead troops but the german defense ministry , which approved the deployment of an additional 1,000 german troops to afghanistan last week , confirmed monday 's bombing as taking place near to where its troops were based , just outside of kunduz . provincial governor omar said the two troops killed were german . taliban militants have recently heavily relied on suicide and roadside bombings as part of their campaign against the western-backed afghan government and international forces . " we have information that five bombers have entered into the province , " omar added , raising concerns that the region would be plagued by more assaults in the future . northern afghanistan is relatively peaceful compared with the south and east , where taliban militants are the most active . bundeswehr deployment one of the largest in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troops are increasingly at risk from attack more than 3,500 german soldiers are stationed in the northern provinces .
the soldiers are part of around 50,000 isaf troops that have been deployed to the country after the 2001 ouster of the taliban regime . germany has one of the biggest contingents in isaf , based largely in the northern towns of mazar-i-sharif and kunduz . another german soldier was killed in the same district at the end of august in a roadside bombing .
the taliban claimed responsibility for that blast . it was the second suicide attack in afghanistan on monday after another bomber blew himself up against an armored afghan army vehicle in the southern town of lashkar gah but killed only himself .
the attacker , who detonated bombs strapped to his body , appeared to be around 15 years old , afghan army officer gul noor said .
the vehicle was badly damaged . the taliban have attacked lashkar gah , the capital of volatile helmand province , several times in the past week but have been repelled in battles that afghan authorities said had left several rebel fighters dead . increase of suicide bombings as insurgency swells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings have increased as the taliban push on afghanistan has seen a spate of suicide attacks , which are most usually aimed at international forces but kill more civilians . most of the attacks are claimed by the taliban , the islamist extremist movement which has been waging an insurgency in afghanistan . the group was in government between 1996 and 2001 when they were toppled in a us-led invasion after refusing to hand over al-qaeda militants blamed for the 9/11 attacks on the united states . they are fighting to take back control in an insurgency that has grown year on year . nato has about 50,000 soldiers from nearly 40 countries in afghanistan helping the government to assert its authority . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.10.2008 mad world of sports still calm amid financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passion for sport seems not to have been dimmed by the financial crisis with banks battling to survive , markets seeing takeover bids and company chiefs facing penalities for poor performance , it seems commerce chambers are beating sports pitches and locker rooms for sheer drama these days . the world of sports - as yet - appears remarkably unaffected by the global market crisis .
this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .
all in all , hecht counts himself lucky not to have been affected by a financial crisis which has reeked havoc across a plethora of industries throughout nations developed and developing . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 . the conditions include capping the maximum capital injection which each bank may receive at 10 billion euros , a finance ministry spokesman said . executive salaries at banks that get help will be capped at 500,000 euros , although exceptions are possible . those managers would also be forced to give up bonuses and dividend payments during the period their banks were indebted to the state . the government is also planning to exercise influence over the business strategy of financial houses that have been hit by the crisis , which is likely to result in banks steering away from risky investments . up to 400 billion euro from the package is earmarked for lending guarantees for banks , with the remaining 80 billion going towards recapitalizing institutions and , if necessary , purchasing risky assets . in announcing the conditions for the bailout package , the government also made a stern appeal to shaky german financial institutions to take up its offer . banks ' responses mixed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann said he would be ashamed if deutsche bank accepted government funds but the heads of a collection of germany 's largest commercial banks said they would not immediately seek a portion of the funds under the current terms . deutsche bank chief josef ackermann said saturday his bank did not require a cash injection from the bailout package . ackermann said that " at no point " had deutsche bank been in danger during the financial crisis . " i would be ashamed if we were to take state money during this crisis , " he said . ackermann 's comments ruffled officials ' feathers , however , with government spokesman thomas steg saying the deutsche bank chief 's words aroused ire at a meeting of the german cabinet on monday . steg labelled the comments " totally incomprehensible " and " objectionable . " bavarian bank a likely taker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayernlb has accepted the government 's conditions on its bailout plan going against the grain though is bavarian state bank bayernlb , which said it would likely seek money from the package as soon as possible . erwin huber , the bank 's administrative board chief and bavarian finance minister , told the zdf-morgenmagazin television program on monday that the funds are being sought to achieve " a fast stabilization .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .

stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .

automakers are among those who may be able to look forward to state support . berlin plans " targeted measures " to boost the german economy but aims to avoid a nationwide stimulus package , government spokesman thomas steg said monday , oct .

" the chancellor spoke out -lrb- at the cabinet meeting -rrb- specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg said at a press conference .
" what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries . " steg added the measures would have to be " convincing , affordable and , first and foremost , able to be put into place quickly . " the cabinet will then decide which measures are appropriate while drafting up its 2009 budget , which is due to be finalized next month , steg said . automakers could see aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car industry has said the state needs to take action in tough economic times media reports said on monday that the measures being considered included tax breaks for low-emissions cars and state guarantees on loans to small and medium sized companies .
steg said no specific measures were discussed by the cabinet on monday but added that carmakers would receive close attention . " from the chancellor 's point of view , the automobile industry is a very important branch because it still has a superior position in terms of employment , " steg said . the industry has also requested state support . " the uncertainty of consumers has been increased by the financial crisis , " said eckehart rotter , a spokesman for the german automobile association -lrb- vda -rrb- .
" something has to be done to work against that and strengthen consumers ' confidence .

" there 's a bumpy road ahead of us , " he said at a meeting of the spd , which governs in a grand coalition with merkel 's christian democratic union , " after the rescue shield for the banks , we need a protective shield for jobs .
the job 's not done with the financial rescue .
the crisis will hit the economy .
how hard and for how long depends on us . " economy languishing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said a german recession is likely the moves came ahead of an announcement on monday from the german central bank that europe 's largest economy had likely stagnated in the third quarter of 2008 . in the second quarter of 2008 , german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank by 0.5 percent on a quarterly basis and a number of economists had been forecasting a further drop in the third quarter . the technical definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth . german economy minister michael glos last week cut his 2009 growth outlook to just 0.2 percent , a fraction of the previous forecast of 1.2 percent . other economic institutions , however , were more pessimistic .

" this country is in motion , both culturally and politically , " book fair director juergen boos said . turkey had made full use of the opportunities that " appearing on the greatest literary world stage has to offer , " boos said . more than the " well-known problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last visitors left the book fair on sunday , oct .
19 the turkish organizing committee was visibly anxious to exclude all political elements from its events . " the name turkey should evoke more than just the well-known usual problems , " istanbul publisher muge gorsoy sokmen said . many of the freedom of expression issues other nations have with turkey deal with a section of turkish penal code that makes it a crime to " denigrate turknishness " and threatens violators with up to three years in prison . but sokmen said it was important for her that turkish writers were perceived " simply as artists " and not as " mouthpieces for the government or dissidents . " turkish politics in three acts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish literature was in high demand in frankfurt the contradictions of turkish life and the political problems in which the country is embroiled were acted out during the five-day book fair . pamuk entered the stage for the first act at the beginning of the fair with a soliloquy in which he said , " the propensity of the turkish state to ban books and punish writers is unfortunately continuing . " president abdullah gul commanded the second act when turkish journalists asked him shortly before he left for frankfurt to react to pamuk 's comments and to " negative reports " in the german press . the questions allowed gul to portray himself as a defender of criticism and turkey as a land of free speech by saying there was no book that could not be published and " equally extreme views " would be expressed . " turkey is not a country of prohibitions , " he added . turkish publishers took charge of the third act , like children who had been burnt , but were still unafraid of fire . they spoke of the state 's and the military 's paternalism and said that not much had changed . more changes needed as long as this " authoritarian mentality " remained , freedom of expression would remain limited , etyen mahcupyan of the armenian-turkish weekly agos said . there would be no freedom of expression without a fundamental change in mentality , publisher ragip zarakolu said . in order to achieve this , he said " much more radical changes " were needed " than have happened so far . " for its part , amnesty international said the book fair could have a lasting , positive effect on the condition of human rights in turkey even if the improvements were n't immediately visable . " it does n't change the situation in turkey yet , of course , but it is a step on the path towards breaking taboos , " amnesty 's turkey expert amke dietert told german news agency dpa .

" i am , of course , not prophesying that far-right extremists grab power like they did on january 30 , 1933 , " political scientist christoph butterwegge told german news agency dpa .
" but it is striking how similar the cycles are . " the bankruptcy of financial institutions and plunging stock markets set off a global economic crisis that led to mass unemployment in germany that the national socialist german workers party took advantage of for its growth . some economists have said they fear increased unemployment in germany could also be an effect of the current global financial crisis . unemployment fertile ground for extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies are mixed on the connection between far-right parties and unemployment the international labor organization warned on monday , oct .
20 , that the credit crisis could cost 20 million jobs their jobs .
while thousands have already been laid off in the world 's financial centers , ilo head juan somavia said ordinary working people could feel the brunt of the lay-offs . " this is not simply a crisis on wall street , this is a crisis on all streets .
we need an economic rescue plan for working families and the real economy , with rules and policies that deliver decent jobs , " he said . higher unemployment typically leads to an increased acceptance of far-right parties , butterwegge said . " the competition for resources will get much stronger when the state spends even a fraction of the 480 billion euros in the financial injections and guarantees , " he said , adding that feelings of social injustice could mainly benefit parties that call for authoritarian forms of government . a study presented this summer by the friedrich ebert foundation found 37 percent of the german population said immigrants come to germany " to exploit the welfare state , " 39 percent think germany " is dangerously over-run with foreigners , " and 26 percent would like " a single , strong party that represents the german community . " the report found most of the participants said they felt powerless to help define politics , the study also revealed a widespread disillusionment with democracy and democratic principles . far-right parties are present in two german state governments but are not represented at the federal level .
the far-right national democratic party has also called for nationalizing banks in the wake of the financial crisis . germany 's main parties also lost some of their trustworthiness in some people 's eyes after they all approved the massive bank rescue package a short time after saying there was no money to increase social spending , butterwegge said . " the far-right extremists know how to use that to their advantage , " he added .

" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .
all in all , hecht counts himself lucky not to have been affected by a financial crisis which has reeked havoc across a plethora of industries throughout nations developed and developing . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .

" what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries .

" from the chancellor 's point of view , the automobile industry is a very important branch because it still has a superior position in terms of employment , " steg said . the industry has also requested state support .

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .
" the financial crisis does not stop climate change , " he said .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the financial crisis was being used as an excuse by states afraid of the economic consequences of bridling carbon emissions .
" if we do n't make it -lrb- to agreement by december -rrb- , the international negotiations on climate change are going to be seriously compromised , " he said .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas chimed in , referring to the eu plan as " the red line . "
he said any adjustments to the plan would have to avoid " touching the environmental objective . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this country is in motion , both culturally and politically , " book fair director juergen boos said . turkey had made full use of the opportunities that " appearing on the greatest literary world stage has to offer , " boos said . more than the " well-known problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last visitors left the book fair on sunday , oct .
19 the turkish organizing committee was visibly anxious to exclude all political elements from its events . " the name turkey should evoke more than just the well-known usual problems , " istanbul publisher muge gorsoy sokmen said . many of the freedom of expression issues other nations have with turkey deal with a section of turkish penal code that makes it a crime to " denigrate turknishness " and threatens violators with up to three years in prison . but sokmen said it was important for her that turkish writers were perceived " simply as artists " and not as " mouthpieces for the government or dissidents . " turkish politics in three acts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish literature was in high demand in frankfurt the contradictions of turkish life and the political problems in which the country is embroiled were acted out during the five-day book fair . pamuk entered the stage for the first act at the beginning of the fair with a soliloquy in which he said , " the propensity of the turkish state to ban books and punish writers is unfortunately continuing . " president abdullah gul commanded the second act when turkish journalists asked him shortly before he left for frankfurt to react to pamuk 's comments and to " negative reports " in the german press . the questions allowed gul to portray himself as a defender of criticism and turkey as a land of free speech by saying there was no book that could not be published and " equally extreme views " would be expressed . " turkey is not a country of prohibitions , " he added . turkish publishers took charge of the third act , like children who had been burnt , but were still unafraid of fire . they spoke of the state 's and the military 's paternalism and said that not much had changed . more changes needed as long as this " authoritarian mentality " remained , freedom of expression would remain limited , etyen mahcupyan of the armenian-turkish weekly agos said . there would be no freedom of expression without a fundamental change in mentality , publisher ragip zarakolu said . in order to achieve this , he said " much more radical changes " were needed " than have happened so far . " for its part , amnesty international said the book fair could have a lasting , positive effect on the condition of human rights in turkey even if the improvements were n't immediately visable . " it does n't change the situation in turkey yet , of course , but it is a step on the path towards breaking taboos , " amnesty 's turkey expert amke dietert told german news agency dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 20.10.2008 eu climate plan sees strong opposition from member states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has expressed strong opposition to eu plans to cut carbon emissions by 2020 eu environment ministers pledged monday to honour ambitious carbon emission reduction targets for the bloc , despite fears industry could be severely impaired in light of the global financial crisis . but some eu states expressed deep opposition to the plan at the eu environment talks in luxembourg , fearing a loss of billions of euros and the weakening of their economies .
in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .
" the financial crisis does not stop climate change , " he said .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the financial crisis was being used as an excuse by states afraid of the economic consequences of bridling carbon emissions .
" if we do n't make it -lrb- to agreement by december -rrb- , the international negotiations on climate change are going to be seriously compromised , " he said .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas chimed in , referring to the eu plan as " the red line . "
he said any adjustments to the plan would have to avoid " touching the environmental objective . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .

" i am , of course , not prophesying that far-right extremists grab power like they did on january 30 , 1933 , " political scientist christoph butterwegge told german news agency dpa .
" but it is striking how similar the cycles are . " the bankruptcy of financial institutions and plunging stock markets set off a global economic crisis that led to mass unemployment in germany that the national socialist german workers party took advantage of for its growth . some economists have said they fear increased unemployment in germany could also be an effect of the current global financial crisis . unemployment fertile ground for extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies are mixed on the connection between far-right parties and unemployment the international labor organization warned on monday , oct .
20 , that the credit crisis could cost 20 million jobs their jobs .
while thousands have already been laid off in the world 's financial centers , ilo head juan somavia said ordinary working people could feel the brunt of the lay-offs . " this is not simply a crisis on wall street , this is a crisis on all streets .
we need an economic rescue plan for working families and the real economy , with rules and policies that deliver decent jobs , " he said . higher unemployment typically leads to an increased acceptance of far-right parties , butterwegge said . " the competition for resources will get much stronger when the state spends even a fraction of the 480 billion euros in the financial injections and guarantees , " he said , adding that feelings of social injustice could mainly benefit parties that call for authoritarian forms of government . a study presented this summer by the friedrich ebert foundation found 37 percent of the german population said immigrants come to germany " to exploit the welfare state , " 39 percent think germany " is dangerously over-run with foreigners , " and 26 percent would like " a single , strong party that represents the german community . " the report found most of the participants said they felt powerless to help define politics , the study also revealed a widespread disillusionment with democracy and democratic principles . far-right parties are present in two german state governments but are not represented at the federal level .
the far-right national democratic party has also called for nationalizing banks in the wake of the financial crisis . germany 's main parties also lost some of their trustworthiness in some people 's eyes after they all approved the massive bank rescue package a short time after saying there was no money to increase social spending , butterwegge said .

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .

ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .

this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .
the trial launched on monday is the first of the kind in bulgaria . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .
the trial launched on monday is the first of the kind in bulgaria . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 20.10.2008 cultural sponsoring untouched by financial crisis woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank , whose art is on loan at staedel museum , is a big corporate patron german funding for the arts comes mainly from public spending , unlike the united states , where wall street 's woes cut into wealthy patrons ' pockets .
but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .
" look at berlin .
we have at least three opera houses here , and berlin is broke . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .
the resulting cells could be further implanted into his brain to replace those lost to the disease .
moreover , the same method could be used to create heart , pancreatic or liver cells . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .
the resulting cells could be further implanted into his brain to replace those lost to the disease .
moreover , the same method could be used to create heart , pancreatic or liver cells . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .
" look at berlin .
we have at least three opera houses here , and berlin is broke . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

automakers are among those who may be able to look forward to state support . berlin plans " targeted measures " to boost the german economy but aims to avoid a nationwide stimulus package , government spokesman thomas steg said monday , oct .

" the chancellor spoke out -lrb- at the cabinet meeting -rrb- specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg said at a press conference .
" what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries .

" there 's a bumpy road ahead of us , " he said at a meeting of the spd , which governs in a grand coalition with merkel 's christian democratic union , " after the rescue shield for the banks , we need a protective shield for jobs .

automakers are among those who may be able to look forward to state support . berlin plans " targeted measures " to boost the german economy but aims to avoid a nationwide stimulus package , government spokesman thomas steg said monday , oct .

" the chancellor spoke out -lrb- at the cabinet meeting -rrb- specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg said at a press conference .
" what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries . " steg added the measures would have to be " convincing , affordable and , first and foremost , able to be put into place quickly .

steg said no specific measures were discussed by the cabinet on monday but added that carmakers would receive close attention . " from the chancellor 's point of view , the automobile industry is a very important branch because it still has a superior position in terms of employment , " steg said . the industry has also requested state support . " the uncertainty of consumers has been increased by the financial crisis , " said eckehart rotter , a spokesman for the german automobile association -lrb- vda -rrb- .

" there 's a bumpy road ahead of us , " he said at a meeting of the spd , which governs in a grand coalition with merkel 's christian democratic union , " after the rescue shield for the banks , we need a protective shield for jobs .
the job 's not done with the financial rescue .

" economy languishing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts have said a german recession is likely the moves came ahead of an announcement on monday from the german central bank that europe 's largest economy had likely stagnated in the third quarter of 2008 . in the second quarter of 2008 , german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank by 0.5 percent on a quarterly basis and a number of economists had been forecasting a further drop in the third quarter . the technical definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth . german economy minister michael glos last week cut his 2009 growth outlook to just 0.2 percent , a fraction of the previous forecast of 1.2 percent . other economic institutions , however , were more pessimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 20.10.2008 cultural sponsoring untouched by financial crisis woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank , whose art is on loan at staedel museum , is a big corporate patron german funding for the arts comes mainly from public spending , unlike the united states , where wall street 's woes cut into wealthy patrons ' pockets .
but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .
" look at berlin .
we have at least three opera houses here , and berlin is broke . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic .

in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad .

" still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 20.10.2008 cultural sponsoring untouched by financial crisis woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank , whose art is on loan at staedel museum , is a big corporate patron german funding for the arts comes mainly from public spending , unlike the united states , where wall street 's woes cut into wealthy patrons ' pockets .
but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic .

in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad .

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .

italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .

" i am , of course , not prophesying that far-right extremists grab power like they did on january 30 , 1933 , " political scientist christoph butterwegge told german news agency dpa .
" but it is striking how similar the cycles are . " the bankruptcy of financial institutions and plunging stock markets set off a global economic crisis that led to mass unemployment in germany that the national socialist german workers party took advantage of for its growth . some economists have said they fear increased unemployment in germany could also be an effect of the current global financial crisis . unemployment fertile ground for extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies are mixed on the connection between far-right parties and unemployment the international labor organization warned on monday , oct .

while thousands have already been laid off in the world 's financial centers , ilo head juan somavia said ordinary working people could feel the brunt of the lay-offs . " this is not simply a crisis on wall street , this is a crisis on all streets .
we need an economic rescue plan for working families and the real economy , with rules and policies that deliver decent jobs , " he said . higher unemployment typically leads to an increased acceptance of far-right parties , butterwegge said . " the competition for resources will get much stronger when the state spends even a fraction of the 480 billion euros in the financial injections and guarantees , " he said , adding that feelings of social injustice could mainly benefit parties that call for authoritarian forms of government . a study presented this summer by the friedrich ebert foundation found 37 percent of the german population said immigrants come to germany " to exploit the welfare state , " 39 percent think germany " is dangerously over-run with foreigners , " and 26 percent would like " a single , strong party that represents the german community . " the report found most of the participants said they felt powerless to help define politics , the study also revealed a widespread disillusionment with democracy and democratic principles . far-right parties are present in two german state governments but are not represented at the federal level .
the far-right national democratic party has also called for nationalizing banks in the wake of the financial crisis . germany 's main parties also lost some of their trustworthiness in some people 's eyes after they all approved the massive bank rescue package a short time after saying there was no money to increase social spending , butterwegge said . " the far-right extremists know how to use that to their advantage , " he added .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .
" the financial crisis does not stop climate change , " he said .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the financial crisis was being used as an excuse by states afraid of the economic consequences of bridling carbon emissions .
" if we do n't make it -lrb- to agreement by december -rrb- , the international negotiations on climate change are going to be seriously compromised , " he said .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas chimed in , referring to the eu plan as " the red line . "
he said any adjustments to the plan would have to avoid " touching the environmental objective . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .

" the blast took place on a main road .
this is the work of terrorists .
we have arrested two suspects in relation to the incident , " he said . two other children who were playing nearby and two german soldiers were also wounded , provincial governor mohammad omar said . the governor said the attacker on a bicycle blew himself up next to a german army convoy in the chardara district , five kilometers south of kunduz city . the taliban took responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its website , saying one of its fighters , identified only as islamuddin , carried out the attack . a spokesman for the hard-line taliban , zabihullah mujahid , claimed a dozen foreign soldiers had been killed . nato , germany confirm deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin confirmed the attack had targeted the bundeswehr the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- also confirmed the deaths of two of its soldiers in a statement issued by its headquarters in kabul . " acts such as this , which offer nothing but violence and death , will not deter us in our commitment to create a better afghanistan , " brigadier general richard blanchette , an isaf spokesman said . the isaf commander did not give the nationalities of the dead troops but the german defense ministry , which approved the deployment of an additional 1,000 german troops to afghanistan last week , confirmed monday 's bombing as taking place near to where its troops were based , just outside of kunduz . provincial governor omar said the two troops killed were german . taliban militants have recently heavily relied on suicide and roadside bombings as part of their campaign against the western-backed afghan government and international forces . " we have information that five bombers have entered into the province , " omar added , raising concerns that the region would be plagued by more assaults in the future . northern afghanistan is relatively peaceful compared with the south and east , where taliban militants are the most active . bundeswehr deployment one of the largest in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troops are increasingly at risk from attack more than 3,500 german soldiers are stationed in the northern provinces .
the soldiers are part of around 50,000 isaf troops that have been deployed to the country after the 2001 ouster of the taliban regime . germany has one of the biggest contingents in isaf , based largely in the northern towns of mazar-i-sharif and kunduz . another german soldier was killed in the same district at the end of august in a roadside bombing .
the taliban claimed responsibility for that blast . it was the second suicide attack in afghanistan on monday after another bomber blew himself up against an armored afghan army vehicle in the southern town of lashkar gah but killed only himself .
the attacker , who detonated bombs strapped to his body , appeared to be around 15 years old , afghan army officer gul noor said .
the vehicle was badly damaged . the taliban have attacked lashkar gah , the capital of volatile helmand province , several times in the past week but have been repelled in battles that afghan authorities said had left several rebel fighters dead . increase of suicide bombings as insurgency swells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings have increased as the taliban push on afghanistan has seen a spate of suicide attacks , which are most usually aimed at international forces but kill more civilians . most of the attacks are claimed by the taliban , the islamist extremist movement which has been waging an insurgency in afghanistan . the group was in government between 1996 and 2001 when they were toppled in a us-led invasion after refusing to hand over al-qaeda militants blamed for the 9/11 attacks on the united states . they are fighting to take back control in an insurgency that has grown year on year . nato has about 50,000 soldiers from nearly 40 countries in afghanistan helping the government to assert its authority . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on.

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .
i think the czech prime minister is looking forward to it , " she said , adding that she looked forward to working closely with the czech government .
czechs slow on treaty uptake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister mirek topolanek has remained critical of the lisbon treaty despite giving his approval the czech premier acknowledged it would be problematic for the eu 's presiding country to negotiate on future ratification steps with dublin without itself having ratified the pact .
irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .
topolanek , whose governing party has a significant eurosceptic streak , called the treaty " a very tough compromise " and the price for belonging to " a certain orbit of civilization . "
" that is why i support it despite all the problems i have with it , " he said .

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .
i think the czech prime minister is looking forward to it , " she said , adding that she looked forward to working closely with the czech government .
czechs slow on treaty uptake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister mirek topolanek has remained critical of the lisbon treaty despite giving his approval the czech premier acknowledged it would be problematic for the eu 's presiding country to negotiate on future ratification steps with dublin without itself having ratified the pact .
irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .
topolanek , whose governing party has a significant eurosceptic streak , called the treaty " a very tough compromise " and the price for belonging to " a certain orbit of civilization . "
" that is why i support it despite all the problems i have with it , " he said .
merkel 's meeting with topolanek also focused on the financial crisis affecting most major economies .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .
the resulting cells could be further implanted into his brain to replace those lost to the disease .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.10.2008 mad world of sports still calm amid financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passion for sport seems not to have been dimmed by the financial crisis with banks battling to survive , markets seeing takeover bids and company chiefs facing penalities for poor performance , it seems commerce chambers are beating sports pitches and locker rooms for sheer drama these days . the world of sports - as yet - appears remarkably unaffected by the global market crisis .
this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .
all in all , hecht counts himself lucky not to have been affected by a financial crisis which has reeked havoc across a plethora of industries throughout nations developed and developing . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .

petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .
all in all , hecht counts himself lucky not to have been affected by a financial crisis which has reeked havoc across a plethora of industries throughout nations developed and developing . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .

italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .

it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .

we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .

" the blast took place on a main road .
this is the work of terrorists .
we have arrested two suspects in relation to the incident , " he said . two other children who were playing nearby and two german soldiers were also wounded , provincial governor mohammad omar said . the governor said the attacker on a bicycle blew himself up next to a german army convoy in the chardara district , five kilometers south of kunduz city . the taliban took responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its website , saying one of its fighters , identified only as islamuddin , carried out the attack . a spokesman for the hard-line taliban , zabihullah mujahid , claimed a dozen foreign soldiers had been killed . nato , germany confirm deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin confirmed the attack had targeted the bundeswehr the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- also confirmed the deaths of two of its soldiers in a statement issued by its headquarters in kabul . " acts such as this , which offer nothing but violence and death , will not deter us in our commitment to create a better afghanistan , " brigadier general richard blanchette , an isaf spokesman said . the isaf commander did not give the nationalities of the dead troops but the german defense ministry , which approved the deployment of an additional 1,000 german troops to afghanistan last week , confirmed monday 's bombing as taking place near to where its troops were based , just outside of kunduz . provincial governor omar said the two troops killed were german . taliban militants have recently heavily relied on suicide and roadside bombings as part of their campaign against the western-backed afghan government and international forces . " we have information that five bombers have entered into the province , " omar added , raising concerns that the region would be plagued by more assaults in the future . northern afghanistan is relatively peaceful compared with the south and east , where taliban militants are the most active . bundeswehr deployment one of the largest in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troops are increasingly at risk from attack more than 3,500 german soldiers are stationed in the northern provinces .
the soldiers are part of around 50,000 isaf troops that have been deployed to the country after the 2001 ouster of the taliban regime . germany has one of the biggest contingents in isaf , based largely in the northern towns of mazar-i-sharif and kunduz . another german soldier was killed in the same district at the end of august in a roadside bombing .
the taliban claimed responsibility for that blast . it was the second suicide attack in afghanistan on monday after another bomber blew himself up against an armored afghan army vehicle in the southern town of lashkar gah but killed only himself .
the attacker , who detonated bombs strapped to his body , appeared to be around 15 years old , afghan army officer gul noor said .
the vehicle was badly damaged . the taliban have attacked lashkar gah , the capital of volatile helmand province , several times in the past week but have been repelled in battles that afghan authorities said had left several rebel fighters dead . increase of suicide bombings as insurgency swells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings have increased as the taliban push on afghanistan has seen a spate of suicide attacks , which are most usually aimed at international forces but kill more civilians . most of the attacks are claimed by the taliban , the islamist extremist movement which has been waging an insurgency in afghanistan . the group was in government between 1996 and 2001 when they were toppled in a us-led invasion after refusing to hand over al-qaeda militants blamed for the 9/11 attacks on the united states . they are fighting to take back control in an insurgency that has grown year on year . nato has about 50,000 soldiers from nearly 40 countries in afghanistan helping the government to assert its authority . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .
i think the czech prime minister is looking forward to it , " she said , adding that she looked forward to working closely with the czech government .
czechs slow on treaty uptake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister mirek topolanek has remained critical of the lisbon treaty despite giving his approval the czech premier acknowledged it would be problematic for the eu 's presiding country to negotiate on future ratification steps with dublin without itself having ratified the pact .
irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .
topolanek , whose governing party has a significant eurosceptic streak , called the treaty " a very tough compromise " and the price for belonging to " a certain orbit of civilization . "
" that is why i support it despite all the problems i have with it , " he said .
merkel 's meeting with topolanek also focused on the financial crisis affecting most major economies .
the czech government and central bank have said the czech banking system was stable and the country has not been hit hard by the global financial crisis . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .
the trial launched on monday is the first of the kind in bulgaria . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 20.10.2008 czech leader tells merkel : eu presidency will be in safe hands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel sought to quell fears over the impending czech presidency of the eu czech prime minister mirek topolanek said monday he was dedicated to ratifying the european union 's lisbon treaty before his country takes over the bloc 's presidency on jan .
1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .
i think the czech prime minister is looking forward to it , " she said , adding that she looked forward to working closely with the czech government .
czechs slow on treaty uptake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister mirek topolanek has remained critical of the lisbon treaty despite giving his approval the czech premier acknowledged it would be problematic for the eu 's presiding country to negotiate on future ratification steps with dublin without itself having ratified the pact .
irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .
topolanek , whose governing party has a significant eurosceptic streak , called the treaty " a very tough compromise " and the price for belonging to " a certain orbit of civilization . "
" that is why i support it despite all the problems i have with it , " he said .
merkel 's meeting with topolanek also focused on the financial crisis affecting most major economies .

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .

new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .
the resulting cells could be further implanted into his brain to replace those lost to the disease .
moreover , the same method could be used to create heart , pancreatic or liver cells . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the blast took place on a main road .
this is the work of terrorists .
we have arrested two suspects in relation to the incident , " he said . two other children who were playing nearby and two german soldiers were also wounded , provincial governor mohammad omar said . the governor said the attacker on a bicycle blew himself up next to a german army convoy in the chardara district , five kilometers south of kunduz city . the taliban took responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its website , saying one of its fighters , identified only as islamuddin , carried out the attack . a spokesman for the hard-line taliban , zabihullah mujahid , claimed a dozen foreign soldiers had been killed . nato , germany confirm deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin confirmed the attack had targeted the bundeswehr the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- also confirmed the deaths of two of its soldiers in a statement issued by its headquarters in kabul . " acts such as this , which offer nothing but violence and death , will not deter us in our commitment to create a better afghanistan , " brigadier general richard blanchette , an isaf spokesman said . the isaf commander did not give the nationalities of the dead troops but the german defense ministry , which approved the deployment of an additional 1,000 german troops to afghanistan last week , confirmed monday 's bombing as taking place near to where its troops were based , just outside of kunduz . provincial governor omar said the two troops killed were german . taliban militants have recently heavily relied on suicide and roadside bombings as part of their campaign against the western-backed afghan government and international forces . " we have information that five bombers have entered into the province , " omar added , raising concerns that the region would be plagued by more assaults in the future . northern afghanistan is relatively peaceful compared with the south and east , where taliban militants are the most active . bundeswehr deployment one of the largest in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troops are increasingly at risk from attack more than 3,500 german soldiers are stationed in the northern provinces .
the soldiers are part of around 50,000 isaf troops that have been deployed to the country after the 2001 ouster of the taliban regime . germany has one of the biggest contingents in isaf , based largely in the northern towns of mazar-i-sharif and kunduz . another german soldier was killed in the same district at the end of august in a roadside bombing .
the taliban claimed responsibility for that blast . it was the second suicide attack in afghanistan on monday after another bomber blew himself up against an armored afghan army vehicle in the southern town of lashkar gah but killed only himself .
the attacker , who detonated bombs strapped to his body , appeared to be around 15 years old , afghan army officer gul noor said .
the vehicle was badly damaged . the taliban have attacked lashkar gah , the capital of volatile helmand province , several times in the past week but have been repelled in battles that afghan authorities said had left several rebel fighters dead . increase of suicide bombings as insurgency swells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide bombings have increased as the taliban push on afghanistan has seen a spate of suicide attacks , which are most usually aimed at international forces but kill more civilians . most of the attacks are claimed by the taliban , the islamist extremist movement which has been waging an insurgency in afghanistan . the group was in government between 1996 and 2001 when they were toppled in a us-led invasion after refusing to hand over al-qaeda militants blamed for the 9/11 attacks on the united states . they are fighting to take back control in an insurgency that has grown year on year . nato has about 50,000 soldiers from nearly 40 countries in afghanistan helping the government to assert its authority . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this country is in motion , both culturally and politically , " book fair director juergen boos said . turkey had made full use of the opportunities that " appearing on the greatest literary world stage has to offer , " boos said . more than the " well-known problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last visitors left the book fair on sunday , oct .
19 the turkish organizing committee was visibly anxious to exclude all political elements from its events . " the name turkey should evoke more than just the well-known usual problems , " istanbul publisher muge gorsoy sokmen said . many of the freedom of expression issues other nations have with turkey deal with a section of turkish penal code that makes it a crime to " denigrate turknishness " and threatens violators with up to three years in prison . but sokmen said it was important for her that turkish writers were perceived " simply as artists " and not as " mouthpieces for the government or dissidents . " turkish politics in three acts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish literature was in high demand in frankfurt the contradictions of turkish life and the political problems in which the country is embroiled were acted out during the five-day book fair . pamuk entered the stage for the first act at the beginning of the fair with a soliloquy in which he said , " the propensity of the turkish state to ban books and punish writers is unfortunately continuing . " president abdullah gul commanded the second act when turkish journalists asked him shortly before he left for frankfurt to react to pamuk 's comments and to " negative reports " in the german press . the questions allowed gul to portray himself as a defender of criticism and turkey as a land of free speech by saying there was no book that could not be published and " equally extreme views " would be expressed . " turkey is not a country of prohibitions , " he added . turkish publishers took charge of the third act , like children who had been burnt , but were still unafraid of fire . they spoke of the state 's and the military 's paternalism and said that not much had changed . more changes needed as long as this " authoritarian mentality " remained , freedom of expression would remain limited , etyen mahcupyan of the armenian-turkish weekly agos said . there would be no freedom of expression without a fundamental change in mentality , publisher ragip zarakolu said . in order to achieve this , he said " much more radical changes " were needed " than have happened so far . " for its part , amnesty international said the book fair could have a lasting , positive effect on the condition of human rights in turkey even if the improvements were n't immediately visable . " it does n't change the situation in turkey yet , of course , but it is a step on the path towards breaking taboos , " amnesty 's turkey expert amke dietert told german news agency dpa .

17 . the conditions include capping the maximum capital injection which each bank may receive at 10 billion euros , a finance ministry spokesman said . executive salaries at banks that get help will be capped at 500,000 euros , although exceptions are possible . those managers would also be forced to give up bonuses and dividend payments during the period their banks were indebted to the state . the government is also planning to exercise influence over the business strategy of financial houses that have been hit by the crisis , which is likely to result in banks steering away from risky investments . up to 400 billion euro from the package is earmarked for lending guarantees for banks , with the remaining 80 billion going towards recapitalizing institutions and , if necessary , purchasing risky assets . in announcing the conditions for the bailout package , the government also made a stern appeal to shaky german financial institutions to take up its offer . banks ' responses mixed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann said he would be ashamed if deutsche bank accepted government funds but the heads of a collection of germany 's largest commercial banks said they would not immediately seek a portion of the funds under the current terms . deutsche bank chief josef ackermann said saturday his bank did not require a cash injection from the bailout package . ackermann said that " at no point " had deutsche bank been in danger during the financial crisis . " i would be ashamed if we were to take state money during this crisis , " he said . ackermann 's comments ruffled officials ' feathers , however , with government spokesman thomas steg saying the deutsche bank chief 's words aroused ire at a meeting of the german cabinet on monday . steg labelled the comments " totally incomprehensible " and " objectionable .

this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .
all in all , hecht counts himself lucky not to have been affected by a financial crisis which has reeked havoc across a plethora of industries throughout nations developed and developing . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

automakers are among those who may be able to look forward to state support . berlin plans " targeted measures " to boost the german economy but aims to avoid a nationwide stimulus package , government spokesman thomas steg said monday , oct .
20 . chancellor angela merkel told the economy and finance ministers to develop possible ways of aiding industries hit hard by the effects of the global financial crisis by november , steg said . " the chancellor spoke out -lrb- at the cabinet meeting -rrb- specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg said at a press conference .
" what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries . " steg added the measures would have to be " convincing , affordable and , first and foremost , able to be put into place quickly . " the cabinet will then decide which measures are appropriate while drafting up its 2009 budget , which is due to be finalized next month , steg said . automakers could see aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car industry has said the state needs to take action in tough economic times media reports said on monday that the measures being considered included tax breaks for low-emissions cars and state guarantees on loans to small and medium sized companies .
steg said no specific measures were discussed by the cabinet on monday but added that carmakers would receive close attention . " from the chancellor 's point of view , the automobile industry is a very important branch because it still has a superior position in terms of employment , " steg said . the industry has also requested state support . " the uncertainty of consumers has been increased by the financial crisis , " said eckehart rotter , a spokesman for the german automobile association -lrb- vda -rrb- .

" there 's a bumpy road ahead of us , " he said at a meeting of the spd , which governs in a grand coalition with merkel 's christian democratic union , " after the rescue shield for the banks , we need a protective shield for jobs .
the job 's not done with the financial rescue .
the crisis will hit the economy .
how hard and for how long depends on us .

this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .

" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .

' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .

" what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries .

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic .

in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad .

" we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .
" look at berlin .
we have at least three opera houses here , and berlin is broke . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 20.10.2008 czech leader tells merkel : eu presidency will be in safe hands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel sought to quell fears over the impending czech presidency of the eu czech prime minister mirek topolanek said monday he was dedicated to ratifying the european union 's lisbon treaty before his country takes over the bloc 's presidency on jan .
1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .
i think the czech prime minister is looking forward to it , " she said , adding that she looked forward to working closely with the czech government .
czechs slow on treaty uptake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister mirek topolanek has remained critical of the lisbon treaty despite giving his approval the czech premier acknowledged it would be problematic for the eu 's presiding country to negotiate on future ratification steps with dublin without itself having ratified the pact .
irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .
topolanek , whose governing party has a significant eurosceptic streak , called the treaty " a very tough compromise " and the price for belonging to " a certain orbit of civilization . "
" that is why i support it despite all the problems i have with it , " he said .
merkel 's meeting with topolanek also focused on the financial crisis affecting most major economies .

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .
i think the czech prime minister is looking forward to it , " she said , adding that she looked forward to working closely with the czech government .
czechs slow on treaty uptake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister mirek topolanek has remained critical of the lisbon treaty despite giving his approval the czech premier acknowledged it would be problematic for the eu 's presiding country to negotiate on future ratification steps with dublin without itself having ratified the pact .
irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .
topolanek , whose governing party has a significant eurosceptic streak , called the treaty " a very tough compromise " and the price for belonging to " a certain orbit of civilization . "
" that is why i support it despite all the problems i have with it , " he said .
merkel 's meeting with topolanek also focused on the financial crisis affecting most major economies .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .

but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .
" look at berlin .

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .
i think the czech prime minister is looking forward to it , " she said , adding that she looked forward to working closely with the czech government .

irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .
the trial launched on monday is the first of the kind in bulgaria . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .

1 . topolanek 's assurances came during a visit to prague by german chancellor angela merkel , who urged the czech republic to pass the stalled reform treaty so the eu could move ahead on efforts to bring it into force .
czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .
topolanek , who inked the treaty along with other eu leaders last december , said the czech parliament would take up the treaty as soon as the high court had cleared it .
merkel sells lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty is still prevalent in pockets throughout the eu merkel said she hoped ratification of the treaty by prague would be achieved by the time the czechs began their presidency of the eu so the bloc could continue working with ireland on " completing ratification " there .
she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .
" we will have a good presidency .
i think the czech prime minister is looking forward to it , " she said , adding that she looked forward to working closely with the czech government .
czechs slow on treaty uptake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister mirek topolanek has remained critical of the lisbon treaty despite giving his approval the czech premier acknowledged it would be problematic for the eu 's presiding country to negotiate on future ratification steps with dublin without itself having ratified the pact .
irish voters rejected the accord , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member bloc , in a june referendum .
ireland was the only country to take the treaty to the polls , while the czech republic and sweden are also yet to ratify the treaty .
topolanek , whose governing party has a significant eurosceptic streak , called the treaty " a very tough compromise " and the price for belonging to " a certain orbit of civilization . "
" that is why i support it despite all the problems i have with it , " he said .
merkel 's meeting with topolanek also focused on the financial crisis affecting most major economies .

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .

olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .

there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .

but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .

this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .

this is why tennis player andrea petkovic will be keeping her focus firmly on fitness , not on finances , these coming months .
" to be honest , the economic crisis has not affected me at all , " the 21-year-old told german news agency dpa .
petkovic is currently in italy trying to return to top form after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament in january at the australian open .
after almost eight months on the sidelines , the former top 100 player says training and matches are her priority more so than lucrative winner 's purses .
' recession-proof ' world of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some die-hard fans will never abandon their teams jens-peter hecht , a former german tennis federation spokesman who nowadays runs his own public relations and marketing agency , also said the global financial turmoil was not upsetting his calm .
" the crisis has not hit me , " says the 62-year-old from the northern german town of lueneburg .
tennis officials have said in recent weeks they do not expect global sports to take too big a hit from the worldwide financial crisis .
" we have to be concerned .
but sports tends to be recession-protected .
there is always a lot of investment into sports , " the head of the women 's tour wta , larry scott , told dpa .
nonetheless , the wta title sponsor , sony-ericsson , reported third-quarter losses of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- last friday as turnover dropped 10 percent to 2.8 billion euros .
the impact these types of losses will have on the global sporting landscape is as yet undefined .
soccer clubs ' futures uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign soccer club owners such as icelandic investor bjorgolfur gudmundsson say they 'll stick with their teams in soccer , west ham united 's icelandic billionaire owner bjorgolfur gudmundsson said he remained committed to the english club although he was a major stakeholder in iceland 's landsbanki which had to be nationalised in mid-october .
the london club may have to reduce its roster but is also reportedly close to signing a new lucrative shirt sponsor deal .
english clubs have not yet suffered despite foreign ownership , but could be hit by a possible recession leading to less money flowing in from advertising and sponsorship , according to observers .
" the big question is whether we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship , " said uli hoeness , general manager of german champions bayern munich .
uncertainty over this question is fuelling debate in soccer club boardrooms , with the future of teams - whose sizes vary from bundesliga giants bayern down to lower-league amateur side hansa lueneburg - still unclear .
nonetheless , hecht , who is involved with the lueneburg team , remains cautiously optimistic in his northern german town near hamburg .
" the big companies would be more affected .
we have small local sponsors .
they would not immediately feel the impact , " he says .
ups and downs of sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days of graf glory , but professional sports live on hecht said he has seen the rise and fall of german tennis .
he was dtb spokesman in the heydays of boris becker and steffi graf when big money was generated , but he also saw tennis incomes fall dramatically once the icons retired and no new stars appeared .
the ardent golfer is still responsible for the magazine of the hamburg tennis tournament , which recently lost its prestigious masters series status and was downgraded to a tier two event .
production of the magazine largely depends on sponsors .
apart from tennis , hecht has organized motorcycle events in kiel , was the venue media officer in hanover at the 2006 soccer world cup and is in talks to become venue boss in wolfsburg during the 2011 women 's world cup .
but while his sports involvement remains promising , he says his non-sports activities , such as running pr workshops for local businesses , may suffer if the economy declines .
" things can happen quickly .
the companies may say ' lets scrap this or that . '
i may see it in seminars organized with the chamber of commerce , " says hecht .

" the chancellor spoke out -lrb- at the cabinet meeting -rrb- specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg said at a press conference .
" what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries . " steg added the measures would have to be " convincing , affordable and , first and foremost , able to be put into place quickly .

steg said no specific measures were discussed by the cabinet on monday but added that carmakers would receive close attention . " from the chancellor 's point of view , the automobile industry is a very important branch because it still has a superior position in terms of employment , " steg said . the industry has also requested state support . " the uncertainty of consumers has been increased by the financial crisis , " said eckehart rotter , a spokesman for the german automobile association -lrb- vda -rrb- .

" there 's a bumpy road ahead of us , " he said at a meeting of the spd , which governs in a grand coalition with merkel 's christian democratic union , " after the rescue shield for the banks , we need a protective shield for jobs .
the job 's not done with the financial rescue .
the crisis will hit the economy .

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .

czech ratification is not " artificially obstructed " and " could be completed by year 's end , " topolanek said of the treaty 's passage through the country 's legal and parliamentary systems .
the czech constitutional court is currently reviewing the treaty at the request of eurosceptic members of topolanek 's civic democratic party .
it is unclear just when a ruling on whether the treaty agrees with the czech constitution will be given .

she said the lisbon treaty would be necessary to boost simpler and closer relationships between eu states .
" in the current financial crisis , we can see how important such relationships are , " merkel said .
merkel also used the meeting with topolanek to dispel concerns the czech republic was not the right fit for the eu 's six-month rotating presidency .

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .

for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .
the resulting cells could be further implanted into his brain to replace those lost to the disease .
moreover , the same method could be used to create heart , pancreatic or liver cells . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .
" the financial crisis does not stop climate change , " he said .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the financial crisis was being used as an excuse by states afraid of the economic consequences of bridling carbon emissions .
" if we do n't make it -lrb- to agreement by december -rrb- , the international negotiations on climate change are going to be seriously compromised , " he said .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas chimed in , referring to the eu plan as " the red line . "
he said any adjustments to the plan would have to avoid " touching the environmental objective . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 20.10.2008 testicles an " ethical " stem cells source , german scientists claim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery may free german scientists from the constraints put on them by ethics faced with strict german laws banning the use of human embryos , a team of german scientists came up with a radical new " ethical " source for stem cells - men 's testicles . the scientists believe their breakthrough may offer a whole new range of treatments for diseases like parkinson 's and diabetes and for spinal cord injuries involving use of men 's own stem cells to replace damaged or diseased cells in their own bodies .
the researchers from the universities of tuebingen and cologne in germany , and king 's college london , say that routine biopsies of men 's testicles could provide a new source of stem cells which could be as good as embryonic stem cells for researching and developing treatments for a range of serious diseases , but without the ethical and legal problems of embryonic stem cells .
writing in the online edition of nature , professor thomas skutella , who leads an experimental embryology group at tuebingen university , says , " the generation of human adult germ-line stem cells from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells . "
stem cells are the new hope for treatment development because they carry the potential of personalized therapy - using a person 's own cells to create stem cells that can then repair and replace damaged tissue , such as in parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and cancers .
this way the big problem of immune system rejection is overcome because the implants have the same dna as the host .
new treatment only for men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source of the cells means only men benefit the drawback , however , is that using stem cells from male testes , the treatment would only work on men .
stem cells from embryos have the potential to become any cell in the body ; after all , a whole person grows from a single fertilized egg .
but getting stem cells from embryos is fraught with ethical problems since it involves the destruction of embryos .
in germany , stem cell research involving embryos is prohibited by federal law .
for years , scientists in germany have been working to find legal alternative ways to make stem cells with the same ability to become any cell in the body as the embryonic stem cell .
testicle cells do not need dna insertion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakthrough may limit the use of embryos in research skutella and his colleagues had a hunch that there was another source of stem cells , ones that did not need to have genes inserted into their dna to make them into cells that produce other cells , because they do that already : the sperm producing cells inside adult male testicles .
for their study , the german researchers used testicular tissue from 22 male volunteers between 17 and 81 years of age .
after collecting the tissues , they were isolated and then cultured to grow into stem cells .
" we made them into skin , structures of the gut , cartilage , bone , muscle and neurons , " skutella was quoted by new scientist as saying .
" the advantage these cells have in comparison to embryonic stem cells is that there is no ethical problem with these cells and that they are natural , " said skutella .
if further research shows that the resulting cells are normal , it could allow men to grow their own tissue for transplant .
cells could be taken from a parkinson 's disease patient 's testicles , nurtured in a laboratory and turned into brain cells .
the resulting cells could be further implanted into his brain to replace those lost to the disease .
moreover , the same method could be used to create heart , pancreatic or liver cells . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds . a bulgarian court on monday launched a trial against 9 people accused of embezzling millions from european union aid funds .
the defendants were accused of stealing 14 million leva -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- from funds made available to bulgaria by the eu as part of the sapard -lrb- special accession programme for agriculture and rural development -rrb- programme .
the defendants allegedly imported used machinery for meat processing , but forged documents so the machines could be registered as new .
the eu fund was drawn upon for the cost of new equipment , with the defendants allegedly pocketing the difference .
a probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the european anti-fraud office -lrb- olaf -rrb- .
however , the amount of money cited in the indictment covers only part of the missing funds .
olaf said in a confidential report , leaked earlier this year , that more than 50 million dollars were missing .
but the report said the money was only missing from funds intended for bulgarian farming .
there are suspicions of much wider abuse and hints of political protection for perpetrators .
the reported widespread abuse spurred brussels into freezing nearly 500 million euros -lrb- 800 million dollars -rrb- in various development programmes for bulgaria in july .
the balkan country joined the eu in 2007 , but remains plagued by corruption and an inefficient judiciary .
in order to control the distribution of eu funds , sofia in june agreed to allow brussels bureaucrats to install a real-time monitoring system .
the trial launched on monday is the first of the kind in bulgaria . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .

in opposition , italy 's voice was loudest as it labelled the plan unreasonable , arguing that , coupled with the financial crisis , such lofty emission targets would place an unacceptable burden on its economy .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who last week threatened to veto the reduction plans , called for a review mechanism that would allow for changes to the eu 's targets once the plan 's costs had been accurately calculated .
last year the eu pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
it also promised to ensure that renewable energies would make up 20 percent of its energy sources .
to achieve these targets , heavy industry , which accounts for around 40 percent of the eu 's carbon emissions , would have to cut its emissions by 21 percent from 2005 levels .
coalition of the unwilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has moved to protect domestic interests italy said the plan would cost its economy around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- a year , although the european commission puts that figure at a more modest 12 billion euros .
italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo insisted several eu states were just as unenthusiastic about the eu plan .
" the package as it stands right now is not suitable .
it is untenable .
significant changes are needed , " she said .
" we are not the only ones to take this position .
" we demand a review clause .
we hope now that real negotiations will be opened .
we 've come with good intentions .
we are going to ask for many modifications and we hope they will be taken into account , " she said .
the baltic states , along with bulgaria , hungary , romania , slovakia and poland also raised objections to the eu plan , exposing fears their coal-reliant energy sectors would not be able to adapt in time .
in clear acts of economic protectionism , rome and warsaw convinced their eu partners to formally accept the package at the upcoming eu summit in december only if unanimous , rather than majority , support was given for it .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel said international climate talks depend on the eu plan but some eu environment ministers remained resolute that ambitious targets were necessary to curb dangerous global warming .
" we can underline the strong willingness from the eu states to intensify their work to reach an accord " in december , french environment minister jean-louis borloo said after chairing environment talks in luxembourg .
" the financial crisis does not stop climate change , " he said .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the financial crisis was being used as an excuse by states afraid of the economic consequences of bridling carbon emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 20.10.2008 cultural sponsoring untouched by financial crisis woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank , whose art is on loan at staedel museum , is a big corporate patron german funding for the arts comes mainly from public spending , unlike the united states , where wall street 's woes cut into wealthy patrons ' pockets .
but corporate sponsorships are catching on in germany . when lehman brothers collapsed in september , shockwaves coursed through the world 's financial markets , but the museums that benefited from the wall street institution 's patronage also felt the tremors . in 2007 , lehman spent $ 39 million -lrb- 29 million euros -rrb- on charitable giving that included sponsoring a brice marden retrospective at new york 's moma and a jackson pollock exhibit at the guggenheim .
through its now defunct foundation in europe , sponsorships were forged with frankfurt 's staedel museum and london 's national gallery and tate modern . at staedel , which now has a new partnership with the bank of america , there has been no negative impact of the credit crunch on corporate philanthropy so far , said the museum 's spokeswoman dorothea apovnik . " still , we ought to make much more of an effort to attract even more corporate support , " said apovnik referring to the public-private partnerships that are ubiquitous in the us and beginning to catch on in germany . private arts support as marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school competition created brand awareness for telekom businesses are discovering that their support for the arts is helping to increase brand awareness , according to michael hutter , a cultural economist at the social science research center in berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- . " this is especially prevalent for companies that have a product which has little visibility , such as insurance or banking , " he said . deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann proved that last week by generating considerable publicity over the long term loan of 600 works of art to staedel 's already extensive permanent collection of prints and sculpture , renaissance masters and modern painters . the initiative had been planned long before chaos descended on financial markets , but the timing was fortuitous , said deutsche bank spokesman frank hartmann .
he said the banking industry desperately needs to improve its image at a time when public anger is boiling over the mess created by investment banks . " we need -lrb- to project -rrb- this goodwill , " said hartmann , who added the financial crisis would not affect any present commitments that have already been earmarked , such as being the lead sponsor for the berlin philharmonic . " for 2010 and beyond , it is too early to speculate on whether corporate giving would drop or not , " he said . less disposable income for the arts bildunterschrift : a franco-russian exhibit sponsored by energy giant e.on might have been axed some businesses , however , may wind up having less money available to spend on supporting the arts , according to maren otten , the spokeswoman for corporate cultural projects at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- . last year 's immensely popular " bonjour russland " art exhibition that featured french and russian masterpieces , had been sponsored by the dusseldorf energy giant e.on. " this is the type of project that might have been axed in today 's climate , " said otten . but even if sponsorships and gifts were to decline in the coming years , otten added that the impact on the performing and visual arts would still be relatively small . funding differences in germany , financial support for education and culture comes primarily from state and local governments while american institutions rely on corporate support . public spending accounted for 94 percent of germany 's overall arts budget of over 8 billion euros in 2007 , with corporate sponsorships and foundation or individual donations making up the rest , according to the bdi .
in 2006 , the national endowment for the arts was allocated a budget of $ 125 million . this means that the billions of dollars to support the arts all across america must come from businesses with deep pockets and wealthy patrons , making the renovation of an opera house or a design competition for young artistic talent , vulnerable when economic times are bad . " when businesses need to cut expenses , these voluntary obligations are the first to go , " hutter said . german attitude that the state pays for culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unter den linden is one of berlin 's opera houses he added that while americans are expected to give back to society after striking it rich , germans expect arts funding to come from the high income and corporate taxes they pay the state . but hutter , who lives in berlin , said he does see one drawback when governments pay for culture : a duplication of cultural institutions and services , which can be an inefficient drain on taxpayer money . " there is no country in the world with such a density in the performing arts as germany , " he said .
" look at berlin .
we have at least three opera houses here , and berlin is broke . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgium has launched a drive to reshape its institutions , following months of government paralysis .
at the heart of the crisis is a tension between the dutch-speaking flemish and francophones .
in the final of a series of articles , henri astier asks if belgium can remain united , and considers the lessons for other multi-ethnic entities .
earlier this month the flemish sports minister suggested restructuring belgium 's football federation , creating francophone and dutch-speaking wings .
the plan drew loud boos from french-speakers .
the vice-president of national champions standard liege called it as a " dangerous first step towards a split " - and threatened to make an even bigger step by joining the french league if it went ahead .
the row neatly encapsulates what some fear could be the unravelling of belgium itself .
the events might unfold along the following lines : the autonomy-minded flemish , who are richer and more numerous than french-speakers , grow impatient with protracted devolution talks ; in next year 's regional election flemish nationalists do well ; alarmed francophones seek solace in a union with france .
a recent poll by le soir newspaper suggested that 49 % of people in wallonia , the french-speaking half of belgium , want to become french if their country breaks up .
" there is a vicious circle where francophones feel that radicalisation is gathering pace in flanders , " says olivier mouton , le soir 's political editor .
" they brace themselves for flemish independence and become radicalised themselves . "
flemish copernicus the paradox is that separation would happen without either side actively seeking it .
only about 10 % of flemish voters want independence .
support for unity is overwhelming in wallonia . "
for me the most important level will be the regional level " kris peeters minister-president of flanders could belgians really be sleepwalking towards separation ?
flemish leaders say they only want to reform the belgian state , not dismantle it .
" i am not in favour of the independence , " kris peeters , flanders ' minister-president , told the bbc news website .
" solidarity " between flanders and other regions will remain , he insists .
however his stated goal is a " copernican revolution " where federal powers are greatly reduced and the main decisions taken by regions .
" for me the most important level will be the regional level , " he says .
mr peeters ' career reflects this belief in the regions ' supremacy .
he spurned a seat in the belgian parliament .
asked what he would do if offered a key federal ministry he says unhesitatingly : " i would turn it down too . "
and his description of the current " dialogue between the communities " points to his ideal of quasi-sovereign entities : " we have two delegations , like two separate states discussing a treaty . "
anonymous celebrities some commentators believe that the dynamic of belgian politics lead the french and dutch speakers away from each other . "
the changes you bring to the political build-up of a country have a long-term snowballing effect " gie goris editor , mo magazine following devolution reforms over the past 45 years , all parties are now either dutch-speaking or french-speaking .
gie goris , editor of mo magazine , notes that countries which accept ethnically based politics , like sri lanka , are inherently unstable .
belgians are not about to kill each , mr goris admits , but they should be wary of ever more devolution : " the changes you bring to the political build-up of a country have a long-term snowballing effect . "
belgium has no common public sphere to speak of .
the communities do n't watch the same tv channels .
belgium by numbers 10.5 million people flanders : 6 million people wallonia : 3,5 million people brussels : 1 million people belgium 's devolution conundrum celebrities from one side can walk totally anonymously across the " linguistic border " - as it is tellingly called .
" you have a whole different cultural universe in the north and the south of the country , " says yves desmet , political commentator for the dutch-language de morgen newspaper .
differences are striking in both big and small ways .
although the railways are federal , train tickets are not bilingual - in flanders they are in dutch only , while tickets for the same journeys printed in wallonia are in french .
health habits also vary widely .
french-speakers , like most southern europeans , are heavy users of antibiotics and expensive diagnostic procedures such as mri scans , while the flemish tend to frown on these , as do most northern europeans .
digital divide to be sure , some things still unite belgians .
they drink the same beers .
they all cheered the mixed team that won silver for belgium in the women 's 4x100m olympic relay in beijing .
the king commands respect on both sides - although his flemish subjects are more lukewarm in their affection .
in economic matters , the picture is mixed .
flanders and wallonia are each other 's main trading partner , but in the booming technology sector contact is limited .
nonillion , an up-and-coming it firm based in ghent , does not have a single customer in wallonia .
chief executive rudi van den bossche says french is not a requirement for his staff .
" most of our customers ask for bilingual - meaning dutch and english , " he says .
in brussels , on the other hand , bilingualism tends increasingly to be the norm .
still , the overall picture is one of division .
" if you were a martian and read the flemish newspapers and the walloon newspapers you would think they 're describing two different countries , " says de morgen 's yves desmet .
you say you want a revolution but does this continued estrangement mean that belgium is doomed ?
many commentators do not think so . "
with us , rupture is never possible because compromise must always be reached " olivier chastel deputy foreign minister first there is the question of brussels .
the capital is a region in its own right , distinct from both flanders and wallonia .
it is also richer than both , as well as the seat of the eu and nato .
as a result , neither side can accept a takeover of the other on brussels .
and without it , each is a marginalised hinterland .
the status quo is thus the best option for both .
moreover , belgium 's proportional representation voting system is a big hurdle for those seeking radical change .
in a first-past-the-post systems , a winner clearly takes charge .
but belgian leaders have to cobble coalitions with groups from both sides of the divide .
" when -lsb- president nicolas -rsb- sarkozy is elected in france , he can implement a policy of ' rupture ' .
but with us , rupture is never possible because compromise must always be reached with other parties , " says belgian deputy foreign minister olivier chastel .
revolutions , copernican or otherwise , are mightily difficult to bring about in belgium .
muddling through according to dave sinardet , a political scientist at antwerp university , the fact that belgium 's communities lead largely separate lives , and have no great affection for each other , need not spell the end of the country .
" these things are also true of the european union and are not a problem for its continued existence , " he says .
this raises an interesting point about parallels between belgium and the eu .
the country was long regarded as a model for nations living in harmony under common institutions .
then , over the past year , the belgian stalemate was seen as a reflection of the eu 's divisions and the travails of its reform treaty .
the real parallel , however , may be neither rosy nor gloomy , but bitter-sweet .
in both belgium and the eu , shared institutions seem able to muddle through despite indifference from their constituent nations - rather like old couples who do n't talk but stay together because separation is more trouble than it is worth .
federalists both in belgium and europe might see this as too negative an argument for union - but it is a comfort of sorts .

the changes you bring to the political build-up of a country have a long-term snowballing effect gie goris editor , mo magazine following devolution reforms over the past 45 years , all parties are now either dutch-speaking or french-speaking .

belgians are not about to kill each , mr goris admits , but they should be wary of ever more devolution : " the changes you bring to the political build-up of a country have a long-term snowballing effect . "
belgium has no common public sphere to speak of .

" you have a whole different cultural universe in the north and the south of the country , " says yves desmet , political commentator for the dutch-language de morgen newspaper .
differences are striking in both big and small ways .
although the railways are federal , train tickets are not bilingual - in flanders they are in dutch only , while tickets for the same journeys printed in wallonia are in french .
health habits also vary widely .
french-speakers , like most southern europeans , are heavy users of antibiotics and expensive diagnostic procedures such as mri scans , while the flemish tend to frown on these , as do most northern europeans .
digital divide to be sure , some things still unite belgians .

belgium 's successful relay team enjoyed cross-community support the king commands respect on both sides - although his flemish subjects are more lukewarm in their affection .
in economic matters , the picture is mixed .
flanders and wallonia are each other 's main trading partner , but in the booming technology sector contact is limited .
nonillion , an up-and-coming it firm based in ghent , does not have a single customer in wallonia .
chief executive rudi van den bossche says french is not a requirement for his staff .
" most of our customers ask for bilingual - meaning dutch and english , " he says .
in brussels , on the other hand , bilingualism tends increasingly to be the norm .
still , the overall picture is one of division .
" if you were a martian and read the flemish newspapers and the walloon newspapers you would think they 're describing two different countries , " says de morgen 's yves desmet .
you say you want a revolution but does this continued estrangement mean that belgium is doomed ?
many commentators do not think so .

the capital is a region in its own right , distinct from both flanders and wallonia .
it is also richer than both , as well as the seat of the eu and nato .
as a result , neither side can accept a takeover of the other on brussels .

the status quo is thus the best option for both .
moreover , belgium 's proportional representation voting system is a big hurdle for those seeking radical change .

revolutions , copernican or otherwise , are mightily difficult to bring about in belgium .
muddling through according to dave sinardet , a political scientist at antwerp university , the fact that belgium 's communities lead largely separate lives , and have no great affection for each other , need not spell the end of the country .
flemish and walloons give their views on tensions in belgium in pictures " these things are also true of the european union and are not a problem for its continued existence , " he says .
this raises an interesting point about parallels between belgium and the eu .
the country was long regarded as a model for nations living in harmony under common institutions .
then , over the past year , the belgian stalemate was seen as a reflection of the eu 's divisions and the travails of its reform treaty .
the real parallel , however , may be neither rosy nor gloomy , but bitter-sweet .
in both belgium and the eu , shared institutions seem able to muddle through despite indifference from their constituent nations - rather like old couples who do n't talk but stay together because separation is more trouble than it is worth .
federalists both in belgium and europe might see this as too negative an argument for union - but it is a comfort of sorts .

belgium has launched a drive to reshape its institutions , following months of government paralysis .
at the heart of the crisis is a tension between the dutch-speaking flemish and francophones .
in the final of a series of articles , henri astier asks if belgium can remain united , and considers the lessons for other multi-ethnic entities .
flemish separatists are burning to tear up the belgian constitution earlier this month the flemish sports minister suggested restructuring belgium 's football federation , creating francophone and dutch-speaking wings .
the plan drew loud boos from french-speakers .
the vice-president of national champions standard liege called it as a " dangerous first step towards a split " - and threatened to make an even bigger step by joining the french league if it went ahead .
the row neatly encapsulates what some fear could be the unravelling of belgium itself .
the events might unfold along the following lines : the autonomy-minded flemish , who are richer and more numerous than french-speakers , grow impatient with protracted devolution talks ; in next year 's regional election flemish nationalists do well ; alarmed francophones seek solace in a union with france .
a recent poll by le soir newspaper suggested that 49 % of people in wallonia , the french-speaking half of belgium , want to become french if their country breaks up .
" there is a vicious circle where francophones feel that radicalisation is gathering pace in flanders , " says olivier mouton , le soir 's political editor .
" they brace themselves for flemish independence and become radicalised themselves . "
flemish copernicus the paradox is that separation would happen without either side actively seeking it .
only about 10 % of flemish voters want independence .
support for unity is overwhelming in wallonia .
for me the most important level will be the regional level kris peeters minister-president of flanders could belgians really be sleepwalking towards separation ?
flemish leaders say they only want to reform the belgian state , not dismantle it .
" i am not in favour of the independence , " kris peeters , flanders ' minister-president , told the bbc news website .
" solidarity " between flanders and other regions will remain , he insists .
however his stated goal is a " copernican revolution " where federal powers are greatly reduced and the main decisions taken by regions .

belgium has launched a drive to reshape its institutions , following months of government paralysis .
at the heart of the crisis is a tension between the dutch-speaking flemish and francophones .
in the final of a series of articles , henri astier asks if belgium can remain united , and considers the lessons for other multi-ethnic entities .
flemish separatists are burning to tear up the belgian constitution earlier this month the flemish sports minister suggested restructuring belgium 's football federation , creating francophone and dutch-speaking wings .
the plan drew loud boos from french-speakers .
the vice-president of national champions standard liege called it as a " dangerous first step towards a split " - and threatened to make an even bigger step by joining the french league if it went ahead .
the row neatly encapsulates what some fear could be the unravelling of belgium itself .
the events might unfold along the following lines : the autonomy-minded flemish , who are richer and more numerous than french-speakers , grow impatient with protracted devolution talks ; in next year 's regional election flemish nationalists do well ; alarmed francophones seek solace in a union with france .
a recent poll by le soir newspaper suggested that 49 % of people in wallonia , the french-speaking half of belgium , want to become french if their country breaks up .
" there is a vicious circle where francophones feel that radicalisation is gathering pace in flanders , " says olivier mouton , le soir 's political editor .
" they brace themselves for flemish independence and become radicalised themselves . "
flemish copernicus the paradox is that separation would happen without either side actively seeking it .
only about 10 % of flemish voters want independence .
support for unity is overwhelming in wallonia .
for me the most important level will be the regional level kris peeters minister-president of flanders could belgians really be sleepwalking towards separation ?
flemish leaders say they only want to reform the belgian state , not dismantle it .
" i am not in favour of the independence , " kris peeters , flanders ' minister-president , told the bbc news website .
" solidarity " between flanders and other regions will remain , he insists .
however his stated goal is a " copernican revolution " where federal powers are greatly reduced and the main decisions taken by regions .
" for me the most important level will be the regional level , " he says .
mr peeters ' career reflects this belief in the regions ' supremacy .
he spurned a seat in the belgian parliament .
asked what he would do if offered a key federal ministry he says unhesitatingly : " i would turn it down too . "
and his description of the current " dialogue between the communities " points to his ideal of quasi-sovereign entities : " we have two delegations , like two separate states discussing a treaty . "

called stories behind the stats aims to highlight the severity of the issue .
plaid cymru am nerys evans wants to start a national debate and the assembly government to fund a campaign to raise more awareness of the issue .
the assembly government said it was delivering a national strategy on domestic abuse , with by a £ 3.7m budget , a sevenfold increase on 2002 's funding .
in july , ms evans undertook a confidential survey where three welsh politicians admitted to being the victims of rape and one of domestic abuse .
the am for mid and west wales said that one in four women would suffer some kind of abuse in their lifetime simply because they were female .
" the first time you come across this statistic it is shocking but the more you hear it the less of an impact it has and the shock now disappears , " she said .
" but behind the stats are women with real life experiences of suffering violence and abuse purely because of their gender . "
the shocking thing is that it took politicians to speak out , albeit anonymously to get attention to the issue " nerys evans am " these are women from all types of background , professions , class , religion , ethnicity and age . "
she said the blog would demonstrate that domestic violence was happening across all communities and would encourage people to discuss what was still a taboo subject for many women .
it is the second part in her campaign to bring more attention to the issue after her survey of ams gained a lot of media interest .
ms evans revealed in july that she had surveyed all 60 ams and eight responded .
' many projects ' none of the three reported the rape and neither did the am who was the victim of domestic abuse .
" those stats are n't as shocking as they seem , they follow national trends and i suspect that there are more experiences with the assembly than the anonymous poll indicates , " said ms evans .
" the shocking thing is that it took politicians to speak out , albeit anonymously to get attention to the issue . "
ms evans said she hoped to open up the debate about domestic abuse and called on the assembly government to fund a campaign that would challenge attitudes towards it .
" abuse can take numerous forms : physical , emotional , psychological , and financial and it 's about time we opened up this debate and challenged the attitudes that exist , for the good of the whole of welsh society , " she said .
the assembly government said it was delivering a national strategy to tackle domestic abuse .
" funding for domestic abuse initiatives has increased sevenfold since 2002 and now stand at £ 3.7m , " said a spokesman .
" this funding currently supports many projects across wales , including a domestic abuse co-ordinator in every community safety partnership in wales . "
he said welsh women 's aid received funding of more than £ 1m a year from the domestic abuse budget , including funding for a freephone bilingual 24 hour helpline , and funding for peripatetic children 's workers , who provide additional support for young people affected by domestic abuse .

ms evans said she hoped to open up the debate about domestic abuse and called on the assembly government to fund a campaign that would challenge attitudes towards it .

the assembly government said it was delivering a national strategy to tackle domestic abuse .
" funding for domestic abuse initiatives has increased sevenfold since 2002 and now stand at £ 3.7m , " said a spokesman .
" this funding currently supports many projects across wales , including a domestic abuse co-ordinator in every community safety partnership in wales . "
he said welsh women 's aid received funding of more than £ 1m a year from the domestic abuse budget , including funding for a freephone bilingual 24 hour helpline , and funding for peripatetic children 's workers , who provide additional support for young people affected by domestic abuse .

the average age of death varied between 66 in easterhouse , glasgow , and 80 in eastbourne , sussex , the universities of bristol and sheffield found .
the study , called the grim reaper 's road map , analysed nearly 15 million deaths between 1981 and 2004 and mapped them according to age , place and cause .
authors said poverty and social mobility explained the variations .
researchers divided the uk into 1,282 neighbourhoods , each about the size of half a parliamentary constituency . "
this is not just about poverty .
poverty is part of it , but it 's also about people moving around the country to improve their health and wealth " danny dorling sheffield university within these areas they calculated an individual 's chance of dying from a particular cause in a particular place , compared to the national average for that cause of death .
researchers found the overall average age of death in the uk was 74.4 years - or 71.2 for men and 77.4 for women .
but in the most affluent areas , such as west eastbourne , this rose to 80.6 years and dropped to 66.4 in more deprived areas , such as glasgow 's easterhouse .
heart disease danny dorling , professor of geography at sheffield university and one of the report 's authors , said key factors in the regional variations were levels of wealth and people 's mobility .
" this is not just about poverty .
poverty is part of it , but it 's also about people moving around the country to improve their health and wealth , " he said .
" part of the reason east glasgow has such poor health is that it has one of the highest rates of out-migration .
" people who are able to do so , move out of the area to more affluent areas . "
the study , which also mapped deaths according to cause , found heart disease was behind more than a quarter of all deaths during the 25-year period analysed .
a clear north-south divide was discovered , with almost all neighbourhoods with the highest rates of the disease found in the north of england and west of scotland , particularly around glasgow .
there were also differences between the north and the south with regard to lung cancer , with clusters of cases found in liverpool , manchester , tyneside and central london .
age differences the study , dubbed the atlas of death , suggested these differences in life expectancy between richer and poorer areas were getting worse .
the mortality rate for those in the most deprived areas in 1981 was 20 % higher than the national average , but this rose to 50 % by 2004 , mr dorling said .
the number of people dying from violence , alcohol and suicide had also increased significantly between 1981 and 2004 , he added .
the report also shed light on the most common causes of death for different age groups .
transport-related accidents - such as on the roads - were found to be the biggest cause of death for those between the ages of 10 and 24 .
suicide and drugs became the biggest killers in urban britain for those in their 20s , while road accidents were the leading cause of death in the countryside at that age , researchers said .
people in their 30s were most likely to die from diseases , the study found .
however , the maps also showed some historical blips .
in two neighbourhoods in scotland , the greatest cause of death among five to nine year olds was found to be assault with a firearm .
this was put down to the 1996 dunblane massacre .
in addition , a cluster of lung cancer deaths was found in llandudno , north wales , which authors believed was likely to be because people with the disease were going there to recover .

the average age of death varied between 66 in easterhouse , glasgow , and 80 in eastbourne , sussex , the universities of bristol and sheffield found .
the study , called the grim reaper 's road map , analysed nearly 15 million deaths between 1981 and 2004 and mapped them according to age , place and cause .
authors said poverty and social mobility explained the variations .
researchers divided the uk into 1,282 neighbourhoods , each about the size of half a parliamentary constituency .
this is not just about poverty .
poverty is part of it , but it 's also about people moving around the country to improve their health and wealth danny dorling sheffield university within these areas they calculated an individual 's chance of dying from a particular cause in a particular place , compared to the national average for that cause of death .
researchers found the overall average age of death in the uk was 74.4 years - or 71.2 for men and 77.4 for women .
but in the most affluent areas , such as west eastbourne , this rose to 80.6 years and dropped to 66.4 in more deprived areas , such as glasgow 's easterhouse .
heart disease danny dorling , professor of geography at sheffield university and one of the report 's authors , said key factors in the regional variations were levels of wealth and people 's mobility .
" this is not just about poverty .
poverty is part of it , but it 's also about people moving around the country to improve their health and wealth , " he said .
" part of the reason east glasgow has such poor health is that it has one of the highest rates of out-migration .
" people who are able to do so , move out of the area to more affluent areas . "
the study , which also mapped deaths according to cause , found heart disease was behind more than a quarter of all deaths during the 25-year period analysed .
a clear north-south divide was discovered , with almost all neighbourhoods with the highest rates of the disease found in the north of england and west of scotland , particularly around glasgow .
there were also differences between the north and the south with regard to lung cancer , with clusters of cases found in liverpool , manchester , tyneside and central london .
age differences the study , dubbed the atlas of death , suggested these differences in life expectancy between richer and poorer areas were getting worse .
the mortality rate for those in the most deprived areas in 1981 was 20 % higher than the national average , but this rose to 50 % by 2004 , mr dorling said .
the number of people dying from violence , alcohol and suicide had also increased significantly between 1981 and 2004 , he added .
the report also shed light on the most common causes of death for different age groups .
transport-related accidents - such as on the roads - were found to be the biggest cause of death for those between the ages of 10 and 24 .
suicide and drugs became the biggest killers in urban britain for those in their 20s , while road accidents were the leading cause of death in the countryside at that age , researchers said .
people in their 30s were most likely to die from diseases , the study found .
however , the maps also showed some historical blips .
in two neighbourhoods in scotland , the greatest cause of death among five to nine year olds was found to be assault with a firearm .
this was put down to the 1996 dunblane massacre .
in addition , a cluster of lung cancer deaths was found in llandudno , north wales , which authors believed was likely to be because people with the disease were going there to recover .

there were also differences between the north and the south with regard to lung cancer , with clusters of cases found in liverpool , manchester , tyneside and central london .
age differences the study , dubbed the atlas of death , suggested these differences in life expectancy between richer and poorer areas were getting worse .
the mortality rate for those in the most deprived areas in 1981 was 20 % higher than the national average , but this rose to 50 % by 2004 , mr dorling said .
the number of people dying from violence , alcohol and suicide had also increased significantly between 1981 and 2004 , he added .
the report also shed light on the most common causes of death for different age groups .
transport-related accidents - such as on the roads - were found to be the biggest cause of death for those between the ages of 10 and 24 .
suicide and drugs became the biggest killers in urban britain for those in their 20s , while road accidents were the leading cause of death in the countryside at that age , researchers said .
people in their 30s were most likely to die from diseases , the study found .
however , the maps also showed some historical blips .
in two neighbourhoods in scotland , the greatest cause of death among five to nine year olds was found to be assault with a firearm .
this was put down to the 1996 dunblane massacre .
in addition , a cluster of lung cancer deaths was found in llandudno , north wales , which authors believed was likely to be because people with the disease were going there to recover .

the average age of death varied between 66 in easterhouse , glasgow , and 80 in eastbourne , sussex , the universities of bristol and sheffield found .
the study , called the grim reaper 's road map , analysed nearly 15 million deaths between 1981 and 2004 and mapped them according to age , place and cause .
authors said poverty and social mobility explained the variations .
researchers divided the uk into 1,282 neighbourhoods , each about the size of half a parliamentary constituency .
this is not just about poverty .
poverty is part of it , but it 's also about people moving around the country to improve their health and wealth danny dorling sheffield university within these areas they calculated an individual 's chance of dying from a particular cause in a particular place , compared to the national average for that cause of death .
researchers found the overall average age of death in the uk was 74.4 years - or 71.2 for men and 77.4 for women .
but in the most affluent areas , such as west eastbourne , this rose to 80.6 years and dropped to 66.4 in more deprived areas , such as glasgow 's easterhouse .
heart disease danny dorling , professor of geography at sheffield university and one of the report 's authors , said key factors in the regional variations were levels of wealth and people 's mobility .
" this is not just about poverty .
poverty is part of it , but it 's also about people moving around the country to improve their health and wealth , " he said .
" part of the reason east glasgow has such poor health is that it has one of the highest rates of out-migration .

advertisement live cctv launched on buses a six-month trial of live cctv on a london bus route has begun .
london mayor boris johnson announced that the technology had been installed on 21 double-decker buses on a north london route .
the real-time images will be beamed to a control room manned by transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- and police .
the trial will be monitored to determine whether live images can help transport staff deal with disorder more effectively .
mr johnson said : " i am determined to banish the sad minority of hoodlums and trouble makers that have blighted our buses .
" having the facility to access live pictures from buses travelling around the capital will mean our bus controllers can play a far more effective role in sending police officers to sort out troublemakers .
" if this trial is successful then we will consider rolling out the system on other routes as part of our campaign to stamp out the casual disorder that led to a culture of fear on public transport . "
andy thompson , of london buses , said : " while crime is low on london buses , we know there is more to do , which is why we are always looking at ways to improve safety , and our passengers ' perception of safety , while they travel on our network . "

advertisement live cctv launched on buses a six-month trial of live cctv on a london bus route has begun .
london mayor boris johnson announced that the technology had been installed on 21 double-decker buses on a north london route .
the real-time images will be beamed to a control room manned by transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- and police .
the trial will be monitored to determine whether live images can help transport staff deal with disorder more effectively .
mr johnson said : " i am determined to banish the sad minority of hoodlums and trouble makers that have blighted our buses .
" having the facility to access live pictures from buses travelling around the capital will mean our bus controllers can play a far more effective role in sending police officers to sort out troublemakers .
" if this trial is successful then we will consider rolling out the system on other routes as part of our campaign to stamp out the casual disorder that led to a culture of fear on public transport . "
andy thompson , of london buses , said : " while crime is low on london buses , we know there is more to do , which is why we are always looking at ways to improve safety , and our passengers ' perception of safety , while they travel on our network . "
currently there are 60,000 recordable cctv cameras operating on the 8,000 london buses .

more then 2,000 savers in stricken landsbanki guernsey have been told they should get only 30p for every £ 1 held , with the prospect of more to come .
concerns have been raised that the islands ' reputation as a finance centre could be tarnished because of the lack of an appropriate protection scheme .
ten deputies are lobbying for a protection scheme as soon as possible .
the bank 's administrators , deloitte , said that of the £ 121m deposited in landsbanki guernsey , just £ 41m was available for distribution to savers .
about half of the depositors live in guernsey and jersey , with 455 savers living in the uk .
deloitte has said that because guernsey has no depositor protection scheme , savers would be reliant on the governments of guernsey , britain and iceland to make up any shortfall as a goodwill gesture , but there was no guarantee of that .

more then 2,000 savers in stricken landsbanki guernsey have been told they should get only 30p for every £ 1 held , with the prospect of more to come .
concerns have been raised that the islands ' reputation as a finance centre could be tarnished because of the lack of an appropriate protection scheme .
ten deputies are lobbying for a protection scheme as soon as possible .
the bank 's administrators , deloitte , said that of the £ 121m deposited in landsbanki guernsey , just £ 41m was available for distribution to savers .
about half of the depositors live in guernsey and jersey , with 455 savers living in the uk .
deloitte has said that because guernsey has no depositor protection scheme , savers would be reliant on the governments of guernsey , britain and iceland to make up any shortfall as a goodwill gesture , but there was no guarantee of that .

up to 10,000 people are believed to have £ 840m deposited in the manx kaupthing singer and friedlander -lrb- ksf -rrb- .
depositors believe the uk government 's freezing of icelandic assets led to the manx subsidiary 's collapse .
they are calling for the same 100 % guarantee on their money that has been given to savers in uk subsidiaries .
the manx financial supervision commission -lrb- fsc -rrb- suspended the bank 's licence on 8 october after its parent bank kaupthing was nationalised , and its uk assets were frozen .
we are the prudent savers , we are the ones that should be applauded for being responsible with our savings stephen thomas , depositor the icelandic bank had issued a parental guarantee in september 2007 to take responsibility for the liabilities , including deposits , of its manx subsidiary .
but although the uk government - which is responsible for representing the island in international matters - said british savers were protected , it has so far failed to guarantee money in offshore accounts .
angry savers have signed a petition which states their belief that the governments of the uk , iceland and the isle of man " acted irresponsibly , unfairly and in a discriminatory manner towards depositors " .
they want gordon brown to confirm in a statement that treasury officials are " seeking the return of 100 % of all deposits held within ksf -lrb- isle of man -rrb- " .
the petition says : " the uk government 's actions in freezing icelandic assets in the uk directly led to the failure and subsequent administration of kaupthing singer & friedlander uk -lrb- ksf uk -rrb- which up to then had been a solvent and liquid entity . "
members of the kaupthing isle of man depositors action group were gathering in parliament square in london on monday to present the petition to the uk government .
copies will also be given to iceland and isle of man officials .
' legal limbo ' although ksf -lrb- isle of man -rrb- was an offshore bank , many of the depositors were british citizens working overseas who found it difficult to open a uk bank account without a domestic address .
group spokesman stephen thomas , 57 , had £ 750,000 deposited in the bank after selling his house and was about to move back to the uk from moscow , where he had been living for a number of years .
he said : " what is really annoying to thousands of savers is that gordon brown keeps talking of prudence , protecting savers and responsible actions by institutions .
" we are the prudent savers , we are the ones that should be applauded for being responsible with our savings , not thrown into legal limbo by an action that we should not be a part of .
" again i wish to state , we deposited our monies in an a + listed , solvent bank on the isle of man .
why are we being penalised for being responsible and prudent people ? "
a court hearing on friday will decide whether ksf -lrb- isle of man -rrb- is formally wound-up .

up to 10,000 people are believed to have £ 840m deposited in the manx kaupthing singer and friedlander -lrb- ksf -rrb- .
depositors believe the uk government 's freezing of icelandic assets led to the manx subsidiary 's collapse .
they are calling for the same 100 % guarantee on their money that has been given to savers in uk subsidiaries .
the manx financial supervision commission -lrb- fsc -rrb- suspended the bank 's licence on 8 october after its parent bank kaupthing was nationalised , and its uk assets were frozen .
we are the prudent savers , we are the ones that should be applauded for being responsible with our savings stephen thomas , depositor the icelandic bank had issued a parental guarantee in september 2007 to take responsibility for the liabilities , including deposits , of its manx subsidiary .
but although the uk government - which is responsible for representing the island in international matters - said british savers were protected , it has so far failed to guarantee money in offshore accounts .
angry savers have signed a petition which states their belief that the governments of the uk , iceland and the isle of man " acted irresponsibly , unfairly and in a discriminatory manner towards depositors " .
they want gordon brown to confirm in a statement that treasury officials are " seeking the return of 100 % of all deposits held within ksf -lrb- isle of man -rrb- " .
the petition says : " the uk government 's actions in freezing icelandic assets in the uk directly led to the failure and subsequent administration of kaupthing singer & friedlander uk -lrb- ksf uk -rrb- which up to then had been a solvent and liquid entity . "
members of the kaupthing isle of man depositors action group were gathering in parliament square in london on monday to present the petition to the uk government .
copies will also be given to iceland and isle of man officials .
' legal limbo ' although ksf -lrb- isle of man -rrb- was an offshore bank , many of the depositors were british citizens working overseas who found it difficult to open a uk bank account without a domestic address .
group spokesman stephen thomas , 57 , had £ 750,000 deposited in the bank after selling his house and was about to move back to the uk from moscow , where he had been living for a number of years .
he said : " what is really annoying to thousands of savers is that gordon brown keeps talking of prudence , protecting savers and responsible actions by institutions .
" we are the prudent savers , we are the ones that should be applauded for being responsible with our savings , not thrown into legal limbo by an action that we should not be a part of .
" again i wish to state , we deposited our monies in an a + listed , solvent bank on the isle of man .
why are we being penalised for being responsible and prudent people ? "
a court hearing on friday will decide whether ksf -lrb- isle of man -rrb- is formally wound-up .
