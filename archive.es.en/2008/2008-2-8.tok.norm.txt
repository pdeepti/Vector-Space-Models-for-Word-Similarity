the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .
blaze stokes tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women with headscarves gaze at the building where the fire broke out tensions between germans and turks were fuelled last week by a fire in a housing block in the german city of ludwigshafen , killing nine people of turkish origin .
the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .
the blaze has stirred memories of a firebombing by germans in 1993 in the town of solingen which killed five turks .
erdogan visited the site this week and met with survivors .
he has called on police to clear up the case swiftly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but no one wants to see the country fail , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was the usual game : before nearly every important nato meeting , the us and the other countries involved militarily in southern and eastern afghanistan put pressure on the rest of the nato members to send more troops . the german government then refuses once again to send bundeswehr soldiers to the more hostile south and tensions rise before the meeting . during the talks , however , things are usually not half as bad as expected .
and that 's how it turned out this time , too . us downplays demand for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the defense ministers ' meeting in vilnius , everyone agreed that nato as a whole has to do more in afghanistan .
us secretary of defense robert gates said that the evil media had exaggerated everything and he had just sent a cordial letter to all his fellow ministers - not only to the german defense minister . the pentagon chief suddenly showed understanding for the difficulties of coalition governments , like the one in berlin made up of conservatives and social democrats . even though tensions may have eased , the problem remains . nato still does n't have the additional troops for afghanistan that the military leaders wanted .
the tedious search for willing contributors will continue . who is willing to go ? german defense minister franz-josef jung got surprised reactions when he said that france , poland and romania would fill the gap with several thousand soldiers .
no one had heard about that except for him - an embarrassing misunderstanding . once again , vilnius demonstrated the attitude that the danish defense minister had put into words : if we wanted to , we could . the nato states have the means , but are lacking the political will . germany must discuss whether it 's ready to send more soldiers into the hot-spots in hindu kush .
the government wo n't be able to explain to its allies much longer why the germans are so poshly reserved when it comes to dangerous combat . other countries like italy and spain do the same thing , but they are also criticized for it .
the dutch and canadians are justified in asking , why us and not you , too ? no immediate crisis for nato nevertheless , nato is not about to split or even collapse .
despite all the disagreements over division of labor , one thing is clear : the afghanistan mission can not fail . the international community ca n't afford another failed state in this sensitive region .
that 's just what the taliban , al qaeda , and co. are waiting for . bernd riegert is a dw-radio correspondent in brussels . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .

the 23-year-old told a court he opposed the use of violence against citizens . youssef al-hajj dib is on trial in the western german city of düsseldorf for his role in a botched train bombing attempt in july of 2006 .
" i 'm happy that at the last moment i was able to prevent innocent victims from dying , " al-hajj dib told the court , where he is on trial on multiple counts of attempted murder .
he has not been charged with belonging to a terrorist organization .
al-hajj dib said his co-conspirator , jihad hammad , 22 , incited him to join the train bombing plot .
hamad is serving 12 years in prison after being convicted by a beruit court .
wanted to send a warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombers said they did n't mean for the suitcases to explode according to al-hajj dib , hammad told him it was their duty to kill citizens .
during the beruit trial , hammad admitted in court that the action had been a protest against caricatures of the prophet mohammed published by a danish newspaper .
hammad used verses from the koran and religious opinions to back up this view , al-hajj dib said .
" i was unable to contradict him , but my heart told me it was not quite right what we were doing , " the accused said .
" i believed in jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- and was against the us presence in iraq , but also opposed the use of violence against civilians . "
at the lebanese court hearing , hammad said the opposite .
he claimed that al-hajj dib thought up the plan and persuaded him to go along with it .
the two men built bombs using designs they found on the internet .
they placed the bombs in suitcases and went together to the train station in cologne on july 31 , 2006 .
the trains headed in opposite directions with the bombs on board .
german police said the men assembled the bombs incorrectly , which is why they failed to go off .
if they had exploded , it 's estimated that hundreds of people would 've been killed .
al-hajj dib was identified with the help of surveillance footage from the cologne airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan gates presses europeans to back afghan mission germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens afghanistan -pipe- 08.02.2008 opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nato members are calling for more troops in southern afghanistan , while the germans want to stay comfortably in the north .
but no one wants to see the country fail , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was the usual game : before nearly every important nato meeting , the us and the other countries involved militarily in southern and eastern afghanistan put pressure on the rest of the nato members to send more troops . the german government then refuses once again to send bundeswehr soldiers to the more hostile south and tensions rise before the meeting . during the talks , however , things are usually not half as bad as expected .
and that 's how it turned out this time , too . us downplays demand for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the defense ministers ' meeting in vilnius , everyone agreed that nato as a whole has to do more in afghanistan .
us secretary of defense robert gates said that the evil media had exaggerated everything and he had just sent a cordial letter to all his fellow ministers - not only to the german defense minister . the pentagon chief suddenly showed understanding for the difficulties of coalition governments , like the one in berlin made up of conservatives and social democrats . even though tensions may have eased , the problem remains . nato still does n't have the additional troops for afghanistan that the military leaders wanted .
the tedious search for willing contributors will continue . who is willing to go ? german defense minister franz-josef jung got surprised reactions when he said that france , poland and romania would fill the gap with several thousand soldiers .
no one had heard about that except for him - an embarrassing misunderstanding . once again , vilnius demonstrated the attitude that the danish defense minister had put into words : if we wanted to , we could . the nato states have the means , but are lacking the political will . germany must discuss whether it 's ready to send more soldiers into the hot-spots in hindu kush .
the government wo n't be able to explain to its allies much longer why the germans are so poshly reserved when it comes to dangerous combat . other countries like italy and spain do the same thing , but they are also criticized for it .
the dutch and canadians are justified in asking , why us and not you , too ? no immediate crisis for nato nevertheless , nato is not about to split or even collapse .
despite all the disagreements over division of labor , one thing is clear : the afghanistan mission can not fail . the international community ca n't afford another failed state in this sensitive region .
that 's just what the taliban , al qaeda , and co. are waiting for . bernd riegert is a dw-radio correspondent in brussels . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .

but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .

it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .

the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .

aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .

the 23-year-old told a court he opposed the use of violence against citizens . youssef al-hajj dib is on trial in the western german city of düsseldorf for his role in a botched train bombing attempt in july of 2006 .
" i 'm happy that at the last moment i was able to prevent innocent victims from dying , " al-hajj dib told the court , where he is on trial on multiple counts of attempted murder .
he has not been charged with belonging to a terrorist organization .
al-hajj dib said his co-conspirator , jihad hammad , 22 , incited him to join the train bombing plot .
hamad is serving 12 years in prison after being convicted by a beruit court .
wanted to send a warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombers said they did n't mean for the suitcases to explode according to al-hajj dib , hammad told him it was their duty to kill citizens .
during the beruit trial , hammad admitted in court that the action had been a protest against caricatures of the prophet mohammed published by a danish newspaper .
hammad used verses from the koran and religious opinions to back up this view , al-hajj dib said .
" i was unable to contradict him , but my heart told me it was not quite right what we were doing , " the accused said .
" i believed in jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- and was against the us presence in iraq , but also opposed the use of violence against civilians . "
at the lebanese court hearing , hammad said the opposite .
he claimed that al-hajj dib thought up the plan and persuaded him to go along with it .
the two men built bombs using designs they found on the internet .
they placed the bombs in suitcases and went together to the train station in cologne on july 31 , 2006 .
the trains headed in opposite directions with the bombs on board .
german police said the men assembled the bombs incorrectly , which is why they failed to go off .
if they had exploded , it 's estimated that hundreds of people would 've been killed .
al-hajj dib was identified with the help of surveillance footage from the cologne airport .
he was arrested at kiel railway station in northern germany as he prepared to leave the country . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .
blaze stokes tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women with headscarves gaze at the building where the fire broke out tensions between germans and turks were fuelled last week by a fire in a housing block in the german city of ludwigshafen , killing nine people of turkish origin .
the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .
the blaze has stirred memories of a firebombing by germans in 1993 in the town of solingen which killed five turks .
erdogan visited the site this week and met with survivors .
he has called on police to clear up the case swiftly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .

" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .

but no one wants to see the country fail , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was the usual game : before nearly every important nato meeting , the us and the other countries involved militarily in southern and eastern afghanistan put pressure on the rest of the nato members to send more troops . the german government then refuses once again to send bundeswehr soldiers to the more hostile south and tensions rise before the meeting . during the talks , however , things are usually not half as bad as expected .
and that 's how it turned out this time , too . us downplays demand for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the defense ministers ' meeting in vilnius , everyone agreed that nato as a whole has to do more in afghanistan .
us secretary of defense robert gates said that the evil media had exaggerated everything and he had just sent a cordial letter to all his fellow ministers - not only to the german defense minister . the pentagon chief suddenly showed understanding for the difficulties of coalition governments , like the one in berlin made up of conservatives and social democrats . even though tensions may have eased , the problem remains . nato still does n't have the additional troops for afghanistan that the military leaders wanted .
the tedious search for willing contributors will continue . who is willing to go ? german defense minister franz-josef jung got surprised reactions when he said that france , poland and romania would fill the gap with several thousand soldiers .
no one had heard about that except for him - an embarrassing misunderstanding . once again , vilnius demonstrated the attitude that the danish defense minister had put into words : if we wanted to , we could . the nato states have the means , but are lacking the political will . germany must discuss whether it 's ready to send more soldiers into the hot-spots in hindu kush .
the government wo n't be able to explain to its allies much longer why the germans are so poshly reserved when it comes to dangerous combat . other countries like italy and spain do the same thing , but they are also criticized for it .
the dutch and canadians are justified in asking , why us and not you , too ? no immediate crisis for nato nevertheless , nato is not about to split or even collapse .
despite all the disagreements over division of labor , one thing is clear : the afghanistan mission can not fail . the international community ca n't afford another failed state in this sensitive region .
that 's just what the taliban , al qaeda , and co. are waiting for . bernd riegert is a dw-radio correspondent in brussels . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .
blaze stokes tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women with headscarves gaze at the building where the fire broke out tensions between germans and turks were fuelled last week by a fire in a housing block in the german city of ludwigshafen , killing nine people of turkish origin .
the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .
the blaze has stirred memories of a firebombing by germans in 1993 in the town of solingen which killed five turks .
erdogan visited the site this week and met with survivors .
he has called on police to clear up the case swiftly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bhutto 's pakistan people 's party has rejected the findings . the keenly-awaited 70-page report by british detectives shows that benazir bhutto died from a head injury caused by the force of the bomb blast in rawalpindi on dec .
27 , 2007 .
“ the scotland yard report establishes three things , ” the caretaker interior minister hamid nawaz said .
“ the first thing is that the only injury on the right side of her head was not caused by a bullet .
secondly , the one who fired and the suicide bomber were the same person .
thirdly , with the force of the bomb she collided with the vehicle .
these are the three things the report establishes . ”
but bhutto ’ s pakistan people ’ s party , or ppp , immediately rejected the conclusion drawn by the british detectives , insisting she was killed by the assassin ’ s bullet .
rejecting the report ppp leader , sherry rehman , who was with bhutto at the time of attack and survived the blast , is angry : “ we disagree with this finding but we have co-operated with them -lsb- the detectives -rsb- and we would look at the report in depth .
more importantly we will continue to ask for an international probe at the united nations level .
the report supports the version of president musharraf ’ s government that effectively holds bhutto responsible for her death by saying she was negligent about her security .
bhutto was standing in an open-roofed vehicle when she was killed .
scotland yard ’ s report has also stirred up a debate about the whole role of the british detectives in pakistan .
the detectives didn ’ t examine the body of benazir bhutto and vital evidence was not available because the crime scene was cleaned up with hoses within hours .
not much faith left “ the political parties , civil society , the lawyers and intelligentsia don ’ t have much faith left in the government , ” explained riaz khokar , an independent political analyst .
“ i am not so sure that the scotland yard report will smoothen anything . ”

bhutto 's pakistan people 's party has rejected the findings . the keenly-awaited 70-page report by british detectives shows that benazir bhutto died from a head injury caused by the force of the bomb blast in rawalpindi on dec .
27 , 2007 .
“ the scotland yard report establishes three things , ” the caretaker interior minister hamid nawaz said .
“ the first thing is that the only injury on the right side of her head was not caused by a bullet .
secondly , the one who fired and the suicide bomber were the same person .
thirdly , with the force of the bomb she collided with the vehicle .
these are the three things the report establishes . ”
but bhutto ’ s pakistan people ’ s party , or ppp , immediately rejected the conclusion drawn by the british detectives , insisting she was killed by the assassin ’ s bullet .
rejecting the report ppp leader , sherry rehman , who was with bhutto at the time of attack and survived the blast , is angry : “ we disagree with this finding but we have co-operated with them -lsb- the detectives -rsb- and we would look at the report in depth .
more importantly we will continue to ask for an international probe at the united nations level .
the report supports the version of president musharraf ’ s government that effectively holds bhutto responsible for her death by saying she was negligent about her security .
bhutto was standing in an open-roofed vehicle when she was killed .
scotland yard ’ s report has also stirred up a debate about the whole role of the british detectives in pakistan .
the detectives didn ’ t examine the body of benazir bhutto and vital evidence was not available because the crime scene was cleaned up with hoses within hours .
not much faith left “ the political parties , civil society , the lawyers and intelligentsia don ’ t have much faith left in the government , ” explained riaz khokar , an independent political analyst .
“ i am not so sure that the scotland yard report will smoothen anything . ”
“ there is also a feeling that united states and britain want to bail out this government .
there is a lot of negative feeling about the overall approach of the government to this particular case . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .
blaze stokes tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women with headscarves gaze at the building where the fire broke out tensions between germans and turks were fuelled last week by a fire in a housing block in the german city of ludwigshafen , killing nine people of turkish origin .
the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .
the blaze has stirred memories of a firebombing by germans in 1993 in the town of solingen which killed five turks .
erdogan visited the site this week and met with survivors .
he has called on police to clear up the case swiftly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.02.2008 chad president calls on eu to send peacekeeping force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what role have french troops played in the conflict ?
an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .

on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .

right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .

politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .

he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .

" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.02.2008 chad president calls on eu to send peacekeeping force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what role have french troops played in the conflict ?
an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 23-year-old told a court he opposed the use of violence against citizens . youssef al-hajj dib is on trial in the western german city of düsseldorf for his role in a botched train bombing attempt in july of 2006 .
" i 'm happy that at the last moment i was able to prevent innocent victims from dying , " al-hajj dib told the court , where he is on trial on multiple counts of attempted murder .
he has not been charged with belonging to a terrorist organization .
al-hajj dib said his co-conspirator , jihad hammad , 22 , incited him to join the train bombing plot .
hamad is serving 12 years in prison after being convicted by a beruit court .
wanted to send a warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombers said they did n't mean for the suitcases to explode according to al-hajj dib , hammad told him it was their duty to kill citizens .
during the beruit trial , hammad admitted in court that the action had been a protest against caricatures of the prophet mohammed published by a danish newspaper .
hammad used verses from the koran and religious opinions to back up this view , al-hajj dib said .
" i was unable to contradict him , but my heart told me it was not quite right what we were doing , " the accused said .
" i believed in jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- and was against the us presence in iraq , but also opposed the use of violence against civilians . "
at the lebanese court hearing , hammad said the opposite .
he claimed that al-hajj dib thought up the plan and persuaded him to go along with it .
the two men built bombs using designs they found on the internet .

the 23-year-old told a court he opposed the use of violence against citizens . youssef al-hajj dib is on trial in the western german city of düsseldorf for his role in a botched train bombing attempt in july of 2006 .
" i 'm happy that at the last moment i was able to prevent innocent victims from dying , " al-hajj dib told the court , where he is on trial on multiple counts of attempted murder .
he has not been charged with belonging to a terrorist organization .
al-hajj dib said his co-conspirator , jihad hammad , 22 , incited him to join the train bombing plot .
hamad is serving 12 years in prison after being convicted by a beruit court .
wanted to send a warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombers said they did n't mean for the suitcases to explode according to al-hajj dib , hammad told him it was their duty to kill citizens .
during the beruit trial , hammad admitted in court that the action had been a protest against caricatures of the prophet mohammed published by a danish newspaper .
hammad used verses from the koran and religious opinions to back up this view , al-hajj dib said .
" i was unable to contradict him , but my heart told me it was not quite right what we were doing , " the accused said .
" i believed in jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- and was against the us presence in iraq , but also opposed the use of violence against civilians . "
at the lebanese court hearing , hammad said the opposite .
he claimed that al-hajj dib thought up the plan and persuaded him to go along with it .
the two men built bombs using designs they found on the internet .
they placed the bombs in suitcases and went together to the train station in cologne on july 31 , 2006 .

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .

the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .

the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .

the 23-year-old told a court he opposed the use of violence against citizens . youssef al-hajj dib is on trial in the western german city of düsseldorf for his role in a botched train bombing attempt in july of 2006 .
" i 'm happy that at the last moment i was able to prevent innocent victims from dying , " al-hajj dib told the court , where he is on trial on multiple counts of attempted murder .
he has not been charged with belonging to a terrorist organization .
al-hajj dib said his co-conspirator , jihad hammad , 22 , incited him to join the train bombing plot .
hamad is serving 12 years in prison after being convicted by a beruit court .
wanted to send a warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombers said they did n't mean for the suitcases to explode according to al-hajj dib , hammad told him it was their duty to kill citizens .
during the beruit trial , hammad admitted in court that the action had been a protest against caricatures of the prophet mohammed published by a danish newspaper .
hammad used verses from the koran and religious opinions to back up this view , al-hajj dib said .
" i was unable to contradict him , but my heart told me it was not quite right what we were doing , " the accused said .
" i believed in jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- and was against the us presence in iraq , but also opposed the use of violence against civilians . "
at the lebanese court hearing , hammad said the opposite .
he claimed that al-hajj dib thought up the plan and persuaded him to go along with it .
the two men built bombs using designs they found on the internet .
they placed the bombs in suitcases and went together to the train station in cologne on july 31 , 2006 .
the trains headed in opposite directions with the bombs on board .
german police said the men assembled the bombs incorrectly , which is why they failed to go off .
if they had exploded , it 's estimated that hundreds of people would 've been killed .
al-hajj dib was identified with the help of surveillance footage from the cologne airport .
he was arrested at kiel railway station in northern germany as he prepared to leave the country . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but no one wants to see the country fail , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was the usual game : before nearly every important nato meeting , the us and the other countries involved militarily in southern and eastern afghanistan put pressure on the rest of the nato members to send more troops . the german government then refuses once again to send bundeswehr soldiers to the more hostile south and tensions rise before the meeting . during the talks , however , things are usually not half as bad as expected .
and that 's how it turned out this time , too . us downplays demand for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the defense ministers ' meeting in vilnius , everyone agreed that nato as a whole has to do more in afghanistan .
us secretary of defense robert gates said that the evil media had exaggerated everything and he had just sent a cordial letter to all his fellow ministers - not only to the german defense minister . the pentagon chief suddenly showed understanding for the difficulties of coalition governments , like the one in berlin made up of conservatives and social democrats . even though tensions may have eased , the problem remains . nato still does n't have the additional troops for afghanistan that the military leaders wanted .
the tedious search for willing contributors will continue . who is willing to go ? german defense minister franz-josef jung got surprised reactions when he said that france , poland and romania would fill the gap with several thousand soldiers .

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.02.2008 ignoring the public , french parliament approves eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public wanted a referendum , but did n't get one this time the french parliament friday approved the european union 's new reform treaty , nearly three years after rebellious french voters torpedoed the eu 's constitution .
this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .
only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the new text before the electorate in a referendum . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .
blaze stokes tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women with headscarves gaze at the building where the fire broke out tensions between germans and turks were fuelled last week by a fire in a housing block in the german city of ludwigshafen , killing nine people of turkish origin .
the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .
the blaze has stirred memories of a firebombing by germans in 1993 in the town of solingen which killed five turks .
erdogan visited the site this week and met with survivors .

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .
blaze stokes tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women with headscarves gaze at the building where the fire broke out tensions between germans and turks were fuelled last week by a fire in a housing block in the german city of ludwigshafen , killing nine people of turkish origin .
the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .
the blaze has stirred memories of a firebombing by germans in 1993 in the town of solingen which killed five turks .
erdogan visited the site this week and met with survivors .
he has called on police to clear up the case swiftly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.02.2008 czech presidential race pits past against future , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the guards at prague 's presidential palace salute klaus or svejnar after friday ?
dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan gates presses europeans to back afghan mission germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens afghanistan -pipe- 08.02.2008 opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nato members are calling for more troops in southern afghanistan , while the germans want to stay comfortably in the north .
but no one wants to see the country fail , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was the usual game : before nearly every important nato meeting , the us and the other countries involved militarily in southern and eastern afghanistan put pressure on the rest of the nato members to send more troops . the german government then refuses once again to send bundeswehr soldiers to the more hostile south and tensions rise before the meeting . during the talks , however , things are usually not half as bad as expected .
and that 's how it turned out this time , too . us downplays demand for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the defense ministers ' meeting in vilnius , everyone agreed that nato as a whole has to do more in afghanistan .
us secretary of defense robert gates said that the evil media had exaggerated everything and he had just sent a cordial letter to all his fellow ministers - not only to the german defense minister . the pentagon chief suddenly showed understanding for the difficulties of coalition governments , like the one in berlin made up of conservatives and social democrats . even though tensions may have eased , the problem remains . nato still does n't have the additional troops for afghanistan that the military leaders wanted .
the tedious search for willing contributors will continue . who is willing to go ? german defense minister franz-josef jung got surprised reactions when he said that france , poland and romania would fill the gap with several thousand soldiers .
no one had heard about that except for him - an embarrassing misunderstanding . once again , vilnius demonstrated the attitude that the danish defense minister had put into words : if we wanted to , we could . the nato states have the means , but are lacking the political will . germany must discuss whether it 's ready to send more soldiers into the hot-spots in hindu kush .
the government wo n't be able to explain to its allies much longer why the germans are so poshly reserved when it comes to dangerous combat . other countries like italy and spain do the same thing , but they are also criticized for it .
the dutch and canadians are justified in asking , why us and not you , too ? no immediate crisis for nato nevertheless , nato is not about to split or even collapse .
despite all the disagreements over division of labor , one thing is clear : the afghanistan mission can not fail . the international community ca n't afford another failed state in this sensitive region .
that 's just what the taliban , al qaeda , and co. are waiting for . bernd riegert is a dw-radio correspondent in brussels . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.02.2008 ignoring the public , french parliament approves eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public wanted a referendum , but did n't get one this time the french parliament friday approved the european union 's new reform treaty , nearly three years after rebellious french voters torpedoed the eu 's constitution .
this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .
blaze stokes tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women with headscarves gaze at the building where the fire broke out tensions between germans and turks were fuelled last week by a fire in a housing block in the german city of ludwigshafen , killing nine people of turkish origin .
the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .
the blaze has stirred memories of a firebombing by germans in 1993 in the town of solingen which killed five turks .
erdogan visited the site this week and met with survivors .
he has called on police to clear up the case swiftly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan gates presses europeans to back afghan mission germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens afghanistan -pipe- 08.02.2008 opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nato members are calling for more troops in southern afghanistan , while the germans want to stay comfortably in the north .
but no one wants to see the country fail , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was the usual game : before nearly every important nato meeting , the us and the other countries involved militarily in southern and eastern afghanistan put pressure on the rest of the nato members to send more troops . the german government then refuses once again to send bundeswehr soldiers to the more hostile south and tensions rise before the meeting . during the talks , however , things are usually not half as bad as expected .
and that 's how it turned out this time , too . us downplays demand for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the defense ministers ' meeting in vilnius , everyone agreed that nato as a whole has to do more in afghanistan .
us secretary of defense robert gates said that the evil media had exaggerated everything and he had just sent a cordial letter to all his fellow ministers - not only to the german defense minister . the pentagon chief suddenly showed understanding for the difficulties of coalition governments , like the one in berlin made up of conservatives and social democrats . even though tensions may have eased , the problem remains . nato still does n't have the additional troops for afghanistan that the military leaders wanted .
the tedious search for willing contributors will continue . who is willing to go ? german defense minister franz-josef jung got surprised reactions when he said that france , poland and romania would fill the gap with several thousand soldiers .
no one had heard about that except for him - an embarrassing misunderstanding . once again , vilnius demonstrated the attitude that the danish defense minister had put into words : if we wanted to , we could . the nato states have the means , but are lacking the political will . germany must discuss whether it 's ready to send more soldiers into the hot-spots in hindu kush .
the government wo n't be able to explain to its allies much longer why the germans are so poshly reserved when it comes to dangerous combat . other countries like italy and spain do the same thing , but they are also criticized for it .
the dutch and canadians are justified in asking , why us and not you , too ? no immediate crisis for nato nevertheless , nato is not about to split or even collapse .
despite all the disagreements over division of labor , one thing is clear : the afghanistan mission can not fail . the international community ca n't afford another failed state in this sensitive region .
that 's just what the taliban , al qaeda , and co. are waiting for . bernd riegert is a dw-radio correspondent in brussels . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 23-year-old told a court he opposed the use of violence against citizens . youssef al-hajj dib is on trial in the western german city of düsseldorf for his role in a botched train bombing attempt in july of 2006 .
" i 'm happy that at the last moment i was able to prevent innocent victims from dying , " al-hajj dib told the court , where he is on trial on multiple counts of attempted murder .
he has not been charged with belonging to a terrorist organization .
al-hajj dib said his co-conspirator , jihad hammad , 22 , incited him to join the train bombing plot .
hamad is serving 12 years in prison after being convicted by a beruit court .
wanted to send a warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombers said they did n't mean for the suitcases to explode according to al-hajj dib , hammad told him it was their duty to kill citizens .
during the beruit trial , hammad admitted in court that the action had been a protest against caricatures of the prophet mohammed published by a danish newspaper .
hammad used verses from the koran and religious opinions to back up this view , al-hajj dib said .
" i was unable to contradict him , but my heart told me it was not quite right what we were doing , " the accused said .
" i believed in jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- and was against the us presence in iraq , but also opposed the use of violence against civilians . "
at the lebanese court hearing , hammad said the opposite .
he claimed that al-hajj dib thought up the plan and persuaded him to go along with it .
the two men built bombs using designs they found on the internet .
they placed the bombs in suitcases and went together to the train station in cologne on july 31 , 2006 .
the trains headed in opposite directions with the bombs on board .
german police said the men assembled the bombs incorrectly , which is why they failed to go off .
if they had exploded , it 's estimated that hundreds of people would 've been killed .
al-hajj dib was identified with the help of surveillance footage from the cologne airport .

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.02.2008 terrorist threat : to panic or not to panic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorism is a way of manipulating people 's fears with fresh reports suggesting germany is a terrorist target , dw-world.de asked trauma expert markos maragkos whether the authorities are merely sowing the seeds of panic when they alert the public to potential attacks . according to newspaper reports on friday , feb 8 , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks in germany .
" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .

like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .
only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the new text before the electorate in a referendum . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .

yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .

both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.02.2008 ignoring the public , french parliament approves eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public wanted a referendum , but did n't get one this time the french parliament friday approved the european union 's new reform treaty , nearly three years after rebellious french voters torpedoed the eu 's constitution .
this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .
only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the new text before the electorate in a referendum . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .

the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan gates presses europeans to back afghan mission germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens afghanistan -pipe- 08.02.2008 opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nato members are calling for more troops in southern afghanistan , while the germans want to stay comfortably in the north .
but no one wants to see the country fail , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was the usual game : before nearly every important nato meeting , the us and the other countries involved militarily in southern and eastern afghanistan put pressure on the rest of the nato members to send more troops . the german government then refuses once again to send bundeswehr soldiers to the more hostile south and tensions rise before the meeting . during the talks , however , things are usually not half as bad as expected .
and that 's how it turned out this time , too . us downplays demand for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the defense ministers ' meeting in vilnius , everyone agreed that nato as a whole has to do more in afghanistan .
us secretary of defense robert gates said that the evil media had exaggerated everything and he had just sent a cordial letter to all his fellow ministers - not only to the german defense minister . the pentagon chief suddenly showed understanding for the difficulties of coalition governments , like the one in berlin made up of conservatives and social democrats . even though tensions may have eased , the problem remains . nato still does n't have the additional troops for afghanistan that the military leaders wanted .
the tedious search for willing contributors will continue . who is willing to go ? german defense minister franz-josef jung got surprised reactions when he said that france , poland and romania would fill the gap with several thousand soldiers .
no one had heard about that except for him - an embarrassing misunderstanding . once again , vilnius demonstrated the attitude that the danish defense minister had put into words : if we wanted to , we could . the nato states have the means , but are lacking the political will . germany must discuss whether it 's ready to send more soldiers into the hot-spots in hindu kush .
the government wo n't be able to explain to its allies much longer why the germans are so poshly reserved when it comes to dangerous combat . other countries like italy and spain do the same thing , but they are also criticized for it .
the dutch and canadians are justified in asking , why us and not you , too ? no immediate crisis for nato nevertheless , nato is not about to split or even collapse .
despite all the disagreements over division of labor , one thing is clear : the afghanistan mission can not fail . the international community ca n't afford another failed state in this sensitive region .
that 's just what the taliban , al qaeda , and co. are waiting for . bernd riegert is a dw-radio correspondent in brussels . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bhutto 's pakistan people 's party has rejected the findings . the keenly-awaited 70-page report by british detectives shows that benazir bhutto died from a head injury caused by the force of the bomb blast in rawalpindi on dec .
27 , 2007 .
“ the scotland yard report establishes three things , ” the caretaker interior minister hamid nawaz said .
“ the first thing is that the only injury on the right side of her head was not caused by a bullet .
secondly , the one who fired and the suicide bomber were the same person .
thirdly , with the force of the bomb she collided with the vehicle .
these are the three things the report establishes . ”
but bhutto ’ s pakistan people ’ s party , or ppp , immediately rejected the conclusion drawn by the british detectives , insisting she was killed by the assassin ’ s bullet .
rejecting the report ppp leader , sherry rehman , who was with bhutto at the time of attack and survived the blast , is angry : “ we disagree with this finding but we have co-operated with them -lsb- the detectives -rsb- and we would look at the report in depth .
more importantly we will continue to ask for an international probe at the united nations level .
the report supports the version of president musharraf ’ s government that effectively holds bhutto responsible for her death by saying she was negligent about her security .
bhutto was standing in an open-roofed vehicle when she was killed .
scotland yard ’ s report has also stirred up a debate about the whole role of the british detectives in pakistan .
the detectives didn ’ t examine the body of benazir bhutto and vital evidence was not available because the crime scene was cleaned up with hoses within hours .
not much faith left “ the political parties , civil society , the lawyers and intelligentsia don ’ t have much faith left in the government , ” explained riaz khokar , an independent political analyst .
“ i am not so sure that the scotland yard report will smoothen anything . ”
“ there is also a feeling that united states and britain want to bail out this government .
there is a lot of negative feeling about the overall approach of the government to this particular case . ”
pakistan has a long history of political leaders dying in dubious circumstances - from the country ’ s first prime minister liaqat ali khan to dictator general zia ul haq and now benazir bhutto .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.02.2008 czech presidential race pits past against future , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the guards at prague 's presidential palace salute klaus or svejnar after friday ?
dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.02.2008 ignoring the public , french parliament approves eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public wanted a referendum , but did n't get one this time the french parliament friday approved the european union 's new reform treaty , nearly three years after rebellious french voters torpedoed the eu 's constitution .
this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .
only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the new text before the electorate in a referendum . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.02.2008 czech presidential race pits past against future , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the guards at prague 's presidential palace salute klaus or svejnar after friday ?
dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.02.2008 ignoring the public , french parliament approves eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public wanted a referendum , but did n't get one this time the french parliament friday approved the european union 's new reform treaty , nearly three years after rebellious french voters torpedoed the eu 's constitution .
this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .

an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?

" we have information suggesting that it is highly likely that terrorist plans exist , " bernhard falk from the bka told german daily die welt .
" we are concerned that in future , we will not be able to prevent these operations , " added august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency .
dw-world.de talked to markos maragkos , a clinical psychologist at the ludwig maximilians university in munich , about the effect of such news on the public mood .
dw-world.de : according to newspaper reports on friday , the bka maintains that al qaeda is planning specific attacks on germany . how does the public generally react to this kind of information ?
markos maragkos : how worried people get depends on their personal psychological make-up and past experience .
some people are predisposed to react to a dangerous situation with fear and anxiety .
other personalities with different past experiences are more cognitive - they are more prone to think : how likely it is that i or any one i know will be involved in a terrorist attack ?
if they decide this likelihood is relatively low , then they react more matter-of-factly .
people who are more cognitive are better able to influence their feelings ; they can rationalize a frightening situation and thereby control their fear .
that would be a more " normal " reaction - not that emotional people are not " normal . "
it 's simply a question of different dispositions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with every new attack , public fear levels creep up another notch would it be a " normal " reaction to decide not to take the subway anymore ?
any kind of extreme response is difficult .
problematic psychological behavior basically boils down to either an exaggerated response or denial .
a blanket refusal to take public transport could be what experts call maladaptive behavior .
on the other hand , were a specific warning issued about a threat in a particular place and someone went there anyway , their behavior would be equally maladaptive .
there are parameters of normal behavior , within which people weigh up the information they 're given and calculate the immediacy of the threat to their personal safety .
ultimately , the important thing is to remain in control of a situation - because terrorism hinges on its ability to destroy people 's trust in the predictability of their environment .
while terrorism first and foremost claims lives , its effect is also based on a manipulation of people 's fears .
they do n't know when or where the next attack will come , and they do n't know how to protect themselves against it .
they are rendered powerless , in a situation which they can not control .
this is hard to accept , because people are used to being in control of their lives .
what terrorism does is demonstrate that they actually have no control over what happens - their lives are in someone else 's hands .
is abstract anxiety harder to live with than a specific threat ?
definitely .
abstract anxiety is invariably a greater strain than a concrete fear .
if i know that a specific place has been targeted , then i avoid this place , and in doing so , i remain in control of the situation .
but if i do n't know what to expect every time i leave my home , then i end up in a state of abstract anxiety .
i start to suspect everyone , and see everything as a potential threat .
i am unable to relax and my stress levels shoot up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maragkos maintains it 's harder to cope with an abstract threat than a concrete one we 're normally told to confront our fears , which obviously is not an option in this case !
we only need to confront fears that are pathological - disproportionate fears that interfere with everyday life , such as a phobia about rats .
but what we 're talking about now are not pathological but normal fears .
it 's like being naturally afraid of high speeds - humans are scared of high speeds because they 're constitutionally unable to cope with them .
it 's not a fear that can be confronted , because it 's a healthy fear protecting us from potentially dangerous situations .
there are some exceptions .
take special forces in the army or the police .
they are trained to cope with their fears - which by no means they learn to lack feeling .
they learn to deal with heightened stress levels and extreme situations so they can become more used to them .
the point is not to eliminate fear , which would be fatal - or symptomatic of an anti-social personality disorder .
but given the ongoing terrorist threat , should n't we all now learn to deal with dangerous situations and heightened stress ?
we do need to learn to cope with our fears , just as every era and society learns to deal with certain threats .
right now we 're faced with the terrorist threat .
but from a psychological point of view , what we want to avoid is either an exaggerated response that borders on panic or a denial of the facts , along the lines of : it 's all humbug .
we need to remain watchful and we need to remain within a sensible range of emotional response .
have you seen a rise in the number of people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks since september 11 ?
this is a hotly debated issue among experts .
some psychologists maintain that prevalence rates have not risen .
others say they have .
if someone is inclined to fear , be it because of their character or their experience , then these days this person certainly has more opportunity to be fearful .
today , someone vulnerable has plenty of reason to feel anxious .
thirty or forty years ago , we finished school and started working , got married , and our lives were mapped out for us .
all that has changed .
life has become accelerated and everything is impermanent .
there is an absence of security .
so for someone inclined to fear , the modern world contains much to be afraid of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already had several brushes with terrorism do you think it 's irresponsible of the authorities to tell the public that terrorist attacks are planned and can not necessarily be prevented ?
no .
i often work with the authorities and i know that they take their responsibilities to the public very seriously .
but they 're in a difficult situation .
on the one hand they need to protect national security , but on the other hand they do n't want to unleash unnecessary panic .
imagine you were in a theatre and the director appeared and said : listen everyone , do n't worry , but we have an emergency .
half the audience would panic , the other half would try to figure out what to do .
but what should the director do ?
lie , and say it 's all under control - or exaggerate and say everyone 's lives are in danger ? interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .

he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .

the plan has met with skepticism in germany . during a meeting with merkel and school students from berlin on friday , feb .
8 , to discuss problems of young migrants such as language barriers , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan said he was in favor of integration and against assimiliation .
the turkish leader said he supported integration efforts but people 's differences must be accepted .
" in germany , it should be possible for high schools to be set up where the teaching is in turkish , " erdogan said , adding he also favored the idea of turkish-language universities in germany .
germany is home to western europe 's biggest population of turks - about 2.5 million people .
he added that children would not be able to master german unless they could speak their own language and added that turkey would be willing to send over teachers .
" if you want a turkish school , go to turkey " merkel reacted cautiously to the idea , saying she foresaw difficulties if turkish teachers were to work in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good grasp of the native tongue helps learn new languages , say experts education ministers from germany 's 16 federal states have agreed to promote the teaching of foreign languages in schools and linguists have often said in the past that a good grasp of the native tongue is an important prerequisite for learning new languages .
yet erdogan 's proposal remains politically controversial .
politicians warned against exporting turkish educational institutions to germany .
some have pointed out that six turkish-german schools already exist in germany .
" turkish schools and universities in germany would be a pure obstacle to integration , " said christine haderthauer , general secretary of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
both parties oppose turkey 's entry into the european union " if you want a turkish school , go to turkey , " said haderthauer .
no to teachers from turkey other politicians said they were in favour of teaching turkish in schools in germany , but that it had to be done by locally trained teachers who were familiar with the problems of migrants .
" speaking two languages is not damaging , i support erdogan in that respect , " cem özdemir of germany 's opposition green party told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . but he added that schools or teachers from turkey could n't be simply relocated to germany .
kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community too was criticial of erdogan 's proposal , saying that though the native tongue , turkish , was important , german was no less so .
" integration can only work this way -lrb- if both languages are on an equal footing -rrb- , " kolat told spiegel .
he rejected the idea of importing teachers from turkey .
" they do n't know the society here , they have n't studied here . "
integration is a delicate topic in germany as in many other parts of western europe with large immigrant populations .
children from immigrant backgrounds perform markedly worse at school than their german counterparts .
merkel has talked about helping young immigrants get better education to avoid alienation and help them find jobs .
blaze stokes tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women with headscarves gaze at the building where the fire broke out tensions between germans and turks were fuelled last week by a fire in a housing block in the german city of ludwigshafen , killing nine people of turkish origin .
the cause of the fire remains unknown but turkish media have speculated that it was a racially motivated attack .
the blaze has stirred memories of a firebombing by germans in 1993 in the town of solingen which killed five turks .
erdogan visited the site this week and met with survivors .
he has called on police to clear up the case swiftly . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.02.2008 chad president calls on eu to send peacekeeping force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what role have french troops played in the conflict ?
an eu peacekeeping force on chad 's border with sudan 's darfur region had been due to arrive in february .
but after fighting in chad 's capital killed hundreds and caused thousands to flee , the mission is now on hold . as his government stepped up security after the weekend rebel assault on the capital , chad 's president idriss deby called on the eu thursday , feb .
7 , to deploy the peacekeeping force to the eastern part of the country urgently .
" we want to launch a solemn appeal to the european union , and france ... to make sure that this force is put in place as quickly as possible to lighten the load we are carrying , " said deby in an interview broadcast on france 's europe 1 radio .
the recent clashes between government troops and rebels have delayed the deployment of the 3,700-strong force to protect the half a million sudanese refugees and displaced chadians who have fled violence - plunging the fates of the refugees on both sides of the border into even greater uncertainty .
relief officials said the unrest in chad threatened to provoke a humanitarian crisis by blocking aid flights .
the european union had started deployment of its first forces last week , but suspended it almost immediately due to the rebel attack .
a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the deployment would start again once the situation was clearer , reported reuters .
" it 's a question of security , as soon as the operation commander and the force commander decide the situation is clear , the deployment will resume , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
although fighting has ebbed with the withdrawal from n 'djamena of the insurgents , normality has not yet returned .
aid agencies estimate that some 60,000 chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on the cpaital , n 'djamena .
a few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of chadian police on wednesday , but others are waiting for the situation to improve .
conflicting reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian rebel forces entered ndjamena last weekend meanwhile , the web site of the french daily la croix reported late thursday that french special forces soldiers took part in the battle to drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
if the report is true , then france , which has over 1,000 troops stationed in the central african oil producer , intervened in the fighting without approval from the un security council .
a spokesman for the rebels , ali ordjo hemchi , said they had taken the town of mongo , 600 km east of n 'djamena , and were bombed by french warplanes and helicopters .
french president nicolas sarkozy and idriss deby deny all claims that the french army has fought on the side of government troops .
on thursday , deby said that paris had only provided important intelligence that helped government troops drive the rebels out of n 'djamena .
the two countries have a military cooperation pact that obliges the french government to furnish intelligence and logistical help , but does not allow french troops to engage in combat .
media speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of zoe 's ark are accused of kidnapping and child trafficking french media speculated thursday that deby 's offer to pardon six french aid workers convicted in december in a chadian court of kidnapping 103 children might have been repayment for french help in the conflict .
" there is obviously no connection between the two affairs , " insisted a spokesman for french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the rebels , who fought their way into n 'djamena on saturday with a column of 300 pick-ups mounted with cannon and machine guns , have long accused paris of propping up deby 's 18-year-old government , which they call corrupt and dictatorial .
in what has been perceived as a gesture of gratitude , deby said he could pardon six members of french charity zoe 's ark sentenced to eight years in prison by chad for abducting children , if france requested it .
a spokesman for sarkozy said on thursday france would pass on any request for a pardon from members of zoe 's ark , who are serving their jail terms in france . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.02.2008 czech presidential race pits past against future , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the guards at prague 's presidential palace salute klaus or svejnar after friday ?
dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.02.2008 czech presidential race pits past against future , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the guards at prague 's presidential palace salute klaus or svejnar after friday ?
dw-world.de spoke to political analyst jiri pehe about the czech presidential vote on friday , feb .
8 , which pits euroskeptic president vaclav klaus against brussels-friendly émigré jan svejnar in a neck-to-neck race . currently director of new york university in prague , jiri pehe ran the political department of then president vaclav havel from 1997 to 1999 .
he is one of the czech republic 's leading political analysts .
dw-world.de : just a month ago , it looked as though vaclav klaus would have no problem winning a second term .
but since then we 've seen jan svejnar arrive on the scene and the race suddenly looks a lot harder to predict .
what result are you expecting ?
jiri pehe : it will be a very tight race .
in my opinion it may go into a third round .
the presidential election in the czech republic is structured in such a way that if no one is elected in the first two rounds when the two houses of parliament vote secretly , then in the third round , the two houses create one electoral body of 281 electors and whoever gets the majority wins .
since the communist party has said it will try to block the election of either of the two candidates , it is quite possible that the first election will not be successful .
so the communist party might prove to be the kingmaker ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has vaclav klaus kept his promises ?
once again , the communist party does seem to be in the role of kingmaker .
in 2003 , it helped vaclav klaus get elected .
this time it has a different strategy .
vojtech filip , chairman of the communist party , has repeatedly said that the communist party would prefer to block the first election altogether and then sit down with the social democrats and come up with a candidate who would be more leftist .
very broadly , what have been the main issues at stake in this presidential race ?
i think the issues are very bound up with the person of jan svejnar , who says : i represent the future , i have a forward-looking approach .
vaclav klaus has been in czech politics for 19 years and now represents the past .
klaus is a very experienced politician who certainly knows the business , but he does n't bring anything new to the table , and in fact if he does , it 's usually simply opposition towards something .
even if svejnar does n't win , has he nonetheless changed czech political culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svejnar has changed the face of czech politics he has contributed a great deal to the atmosphere of czech political culture .
his approach has been novel .
he decided to run what is referred to here in the czech republic as an ' american ' campaign .
so even though the president is elected by parliament , he traveled around the country , he spoke to people and presented his views .
and in a country where the president is elected through behind-the-scenes deals , this was a very refreshing approach .
he basically said to the current political establishment : look , let 's do it openly , let 's find the best person and not just let someone in who promises the most , behind-the-scenes .
and how has the czech public responded to svejnar 's more american style ?
the czech public and the media were quite skeptical at the beginning but svejnar really managed to excite the people .
the latest opinion polls show that he is gaining on mr. klaus or even leading , which means that more people would prefer to see him as president than mr. klaus .
given that his campaign has lasted only about two months , this is an amazing achievement . he deserves full credit for being a very good candidate .
how big a problem has svejnar 's us citizenship been ?
mr. svejnar 's us citizenship has been an issue , especially for the communist party .
and since he needs its support to get elected , he ended up promising that if he gets elected he will give it up .
personally , i do n't feel this was a very smart idea on his part - because it was really only the communist party demanding it .
but if he feels that this is necessary to impress the czech republic and the communist party , then i respect his decision .
will svejnar still have a future in czech politics even if he loses ?
definitely .
he has created huge public expectations .
a lot of people are pinning their hopes on him .
even if he loses the presidential election , he will be under great pressure to stay in czech politics in some role .
there is some speculation about him becoming a member of the current government or founding a new political party .
certainly , if he does so , he will have good chances of succeeding because he represents a political center which at the moment is not well represented in czech politics .
the czech republic is due to take over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2009 , so this will be a very crucial term for a czech president .
given how much of an eu-skeptic klaus is known to be , will the eu issue prove to be decisive on friday ?
the eu is certainly an important issue , and personally i do n't think it 's mentioned as much as it should be .
indeed , if klaus is re-elected , he will have a free hand because he will not have to care about another term and will basically be able to do whatever he wants to do .
he may well become even stronger than he is now in his anti-european views .
the czech president does n't have many powers , but one of the powers he does have is to veto laws .
as president , he could veto the new european reform treaty , which would then have to go back to the parliament for a new round of discussions .
certainly , mr klaus has made it clear that if he is re-elected , the czech republic will not adopt the common european currency until after the end of his second presidential term in 2013 .
so there are certainly some very concrete threats coming from mr klaus with regard to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav havel : a hard act to follow klaus is also well-known for his skeptical stance on global warming , which he calls bogus , and environmentalism " a threat to freedom and economic growth . "
is this position counting against him , or does he have support for it within the czech republic ?
klaus has been very careful in his choice of topics .
the only topic on which he is outspoken and which has any political relevance is the european union , but other issues - such as global warming , the ideology of human rights or his opposition to civil society - are not really politically very sensitive issues in the czech republic .
a lot of politicians - with the exception of the green party , which clearly cares about the environment - take his views on global warming as somewhat extreme and out of line , but since these views have no direct impact on czech politics , they will not play any role in the presidential election .
given that the presidency is a largely symbolic post , how important for the czech republic is the outcome of this week 's election ?
the outcome is important on two levels .
firstly , on a symbolic level .
the president is very highly regarded by the czech people : the presidency is a very important post from the public 's point of view .
the president 's approach sets the agenda .
secondly , although the president does n't have too many powers , he does have some .
he can appoint judges , for example , and members of the governing body of the central bank .
he can leave a legacy in the form of these appointments , which will stay with us for many years to come .
so , in this respect , it will be very important who the next president is .
and i suspect that if mr. klaus is re-elected , he will make sure that the governing board of the central bank is fully staffed with people who are opposed to the introduction of the common european currency .
when vaclav havel left office in 2003 , he was seen as a very hard act to follow .
how has klaus done ?
mr. klaus has definitely tried to be a down-to-earth president .
he was n't brought to office by history , as havel was , but by an electoral process - and he tried to make his presidency more ordinary than havel 's was .
but on the other hand , he failed to live up to his promises of being a non-partisan president .
before his election in 2003 , he promised to be above political parties and to respect the constitution .
unfortunately , he has repeatedly tried to test the constitution and constitutional powers during his presidency , and as honorary chairman of the conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , he is most definitely politically partisan . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.02.2008 ignoring the public , french parliament approves eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public wanted a referendum , but did n't get one this time the french parliament friday approved the european union 's new reform treaty , nearly three years after rebellious french voters torpedoed the eu 's constitution .
this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .
ireland the exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland will be letting the people decide hungary was first to ratify the treaty in december , followed by slovenia and malta late last month and romania which ratified the charter this week .
slovakia 's parliament was seeking on thursday to agree on the text , while many other countries have yet to set a date for its adoption .
germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .
british prime minister gordon brown has been forced to fight off demands for a plebiscite , which most commentators believe would scupper the treaty 's adoption .
only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the new text before the electorate in a referendum . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , the public did n't have a say . both the national assembly and senate voted resoundingly in favor of what is now known as the treaty of lisbon , a tailored-down version of the ill-fated constitution that was consigned to oblivion in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
it is now to be formally ratified by president nicolas sarkozy , who played a leading role in drawing up the new text .
france will be the fifth eu country - and the first major eu power - to ratify the new treaty , which must be approved in all 27 member states before it can take effect as planned in 2009 .
france 's europe minister jean-pierre jouyet described it as a " historic moment " opening a fresh chapter in france 's relations with the eu as it prepares to take over the six-month presidency of the bloc in july .
" this is excellent news , a great victory for france which has gone from being the country holding up europe to being the one that pulled europe out of gridlock , " said sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon .
second referendum too risky bildunterschrift : voting in versailles crucially , the public has had no say in the decision - even though recent opinion polls show that 58 percent want a plebiscite on the new treaty .
but rather than risk a second referendum , sarkozy insisted the new treaty be ratified by parliament .
his refusal to submit it to popular scrutiny has fuelled anger across opposition ranks .
the main opposition socialists split over the 2005 eu referendum when a rebel faction defied party leaders to campaign for a " no " vote , and the new treaty re-opened many of the old wounds .
a breakaway group of socialist deputies joined the far-left and a handful of right-wing sovereignists in voting against the treaty on thursday , while a small number boycotted the vote entirely .
but most of the socialists joined the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and its centrist allies in back the bill authorizing sarkozy to ratify the treaty , which was adopted in the national assembly by 336 votes to 52 against .
the senate voted early friday by 265 to 42 to approve the lisbon treaty , with most socialists lawmakers again joining their ruling party counterparts .
new and improved ?
the french parliament held a special congress of both houses monday to amend the constitution , deleting an obsolete reference to the doomed draft eu constitution , to allow the new text to enter french law .
like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc .

germany plans to ratify the treaty by june while others such as sweden , spain and the netherlands are expected to follow suit later in the year .

phillip walters said press speculation about " suicide pacts " was incorrect .
madeleine moon , the local mp , said the spate of deaths in the area masked a suicide rate across wales that was 35 % higher than in england .
she pointed out that scotland had invested £ 20m in a suicide strategy while bridgend was waiting for funding .
ms moon said lottery funding may not be available until next year .
she called for a suicide prevention strategy for wales , and said it was " shocking " one had not been set up .

" we do n't want to live in a super-tip .
" the sites should not be located within a kilometre of any residential community .
" apart from the cumulative health effects of having so many landfill sites in such a small district , there is extra danger and pollution from all the lorries generated by these extra sites . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- on the trail of manhunt 2 bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 8 february 2008 , 09:00 gmt on the trail of manhunt 2 by darren waters technology editor , bbc news website manhunt 2 is the most controversial video game in history .
banned last june by the british board of film classification , it is at the centre of a legal row that is defining what is and what is not acceptable in video games .
but what makes this game so objectionable ?
in the us adult gamers have been able to buy and play manhunt 2 since last year .
but in the uk the game is not available for sale and developers rockstar are not even legally able to share the game with journalists .
copies of the game can be bought on ebay from us sellers .
but in order to play it i had to visit the developer 's london offices in person and be shown the us copy of the title .
the bbfc says its position is clear .
when it was first banned in june last year , david cooke , director of the bbfc , said : " manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone .
" there is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed , and encouraged , in the game . "
developer rockstar is no stranger to controversy - it faced criticism over last year 's title bully , mainly from a press which mis-understood the game and assumed the player took on the role of a bully .
in actual fact , the player 's role was to challenge the bullies .
but its highly successful grand theft auto series has come in for regular criticism that the titles glorify crime , especially violence . "
there are concerns about the whole tone of the game and what it may or may not do to people who play the game " bbfc spokeswoman rockstar says its position is equally transparent : it says it makes games that are " well within the bounds established by other 18 + games " .
before playing the game i sat through two of the most violent films of recent years - saw and its sequel .
both films have 18 certificates and are blood-laden , gore-fests which feature torture , mutilation and strong violence throughout .
manhunt 2 is a similarly violent and blood-infused experience .
the player takes on the role of danny , who makes his escape from a mental institution leaving behind a trail of murdered guards and inmates .
the method of his killing is particularly gruesome - the player can stab , kick , beat , axe and even suffocate characters in the game .
there is also the option to make the deaths more spectacular - the longer a certain button is held , the more violent the ensuing death .
death and murder is one of the principal elements of the game , along with basic puzzles .
after about two hours playing manhunt 2 , it is impossible to argue with the bbfc 's assessment that the game is unremittingly bleak and callous .
but the violence is stylised - and not particularly real .
the deaths play out as mini-scenes reminiscent of action in the current crop of horror movies that are doing so well at the box office , such as hostel , cabin fever and the two titles i had watched .
and the amount of killing in the game is no greater than in any number of titles that have been released in the last 12 months - from call of duty 4 to bioshock .
the game is currently in limbo .
after the bbfc was told to issue the title with a certificate by its own video appeals committee , the organisation sought and won a judicial review which forces the vac to look again at the game .
the bbfc successful argued that the vac had been guilty of " a very serious misdirection of law " on the question of harm .
the bbfc has been the uk 's " censor " for more than 90 years but in the last 20 years it has asked for fewer and fewer cuts in films , reflecting both a modernised certification system and a more liberal attitude .
last year it asked for cuts in just five films , compared with almost 60 in 1989 .
no figures are available for games but manhunt 2 is certainly the most contested title in uk history .
as games become ever more photo-real and as developers start tackling ever more adult themes the bbfc could find itself at the centre of more disputes if it continues to be the body which classifies games in the uk .
there is a growing body of opinion calling for pan-european game classifications to replace national systems .
there is currently a voluntary system , called pegi , which sits alongside bbfc ratings in the uk .
dr tanya byron , who is conducting a review of video games and their impact on children , is believed to favour pegi replacing the bbfc .
one game developer told bbc news that he believed the manhunt 2 controversy was " the bbfc trying to prove it has teeth in an attempt to avoid being pushed out of the way in favour of pegi " .
rockstar says it is committed to seeing manhunt 2 released in the uk and one staff member said he was " quietly confident " the vac would rule in its favour .
critics of the classification system point out that the vac is a panel chosen by the bbfc and it is unclear when the committee will meet to decide the game 's fate .
a spokeswoman for the bbfc said no date was in the diary .
she said : " classification is not a science ; it 's a judgement based on guidelines .
" it went too far .
there are concerns about the whole tone of the game and what it may or may not do to people who play the game .
" our judgement is a line we have drawn at this game , " said the spokeswoman .
" if the vac do not find in our favour , then that line has to move , " she added .
gamers and the game industry are waiting to see what happens to that line .

banned last june by the british board of film classification , it is at the centre of a legal row that is defining what is and what is not acceptable in video games .
but what makes this game so objectionable ?
in the us adult gamers have been able to buy and play manhunt 2 since last year .
but in the uk the game is not available for sale and developers rockstar are not even legally able to share the game with journalists .
copies of the game can be bought on ebay from us sellers .
but in order to play it i had to visit the developer 's london offices in person and be shown the us copy of the title .
the bbfc says its position is clear .
when it was first banned in june last year , david cooke , director of the bbfc , said : " manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone .
" there is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed , and encouraged , in the game . "
developer rockstar is no stranger to controversy - it faced criticism over last year 's title bully , mainly from a press which mis-understood the game and assumed the player took on the role of a bully .
in actual fact , the player 's role was to challenge the bullies .
but its highly successful grand theft auto series has come in for regular criticism that the titles glorify crime , especially violence .
there are concerns about the whole tone of the game and what it may or may not do to people who play the game bbfc spokeswoman rockstar says its position is equally transparent : it says it makes games that are " well within the bounds established by other 18 + games " .
before playing the game i sat through two of the most violent films of recent years - saw and its sequel .
both films have 18 certificates and are blood-laden , gore-fests which feature torture , mutilation and strong violence throughout .
manhunt 2 boasts a range of murder methods manhunt 2 is a similarly violent and blood-infused experience .

there are concerns about the whole tone of the game and what it may or may not do to people who play the game bbfc spokeswoman rockstar says its position is equally transparent : it says it makes games that are " well within the bounds established by other 18 + games " .
before playing the game i sat through two of the most violent films of recent years - saw and its sequel .
both films have 18 certificates and are blood-laden , gore-fests which feature torture , mutilation and strong violence throughout .
manhunt 2 boasts a range of murder methods manhunt 2 is a similarly violent and blood-infused experience .
the player takes on the role of danny , who makes his escape from a mental institution leaving behind a trail of murdered guards and inmates .
the method of his killing is particularly gruesome - the player can stab , kick , beat , axe and even suffocate characters in the game .
there is also the option to make the deaths more spectacular - the longer a certain button is held , the more violent the ensuing death .
death and murder is one of the principal elements of the game , along with basic puzzles .
after about two hours playing manhunt 2 , it is impossible to argue with the bbfc 's assessment that the game is unremittingly bleak and callous .
the game is on sale in the us but the violence is stylised - and not particularly real .
the deaths play out as mini-scenes reminiscent of action in the current crop of horror movies that are doing so well at the box office , such as hostel , cabin fever and the two titles i had watched .
and the amount of killing in the game is no greater than in any number of titles that have been released in the last 12 months - from call of duty 4 to bioshock .
the game is currently in limbo .
after the bbfc was told to issue the title with a certificate by its own video appeals committee , the organisation sought and won a judicial review which forces the vac to look again at the game .
the bbfc successful argued that the vac had been guilty of " a very serious misdirection of law " on the question of harm .
the bbfc has been the uk 's " censor " for more than 90 years but in the last 20 years it has asked for fewer and fewer cuts in films , reflecting both a modernised certification system and a more liberal attitude .
last year it asked for cuts in just five films , compared with almost 60 in 1989 .
no figures are available for games but manhunt 2 is certainly the most contested title in uk history .
as games become ever more photo-real and as developers start tackling ever more adult themes the bbfc could find itself at the centre of more disputes if it continues to be the body which classifies games in the uk .
the player controls danny , who escapes from an asylum there is a growing body of opinion calling for pan-european game classifications to replace national systems .
there is currently a voluntary system , called pegi , which sits alongside bbfc ratings in the uk .
dr tanya byron , who is conducting a review of video games and their impact on children , is believed to favour pegi replacing the bbfc .
one game developer told bbc news that he believed the manhunt 2 controversy was " the bbfc trying to prove it has teeth in an attempt to avoid being pushed out of the way in favour of pegi " .
rockstar says it is committed to seeing manhunt 2 released in the uk and one staff member said he was " quietly confident " the vac would rule in its favour .
critics of the classification system point out that the vac is a panel chosen by the bbfc and it is unclear when the committee will meet to decide the game 's fate .
a spokeswoman for the bbfc said no date was in the diary .
she said : " classification is not a science ; it 's a judgement based on guidelines .
" it went too far .
there are concerns about the whole tone of the game and what it may or may not do to people who play the game .
" our judgement is a line we have drawn at this game , " said the spokeswoman .
" if the vac do not find in our favour , then that line has to move , " she added .
gamers and the game industry are waiting to see what happens to that line .

last year it asked for cuts in just five films , compared with almost 60 in 1989 .
no figures are available for games but manhunt 2 is certainly the most contested title in uk history .

there is currently a voluntary system , called pegi , which sits alongside bbfc ratings in the uk .
dr tanya byron , who is conducting a review of video games and their impact on children , is believed to favour pegi replacing the bbfc .
one game developer told bbc news that he believed the manhunt 2 controversy was " the bbfc trying to prove it has teeth in an attempt to avoid being pushed out of the way in favour of pegi " .
rockstar says it is committed to seeing manhunt 2 released in the uk and one staff member said he was " quietly confident " the vac would rule in its favour .
critics of the classification system point out that the vac is a panel chosen by the bbfc and it is unclear when the committee will meet to decide the game 's fate .
a spokeswoman for the bbfc said no date was in the diary .
she said : " classification is not a science ; it 's a judgement based on guidelines .

there are concerns about the whole tone of the game and what it may or may not do to people who play the game .

banned last june by the british board of film classification , it is at the centre of a legal row that is defining what is and what is not acceptable in video games .
but what makes this game so objectionable ?
in the us adult gamers have been able to buy and play manhunt 2 since last year .
but in the uk the game is not available for sale and developers rockstar are not even legally able to share the game with journalists .
copies of the game can be bought on ebay from us sellers .
but in order to play it i had to visit the developer 's london offices in person and be shown the us copy of the title .
the bbfc says its position is clear .
when it was first banned in june last year , david cooke , director of the bbfc , said : " manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone .
" there is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed , and encouraged , in the game . "
developer rockstar is no stranger to controversy - it faced criticism over last year 's title bully , mainly from a press which mis-understood the game and assumed the player took on the role of a bully .
in actual fact , the player 's role was to challenge the bullies .
but its highly successful grand theft auto series has come in for regular criticism that the titles glorify crime , especially violence .
there are concerns about the whole tone of the game and what it may or may not do to people who play the game bbfc spokeswoman rockstar says its position is equally transparent : it says it makes games that are " well within the bounds established by other 18 + games " .
before playing the game i sat through two of the most violent films of recent years - saw and its sequel .
both films have 18 certificates and are blood-laden , gore-fests which feature torture , mutilation and strong violence throughout .
manhunt 2 boasts a range of murder methods manhunt 2 is a similarly violent and blood-infused experience .
the player takes on the role of danny , who makes his escape from a mental institution leaving behind a trail of murdered guards and inmates .
the method of his killing is particularly gruesome - the player can stab , kick , beat , axe and even suffocate characters in the game .
there is also the option to make the deaths more spectacular - the longer a certain button is held , the more violent the ensuing death .
death and murder is one of the principal elements of the game , along with basic puzzles .
after about two hours playing manhunt 2 , it is impossible to argue with the bbfc 's assessment that the game is unremittingly bleak and callous .
the game is on sale in the us but the violence is stylised - and not particularly real .
the deaths play out as mini-scenes reminiscent of action in the current crop of horror movies that are doing so well at the box office , such as hostel , cabin fever and the two titles i had watched .
and the amount of killing in the game is no greater than in any number of titles that have been released in the last 12 months - from call of duty 4 to bioshock .
the game is currently in limbo .
after the bbfc was told to issue the title with a certificate by its own video appeals committee , the organisation sought and won a judicial review which forces the vac to look again at the game .

reports vary but some estimates suggest there were five times as many variants of malicious programs in circulation in 2007 compared to 2006 .
security company panda software said it was getting more than 3,000 novel samples of so called malware every day .
criminals pump out variants to fool anti-virus programs that work , in part , by spotting common characteristics .
threat landscape security software testing organisation av test reported that it saw 5.49 million unique samples of malicious software in 2007 - five times more than the 972,606 it saw in 2006 .
av test reached its total by analysing malicious programs and generating a digital fingerprint for each unique sample .
the organisation said the different ways malware can be packaged will mean some duplication in its figures , but the broad trend showed a steep rise .
the organisation uses the samples to test security programs to see how many they can spot and stop .
panda software said the number of malicious samples it received in 2007 was up ten fold on 2006 .
in a statement it said the rise represented a " malware epidemic " .
finnish security firm f-secure said it had seen a doubling in the number of pieces of malware it detected in 2007 compared to 2006 .
most of the malicious programs detected by these security organisations are aimed at the various versions of microsoft 's windows operating system .
the vast majority of these unique malicious programs will be made up of elements from older viruses that have been scrambled to look fresh .
" it started about nine months ago , in early 2007 , we saw massive surges of new variants , " said gerhard eschelbeck , chief technology officer at anti-spyware firm webroot .
" there are days when we see 1,000 or more new samples , " he said .
" it 's a low-effort high-frequency type threat , " he said .
" there 's no completely ground-breaking new stuff out there . "
he added that hi-tech criminals were adopting several tactics to avoid being spotted by anti-virus programs which try to spot the " signature " of each malicious program they know about .
" anti-virus relies on customers to submit samples , " said mr eschelbeck , " but with spyware you typically do not get samples because your customers do not know they are infected . "
increasingly , security firms have turned to new techniques to combat the rise in malware variants .
some use heuristics , or rules of thumb , to spot programs that are similar rather than identical to the ones they have seen before .
others are using behaviour blockers that shut down any program that shows malicious intent .

reports vary but some estimates suggest there were five times as many variants of malicious programs in circulation in 2007 compared to 2006 .
security company panda software said it was getting more than 3,000 novel samples of so called malware every day .
criminals pump out variants to fool anti-virus programs that work , in part , by spotting common characteristics .
threat landscape security software testing organisation av test reported that it saw 5.49 million unique samples of malicious software in 2007 - five times more than the 972,606 it saw in 2006 .
av test reached its total by analysing malicious programs and generating a digital fingerprint for each unique sample .
the organisation said the different ways malware can be packaged will mean some duplication in its figures , but the broad trend showed a steep rise .
the organisation uses the samples to test security programs to see how many they can spot and stop .
panda software said the number of malicious samples it received in 2007 was up ten fold on 2006 .
in a statement it said the rise represented a " malware epidemic " .
finnish security firm f-secure said it had seen a doubling in the number of pieces of malware it detected in 2007 compared to 2006 .
most of the malicious programs detected by these security organisations are aimed at the various versions of microsoft 's windows operating system .
the vast majority of these unique malicious programs will be made up of elements from older viruses that have been scrambled to look fresh .
" it started about nine months ago , in early 2007 , we saw massive surges of new variants , " said gerhard eschelbeck , chief technology officer at anti-spyware firm webroot .
" there are days when we see 1,000 or more new samples , " he said .
" it 's a low-effort high-frequency type threat , " he said .
" there 's no completely ground-breaking new stuff out there . "
he added that hi-tech criminals were adopting several tactics to avoid being spotted by anti-virus programs which try to spot the " signature " of each malicious program they know about .
" anti-virus relies on customers to submit samples , " said mr eschelbeck , " but with spyware you typically do not get samples because your customers do not know they are infected . "
increasingly , security firms have turned to new techniques to combat the rise in malware variants .
some use heuristics , or rules of thumb , to spot programs that are similar rather than identical to the ones they have seen before .
others are using behaviour blockers that shut down any program that shows malicious intent .

he was extradited to the capital , malabo , from zimbabwe last week without the knowledge of his lawyers .
the ex-sas officer was jailed in zimbabwe on arms charges in 2004 , and rearrested after his release last may .
equatorial guinea has a poor human rights record .
amnesty international says that a german national arrested in the country over the same alleged coup plot was tortured before he died in prison .
' proof ' mann , 55 , was seen in handcuffs , leg irons and a blue prison uniform in the notorious black beach prison in malabo .
he was surrounded by military personnel .
mr mann 's welfare remains our number one priority british foreign office spokeswoman government spokesman santiago efuman said that mann would be put on trial and that there was " proof showing simon mann was the hand guiding the actions of the mercenaries against equatorial guinea " .
a british foreign office spokeswoman said a consul based in nigeria had travelled to equatorial guinea and was trying to meet him .

one south african , nick du toit , remains in prison in equatorial guinea , serving a 34-year sentence .
