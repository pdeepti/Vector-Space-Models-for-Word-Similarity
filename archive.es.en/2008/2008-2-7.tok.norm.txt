" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .

" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .

he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .

" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .

while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with . " germany 's special role has definitely come to an end . " similarly , die welt wrote wednesday evening in its online edition that germany 's contribution to isaf is not a favor , but a duty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has insisted on more support from other nato partners " after ignoring for years the cries for help from the allies , it 's now high time that german politics came clean with the population about what 's necessary for a successful operation in hindu kush - that the bundeswehr 's main job is not civilian reconstruction but to militarily ensure security so that reconstruction is possible in the first place , " the paper opined . in light of a recent letter from us secretary of defense robert gates to jung with an explicit request for german troops in southern afghanistan , die welt said the us is not the only ally to exert pressure : " all the nato partners , like britain and the netherlands and especially from the canadians , who lost 60 men over a short time in hostilities with the taliban , " have pushed germany for more assistance . with its decision , " germany has crossed a magic line , " concluded the paper . " the growing criticism from the us , canada and britain over the german involvement in afghanistan is justified , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung commented thursday .
the paper added that " chancellor merkel does n't have much success to show , either militarily or in reconstruction . " the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .
" it is quickly sending combat troops because the norwegians are withdrawing their soldiers .
it 's filling holes that the czechs and danes left .
and more soldiers are being sent to kunduz because the situation there has worsened . " pressure to join the fighting in the south has only temporarily subsided .
but the majority wo n't accept that .
it can be expected instead that the government compromises in the north and increases its mandate where possible , " the paper concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .

" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "

trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.02.2008 turkish lawmakers vote to end headscarf ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will university students soon be allowed to wear headscarves in turkey ?
the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves . " on saturday , feb .
2 , more than 125,000 people , mostly women , had demonstrated against the end of the headscarf ban . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .
full stop , " she said .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .
" they need to make sure that toys are age appropriate , " ellis said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves . " on saturday , feb .

7 that it would not send a delegation to russia 's march 2 presidential election because of restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lennmarker made the osce decision final via official letter the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send the observers a full month in advance , a move opposed by russia .
" we regret that circumstances prevent us from observing this election , " osce spokesman spencer oliver told news agencies .
the president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly , goran lennmarker , wrote to the head of the russian state parliament , boris gryzlov , making the decision official .
" we unfortunately can not accept your invitation to send a limited number of observers to russia for the presidential election taking place on march 2 , " he said in the letter , released to the press .
russia deplores osce move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition groups say the presidential vote is rigged for medvedev , left russia , in return , criticized the decision .
" we believe the actions of the odihr are unacceptable , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in a statement .
" we can not but deeply regret this position , " he added .
the 320-member parliamentary assembly is made up of lawmakers from each of the osce 's 56 member states .
according to the watchdog 's website , its main aim is to improve dialogue between the parliaments of those member countries .
lennmarker 's letter followed a lengthy dispute between odihr and russian diplomats .
the odihr had stepped up pressure on moscow to allow its own observers into the country ahead of the election .
russia announced in late january that it was inviting 400 foreign monitors to observe the vote , but odihr has criticized " unprecedented restrictions " imposed on the observers .
repeat of earlier events earlier on thursday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia refused to comply with the conditions put forward by the odihr .
" this is called an ultimatum , " lavrov told reporters .
" self-respecting countries do not accept ultimatums . "
lavrov said that the osce had " impolitely " insisted on sending observers a month before the march 2 vote , and that this was unnecessary .
the odihr already boycotted russia 's december parliamentary election , saying proper observation was impossible under the conditions imposed by russia .
president vladimir putin , who is stepping down at the end of his second term , is expected to be replaced by his close ally dmitry medvedev in the presidential vote , which opposition groups say is being rigged . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .

" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .

in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "

bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

" in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .

the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .

" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with .

" the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .

germans and turks alike worry that the country is a social tinderbox , and the ludwigshafen fire the match that could set it alight . the event has revived memories of a firebomb attack by germans in 1993 on a house in solingen .
five turks were killed in that attack , which made international headlines .
about 2.5 million people of turkish decent call germany home , making them the largest minority in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and turkish officials visited the scene and called for calm during a visit to the site with mustafa sait yazicioglu , the turkish minister responsible for affairs involving turks living abroad , maria böhmer , the german commissioner for integration , urged caution ahead of the investigation . she called for restraint from the turkish press , which has been quick to speculate that neo-nazis were to blame for the blaze .
she also told reporters that a fireman who had helped put out the fire had been attacked by turkish youths the following tuesday . the fire broke out on sunday , feb .

it quickly engulfed the four-story building , which housed a turkish cultural center and the apartments of two turkish families , in smoke and flames . hate-graffiti and sniffer dogs people jumped for their lives from the burning building ; and in a dramatic scene , a 32-year-old man saved his infant nephew , onur , by throwing him to a policeman 23 feet below , who caught the child . nine people died in the fire , including five children and three mothers under 25 , one of whom was pregnant , a member of a local turkish community group said . two girls , aged 8 and 9 , have said they saw a man setting fire to something and throwing it into a baby stroller in the hallway of the building .
police were working with the witnesses to develop a sketch of the man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trained dogs have yet to find traces of arson it is hoped they will be able to recall enough to produce a portrait , police spokesman volker klein told the ap news service . " every clue is being taken seriously , " he said .
however , an initial search with sniffer dogs turned up no trace of substances that might have fed the fire . news agencies reported wednesday that neo-nazi graffiti was found scrawled on the entrance to a turkish cultural center that was in the building . the german word for hate , hass , was written twice on the wall , with the final two letters in the nazi " ss " rune script , police spokesman michael lindner said .
he said the graffiti must have been there before the fire because the building had been secured since the blaze on sunday . " if the factual cause of the fire is discovered and the necessary steps are taken , it will be easier for turkish people to be at peace , " yazicioglu said on a visit to the ruins of the block . turkish investigators , politicians on the scene authorities have already said that two small fires were started in the building in 2006 and added that they were quickly put out by residents .
it is not yet clear if they were related to the weekend 's fire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german fireman was attacked by turkish youths after the fire in an unusual move that reflects how much is at stake in the investigation , turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , traveling to germany for security conference , will visit the site of the fire on thursday .
turkey 's ambassador to germany and yazicioglu have also taken trips to ludwigshafen . moreover , turkish officials placed a team of four police officers from turkey be part of the team that investigates the fire , ostensibly to assure fairness in the investigation . " our people should not have any concerns about the investigation , " yazicioglu told turkish reporters after inspecting the site .
" the investigation will be concluded in a way that leaves no room for any doubt . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday urged people not to jump to any conclusions as to the cause . " it is terrible misfortune , it is really a catastrophe , but there is currently - so far as i know - absolutely no basis for any wide-ranging assumptions , " schäuble told südwestrundfunk radio . " we can not let ourselves become a divided society " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site visit by turkey 's erdogan shows the gravity of the case " i pray to heaven that it is not arson , " yasar bilgin , the head of the council of german-born turks , told the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine .
" such an act would be devastating for turks and germans who are expected to live side by side .
we can not let ourselves become a divided society . " mustafa baklan , who has become the unofficial spokesperson for the extended family whose members died in the fire , agreed . " germany is our home , " he told the web site .

the 320-member parliamentary assembly is made up of lawmakers from each of the osce 's 56 member states .

lennmarker 's letter followed a lengthy dispute between odihr and russian diplomats .
the odihr had stepped up pressure on moscow to allow its own observers into the country ahead of the election .
russia announced in late january that it was inviting 400 foreign monitors to observe the vote , but odihr has criticized " unprecedented restrictions " imposed on the observers .
repeat of earlier events earlier on thursday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia refused to comply with the conditions put forward by the odihr .
" this is called an ultimatum , " lavrov told reporters .
" self-respecting countries do not accept ultimatums . "
lavrov said that the osce had " impolitely " insisted on sending observers a month before the march 2 vote , and that this was unnecessary .
the odihr already boycotted russia 's december parliamentary election , saying proper observation was impossible under the conditions imposed by russia .

7 that it would not send a delegation to russia 's march 2 presidential election because of restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lennmarker made the osce decision final via official letter the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send the observers a full month in advance , a move opposed by russia .
" we regret that circumstances prevent us from observing this election , " osce spokesman spencer oliver told news agencies .
the president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly , goran lennmarker , wrote to the head of the russian state parliament , boris gryzlov , making the decision official .
" we unfortunately can not accept your invitation to send a limited number of observers to russia for the presidential election taking place on march 2 , " he said in the letter , released to the press .
russia deplores osce move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition groups say the presidential vote is rigged for medvedev , left russia , in return , criticized the decision .
" we believe the actions of the odihr are unacceptable , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in a statement .
" we can not but deeply regret this position , " he added .
the 320-member parliamentary assembly is made up of lawmakers from each of the osce 's 56 member states .
according to the watchdog 's website , its main aim is to improve dialogue between the parliaments of those member countries .
lennmarker 's letter followed a lengthy dispute between odihr and russian diplomats .
the odihr had stepped up pressure on moscow to allow its own observers into the country ahead of the election .
russia announced in late january that it was inviting 400 foreign monitors to observe the vote , but odihr has criticized " unprecedented restrictions " imposed on the observers .
repeat of earlier events earlier on thursday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia refused to comply with the conditions put forward by the odihr .
" this is called an ultimatum , " lavrov told reporters .
" self-respecting countries do not accept ultimatums . "
lavrov said that the osce had " impolitely " insisted on sending observers a month before the march 2 vote , and that this was unnecessary .
the odihr already boycotted russia 's december parliamentary election , saying proper observation was impossible under the conditions imposed by russia .
president vladimir putin , who is stepping down at the end of his second term , is expected to be replaced by his close ally dmitry medvedev in the presidential vote , which opposition groups say is being rigged . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with . " germany 's special role has definitely come to an end . " similarly , die welt wrote wednesday evening in its online edition that germany 's contribution to isaf is not a favor , but a duty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has insisted on more support from other nato partners " after ignoring for years the cries for help from the allies , it 's now high time that german politics came clean with the population about what 's necessary for a successful operation in hindu kush - that the bundeswehr 's main job is not civilian reconstruction but to militarily ensure security so that reconstruction is possible in the first place , " the paper opined . in light of a recent letter from us secretary of defense robert gates to jung with an explicit request for german troops in southern afghanistan , die welt said the us is not the only ally to exert pressure : " all the nato partners , like britain and the netherlands and especially from the canadians , who lost 60 men over a short time in hostilities with the taliban , " have pushed germany for more assistance . with its decision , " germany has crossed a magic line , " concluded the paper . " the growing criticism from the us , canada and britain over the german involvement in afghanistan is justified , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung commented thursday .
the paper added that " chancellor merkel does n't have much success to show , either militarily or in reconstruction . " the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .
" it is quickly sending combat troops because the norwegians are withdrawing their soldiers .
it 's filling holes that the czechs and danes left .
and more soldiers are being sent to kunduz because the situation there has worsened . " pressure to join the fighting in the south has only temporarily subsided .
but the majority wo n't accept that .
it can be expected instead that the government compromises in the north and increases its mandate where possible , " the paper concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .
full stop , " she said .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .
full stop , " she said .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with . " germany 's special role has definitely come to an end . " similarly , die welt wrote wednesday evening in its online edition that germany 's contribution to isaf is not a favor , but a duty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has insisted on more support from other nato partners " after ignoring for years the cries for help from the allies , it 's now high time that german politics came clean with the population about what 's necessary for a successful operation in hindu kush - that the bundeswehr 's main job is not civilian reconstruction but to militarily ensure security so that reconstruction is possible in the first place , " the paper opined . in light of a recent letter from us secretary of defense robert gates to jung with an explicit request for german troops in southern afghanistan , die welt said the us is not the only ally to exert pressure : " all the nato partners , like britain and the netherlands and especially from the canadians , who lost 60 men over a short time in hostilities with the taliban , " have pushed germany for more assistance . with its decision , " germany has crossed a magic line , " concluded the paper . " the growing criticism from the us , canada and britain over the german involvement in afghanistan is justified , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung commented thursday .
the paper added that " chancellor merkel does n't have much success to show , either militarily or in reconstruction . " the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .

germans and turks alike worry that the country is a social tinderbox , and the ludwigshafen fire the match that could set it alight . the event has revived memories of a firebomb attack by germans in 1993 on a house in solingen .
five turks were killed in that attack , which made international headlines .
about 2.5 million people of turkish decent call germany home , making them the largest minority in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and turkish officials visited the scene and called for calm during a visit to the site with mustafa sait yazicioglu , the turkish minister responsible for affairs involving turks living abroad , maria böhmer , the german commissioner for integration , urged caution ahead of the investigation . she called for restraint from the turkish press , which has been quick to speculate that neo-nazis were to blame for the blaze .
she also told reporters that a fireman who had helped put out the fire had been attacked by turkish youths the following tuesday . the fire broke out on sunday , feb .
5 .
it quickly engulfed the four-story building , which housed a turkish cultural center and the apartments of two turkish families , in smoke and flames . hate-graffiti and sniffer dogs people jumped for their lives from the burning building ; and in a dramatic scene , a 32-year-old man saved his infant nephew , onur , by throwing him to a policeman 23 feet below , who caught the child . nine people died in the fire , including five children and three mothers under 25 , one of whom was pregnant , a member of a local turkish community group said . two girls , aged 8 and 9 , have said they saw a man setting fire to something and throwing it into a baby stroller in the hallway of the building .
police were working with the witnesses to develop a sketch of the man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trained dogs have yet to find traces of arson it is hoped they will be able to recall enough to produce a portrait , police spokesman volker klein told the ap news service . " every clue is being taken seriously , " he said .
however , an initial search with sniffer dogs turned up no trace of substances that might have fed the fire . news agencies reported wednesday that neo-nazi graffiti was found scrawled on the entrance to a turkish cultural center that was in the building . the german word for hate , hass , was written twice on the wall , with the final two letters in the nazi " ss " rune script , police spokesman michael lindner said .
he said the graffiti must have been there before the fire because the building had been secured since the blaze on sunday . " if the factual cause of the fire is discovered and the necessary steps are taken , it will be easier for turkish people to be at peace , " yazicioglu said on a visit to the ruins of the block . turkish investigators , politicians on the scene authorities have already said that two small fires were started in the building in 2006 and added that they were quickly put out by residents .
it is not yet clear if they were related to the weekend 's fire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german fireman was attacked by turkish youths after the fire in an unusual move that reflects how much is at stake in the investigation , turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , traveling to germany for security conference , will visit the site of the fire on thursday .
turkey 's ambassador to germany and yazicioglu have also taken trips to ludwigshafen . moreover , turkish officials placed a team of four police officers from turkey be part of the team that investigates the fire , ostensibly to assure fairness in the investigation . " our people should not have any concerns about the investigation , " yazicioglu told turkish reporters after inspecting the site .
" the investigation will be concluded in a way that leaves no room for any doubt . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday urged people not to jump to any conclusions as to the cause . " it is terrible misfortune , it is really a catastrophe , but there is currently - so far as i know - absolutely no basis for any wide-ranging assumptions , " schäuble told südwestrundfunk radio . " we can not let ourselves become a divided society " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site visit by turkey 's erdogan shows the gravity of the case " i pray to heaven that it is not arson , " yasar bilgin , the head of the council of german-born turks , told the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine .
" such an act would be devastating for turks and germans who are expected to live side by side .
we can not let ourselves become a divided society . " mustafa baklan , who has become the unofficial spokesperson for the extended family whose members died in the fire , agreed . " germany is our home , " he told the web site .

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves . " on saturday , feb .

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.02.2008 turkish lawmakers vote to end headscarf ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will university students soon be allowed to wear headscarves in turkey ?
the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves . " on saturday , feb .

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

the odihr had stepped up pressure on moscow to allow its own observers into the country ahead of the election .
russia announced in late january that it was inviting 400 foreign monitors to observe the vote , but odihr has criticized " unprecedented restrictions " imposed on the observers .
repeat of earlier events earlier on thursday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia refused to comply with the conditions put forward by the odihr .
" this is called an ultimatum , " lavrov told reporters .
" self-respecting countries do not accept ultimatums . "
lavrov said that the osce had " impolitely " insisted on sending observers a month before the march 2 vote , and that this was unnecessary .
the odihr already boycotted russia 's december parliamentary election , saying proper observation was impossible under the conditions imposed by russia .

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves .

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with . " germany 's special role has definitely come to an end . " similarly , die welt wrote wednesday evening in its online edition that germany 's contribution to isaf is not a favor , but a duty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has insisted on more support from other nato partners " after ignoring for years the cries for help from the allies , it 's now high time that german politics came clean with the population about what 's necessary for a successful operation in hindu kush - that the bundeswehr 's main job is not civilian reconstruction but to militarily ensure security so that reconstruction is possible in the first place , " the paper opined . in light of a recent letter from us secretary of defense robert gates to jung with an explicit request for german troops in southern afghanistan , die welt said the us is not the only ally to exert pressure : " all the nato partners , like britain and the netherlands and especially from the canadians , who lost 60 men over a short time in hostilities with the taliban , " have pushed germany for more assistance . with its decision , " germany has crossed a magic line , " concluded the paper . " the growing criticism from the us , canada and britain over the german involvement in afghanistan is justified , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung commented thursday .
the paper added that " chancellor merkel does n't have much success to show , either militarily or in reconstruction . " the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .
" it is quickly sending combat troops because the norwegians are withdrawing their soldiers .
it 's filling holes that the czechs and danes left .
and more soldiers are being sent to kunduz because the situation there has worsened . " pressure to join the fighting in the south has only temporarily subsided .
but the majority wo n't accept that .
it can be expected instead that the government compromises in the north and increases its mandate where possible , " the paper concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with . " germany 's special role has definitely come to an end . " similarly , die welt wrote wednesday evening in its online edition that germany 's contribution to isaf is not a favor , but a duty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has insisted on more support from other nato partners " after ignoring for years the cries for help from the allies , it 's now high time that german politics came clean with the population about what 's necessary for a successful operation in hindu kush - that the bundeswehr 's main job is not civilian reconstruction but to militarily ensure security so that reconstruction is possible in the first place , " the paper opined . in light of a recent letter from us secretary of defense robert gates to jung with an explicit request for german troops in southern afghanistan , die welt said the us is not the only ally to exert pressure : " all the nato partners , like britain and the netherlands and especially from the canadians , who lost 60 men over a short time in hostilities with the taliban , " have pushed germany for more assistance . with its decision , " germany has crossed a magic line , " concluded the paper . " the growing criticism from the us , canada and britain over the german involvement in afghanistan is justified , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung commented thursday .
the paper added that " chancellor merkel does n't have much success to show , either militarily or in reconstruction . " the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .
" it is quickly sending combat troops because the norwegians are withdrawing their soldiers .
it 's filling holes that the czechs and danes left .
and more soldiers are being sent to kunduz because the situation there has worsened . " pressure to join the fighting in the south has only temporarily subsided .
but the majority wo n't accept that .
it can be expected instead that the government compromises in the north and increases its mandate where possible , " the paper concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .

trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .

problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.02.2008 turkish lawmakers vote to end headscarf ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will university students soon be allowed to wear headscarves in turkey ?
the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves . " on saturday , feb .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .

trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .

the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves .

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with . " germany 's special role has definitely come to an end . " similarly , die welt wrote wednesday evening in its online edition that germany 's contribution to isaf is not a favor , but a duty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has insisted on more support from other nato partners " after ignoring for years the cries for help from the allies , it 's now high time that german politics came clean with the population about what 's necessary for a successful operation in hindu kush - that the bundeswehr 's main job is not civilian reconstruction but to militarily ensure security so that reconstruction is possible in the first place , " the paper opined . in light of a recent letter from us secretary of defense robert gates to jung with an explicit request for german troops in southern afghanistan , die welt said the us is not the only ally to exert pressure : " all the nato partners , like britain and the netherlands and especially from the canadians , who lost 60 men over a short time in hostilities with the taliban , " have pushed germany for more assistance . with its decision , " germany has crossed a magic line , " concluded the paper . " the growing criticism from the us , canada and britain over the german involvement in afghanistan is justified , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung commented thursday .
the paper added that " chancellor merkel does n't have much success to show , either militarily or in reconstruction . " the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .
" it is quickly sending combat troops because the norwegians are withdrawing their soldiers .
it 's filling holes that the czechs and danes left .
and more soldiers are being sent to kunduz because the situation there has worsened . " pressure to join the fighting in the south has only temporarily subsided .
but the majority wo n't accept that .
it can be expected instead that the government compromises in the north and increases its mandate where possible , " the paper concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 320-member parliamentary assembly is made up of lawmakers from each of the osce 's 56 member states .
according to the watchdog 's website , its main aim is to improve dialogue between the parliaments of those member countries .
lennmarker 's letter followed a lengthy dispute between odihr and russian diplomats .
the odihr had stepped up pressure on moscow to allow its own observers into the country ahead of the election .
russia announced in late january that it was inviting 400 foreign monitors to observe the vote , but odihr has criticized " unprecedented restrictions " imposed on the observers .
repeat of earlier events earlier on thursday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia refused to comply with the conditions put forward by the odihr .
" this is called an ultimatum , " lavrov told reporters .
" self-respecting countries do not accept ultimatums . "
lavrov said that the osce had " impolitely " insisted on sending observers a month before the march 2 vote , and that this was unnecessary .
the odihr already boycotted russia 's december parliamentary election , saying proper observation was impossible under the conditions imposed by russia .
president vladimir putin , who is stepping down at the end of his second term , is expected to be replaced by his close ally dmitry medvedev in the presidential vote , which opposition groups say is being rigged . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 07.02.2008 russians take new beachhead in british-german towel war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime real estate goes to the first to arrive - or pay when it comes to the fight between germans and brits for poolside seats at holiday resorts , the " battle of the deck chairs " has been a little bit like the battle of ypres - endless , repetitive , and often bloody . now , tourism insiders are warning that the arrival of eastern european sun-seekers in western resorts could boost the body count in the beach-towel wars .
according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .
may the better win . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.02.2008 turkish lawmakers vote to end headscarf ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will university students soon be allowed to wear headscarves in turkey ?
the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .
the headscarf ban , which the akp party aims to rescind , is hot political topic in the country . some liberal turks consider wearing a headscarf to be a voice in favor of an islamic state . women 's-rights issue , or islamification ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 125,000 demonstrated against lifiting the ban the government has argued that the changes are a women 's-rights issue .
however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves . " on saturday , feb .

according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .
full stop , " she said .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .
" they need to make sure that toys are age appropriate , " ellis said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .

the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves .

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .

however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .

trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .
full stop , " she said .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .
may the better win . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans and turks alike worry that the country is a social tinderbox , and the ludwigshafen fire the match that could set it alight . the event has revived memories of a firebomb attack by germans in 1993 on a house in solingen .
five turks were killed in that attack , which made international headlines .
about 2.5 million people of turkish decent call germany home , making them the largest minority in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and turkish officials visited the scene and called for calm during a visit to the site with mustafa sait yazicioglu , the turkish minister responsible for affairs involving turks living abroad , maria böhmer , the german commissioner for integration , urged caution ahead of the investigation . she called for restraint from the turkish press , which has been quick to speculate that neo-nazis were to blame for the blaze .
she also told reporters that a fireman who had helped put out the fire had been attacked by turkish youths the following tuesday . the fire broke out on sunday , feb .
5 .
it quickly engulfed the four-story building , which housed a turkish cultural center and the apartments of two turkish families , in smoke and flames . hate-graffiti and sniffer dogs people jumped for their lives from the burning building ; and in a dramatic scene , a 32-year-old man saved his infant nephew , onur , by throwing him to a policeman 23 feet below , who caught the child . nine people died in the fire , including five children and three mothers under 25 , one of whom was pregnant , a member of a local turkish community group said . two girls , aged 8 and 9 , have said they saw a man setting fire to something and throwing it into a baby stroller in the hallway of the building .
police were working with the witnesses to develop a sketch of the man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trained dogs have yet to find traces of arson it is hoped they will be able to recall enough to produce a portrait , police spokesman volker klein told the ap news service . " every clue is being taken seriously , " he said .
however , an initial search with sniffer dogs turned up no trace of substances that might have fed the fire . news agencies reported wednesday that neo-nazi graffiti was found scrawled on the entrance to a turkish cultural center that was in the building . the german word for hate , hass , was written twice on the wall , with the final two letters in the nazi " ss " rune script , police spokesman michael lindner said .
he said the graffiti must have been there before the fire because the building had been secured since the blaze on sunday . " if the factual cause of the fire is discovered and the necessary steps are taken , it will be easier for turkish people to be at peace , " yazicioglu said on a visit to the ruins of the block . turkish investigators , politicians on the scene authorities have already said that two small fires were started in the building in 2006 and added that they were quickly put out by residents .
it is not yet clear if they were related to the weekend 's fire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german fireman was attacked by turkish youths after the fire in an unusual move that reflects how much is at stake in the investigation , turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , traveling to germany for security conference , will visit the site of the fire on thursday .
turkey 's ambassador to germany and yazicioglu have also taken trips to ludwigshafen . moreover , turkish officials placed a team of four police officers from turkey be part of the team that investigates the fire , ostensibly to assure fairness in the investigation . " our people should not have any concerns about the investigation , " yazicioglu told turkish reporters after inspecting the site .
" the investigation will be concluded in a way that leaves no room for any doubt . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday urged people not to jump to any conclusions as to the cause . " it is terrible misfortune , it is really a catastrophe , but there is currently - so far as i know - absolutely no basis for any wide-ranging assumptions , " schäuble told südwestrundfunk radio . " we can not let ourselves become a divided society " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site visit by turkey 's erdogan shows the gravity of the case " i pray to heaven that it is not arson , " yasar bilgin , the head of the council of german-born turks , told the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine .
" such an act would be devastating for turks and germans who are expected to live side by side .
we can not let ourselves become a divided society . " mustafa baklan , who has become the unofficial spokesperson for the extended family whose members died in the fire , agreed . " germany is our home , " he told the web site .

we do n't want to place blame ; we have to deal with this horrible situation together .

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .
may the better win . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

germans and turks alike worry that the country is a social tinderbox , and the ludwigshafen fire the match that could set it alight . the event has revived memories of a firebomb attack by germans in 1993 on a house in solingen .
five turks were killed in that attack , which made international headlines .
about 2.5 million people of turkish decent call germany home , making them the largest minority in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and turkish officials visited the scene and called for calm during a visit to the site with mustafa sait yazicioglu , the turkish minister responsible for affairs involving turks living abroad , maria böhmer , the german commissioner for integration , urged caution ahead of the investigation . she called for restraint from the turkish press , which has been quick to speculate that neo-nazis were to blame for the blaze .
she also told reporters that a fireman who had helped put out the fire had been attacked by turkish youths the following tuesday . the fire broke out on sunday , feb .
5 .
it quickly engulfed the four-story building , which housed a turkish cultural center and the apartments of two turkish families , in smoke and flames . hate-graffiti and sniffer dogs people jumped for their lives from the burning building ; and in a dramatic scene , a 32-year-old man saved his infant nephew , onur , by throwing him to a policeman 23 feet below , who caught the child . nine people died in the fire , including five children and three mothers under 25 , one of whom was pregnant , a member of a local turkish community group said . two girls , aged 8 and 9 , have said they saw a man setting fire to something and throwing it into a baby stroller in the hallway of the building .
police were working with the witnesses to develop a sketch of the man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trained dogs have yet to find traces of arson it is hoped they will be able to recall enough to produce a portrait , police spokesman volker klein told the ap news service . " every clue is being taken seriously , " he said .
however , an initial search with sniffer dogs turned up no trace of substances that might have fed the fire . news agencies reported wednesday that neo-nazi graffiti was found scrawled on the entrance to a turkish cultural center that was in the building . the german word for hate , hass , was written twice on the wall , with the final two letters in the nazi " ss " rune script , police spokesman michael lindner said .
he said the graffiti must have been there before the fire because the building had been secured since the blaze on sunday . " if the factual cause of the fire is discovered and the necessary steps are taken , it will be easier for turkish people to be at peace , " yazicioglu said on a visit to the ruins of the block . turkish investigators , politicians on the scene authorities have already said that two small fires were started in the building in 2006 and added that they were quickly put out by residents .
it is not yet clear if they were related to the weekend 's fire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german fireman was attacked by turkish youths after the fire in an unusual move that reflects how much is at stake in the investigation , turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , traveling to germany for security conference , will visit the site of the fire on thursday .
turkey 's ambassador to germany and yazicioglu have also taken trips to ludwigshafen . moreover , turkish officials placed a team of four police officers from turkey be part of the team that investigates the fire , ostensibly to assure fairness in the investigation . " our people should not have any concerns about the investigation , " yazicioglu told turkish reporters after inspecting the site .
" the investigation will be concluded in a way that leaves no room for any doubt . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday urged people not to jump to any conclusions as to the cause . " it is terrible misfortune , it is really a catastrophe , but there is currently - so far as i know - absolutely no basis for any wide-ranging assumptions , " schäuble told südwestrundfunk radio . " we can not let ourselves become a divided society " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site visit by turkey 's erdogan shows the gravity of the case " i pray to heaven that it is not arson , " yasar bilgin , the head of the council of german-born turks , told the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine .
" such an act would be devastating for turks and germans who are expected to live side by side .
we can not let ourselves become a divided society . " mustafa baklan , who has become the unofficial spokesperson for the extended family whose members died in the fire , agreed . " germany is our home , " he told the web site .
" we do n't want any harassment .
we do n't want to place blame ; we have to deal with this horrible situation together .

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states .

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with . " germany 's special role has definitely come to an end . " similarly , die welt wrote wednesday evening in its online edition that germany 's contribution to isaf is not a favor , but a duty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has insisted on more support from other nato partners " after ignoring for years the cries for help from the allies , it 's now high time that german politics came clean with the population about what 's necessary for a successful operation in hindu kush - that the bundeswehr 's main job is not civilian reconstruction but to militarily ensure security so that reconstruction is possible in the first place , " the paper opined . in light of a recent letter from us secretary of defense robert gates to jung with an explicit request for german troops in southern afghanistan , die welt said the us is not the only ally to exert pressure : " all the nato partners , like britain and the netherlands and especially from the canadians , who lost 60 men over a short time in hostilities with the taliban , " have pushed germany for more assistance . with its decision , " germany has crossed a magic line , " concluded the paper . " the growing criticism from the us , canada and britain over the german involvement in afghanistan is justified , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung commented thursday .
the paper added that " chancellor merkel does n't have much success to show , either militarily or in reconstruction . " the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .
" it is quickly sending combat troops because the norwegians are withdrawing their soldiers .
it 's filling holes that the czechs and danes left .
and more soldiers are being sent to kunduz because the situation there has worsened . " pressure to join the fighting in the south has only temporarily subsided .
but the majority wo n't accept that .
it can be expected instead that the government compromises in the north and increases its mandate where possible , " the paper concluded . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .

" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .

trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .

" our people should not have any concerns about the investigation , " yazicioglu told turkish reporters after inspecting the site .
" the investigation will be concluded in a way that leaves no room for any doubt . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday urged people not to jump to any conclusions as to the cause .

it quickly engulfed the four-story building , which housed a turkish cultural center and the apartments of two turkish families , in smoke and flames . hate-graffiti and sniffer dogs people jumped for their lives from the burning building ; and in a dramatic scene , a 32-year-old man saved his infant nephew , onur , by throwing him to a policeman 23 feet below , who caught the child . nine people died in the fire , including five children and three mothers under 25 , one of whom was pregnant , a member of a local turkish community group said . two girls , aged 8 and 9 , have said they saw a man setting fire to something and throwing it into a baby stroller in the hallway of the building .
police were working with the witnesses to develop a sketch of the man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trained dogs have yet to find traces of arson it is hoped they will be able to recall enough to produce a portrait , police spokesman volker klein told the ap news service . " every clue is being taken seriously , " he said .
however , an initial search with sniffer dogs turned up no trace of substances that might have fed the fire . news agencies reported wednesday that neo-nazi graffiti was found scrawled on the entrance to a turkish cultural center that was in the building . the german word for hate , hass , was written twice on the wall , with the final two letters in the nazi " ss " rune script , police spokesman michael lindner said .
he said the graffiti must have been there before the fire because the building had been secured since the blaze on sunday . " if the factual cause of the fire is discovered and the necessary steps are taken , it will be easier for turkish people to be at peace , " yazicioglu said on a visit to the ruins of the block . turkish investigators , politicians on the scene authorities have already said that two small fires were started in the building in 2006 and added that they were quickly put out by residents .
it is not yet clear if they were related to the weekend 's fire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german fireman was attacked by turkish youths after the fire in an unusual move that reflects how much is at stake in the investigation , turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , traveling to germany for security conference , will visit the site of the fire on thursday .
turkey 's ambassador to germany and yazicioglu have also taken trips to ludwigshafen . moreover , turkish officials placed a team of four police officers from turkey be part of the team that investigates the fire , ostensibly to assure fairness in the investigation . " our people should not have any concerns about the investigation , " yazicioglu told turkish reporters after inspecting the site .
" the investigation will be concluded in a way that leaves no room for any doubt . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday urged people not to jump to any conclusions as to the cause . " it is terrible misfortune , it is really a catastrophe , but there is currently - so far as i know - absolutely no basis for any wide-ranging assumptions , " schäuble told südwestrundfunk radio . " we can not let ourselves become a divided society " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site visit by turkey 's erdogan shows the gravity of the case " i pray to heaven that it is not arson , " yasar bilgin , the head of the council of german-born turks , told the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine .
" such an act would be devastating for turks and germans who are expected to live side by side .
we can not let ourselves become a divided society . " mustafa baklan , who has become the unofficial spokesperson for the extended family whose members died in the fire , agreed . " germany is our home , " he told the web site .

7 that it would not send a delegation to russia 's march 2 presidential election because of restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lennmarker made the osce decision final via official letter the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send the observers a full month in advance , a move opposed by russia .
" we regret that circumstances prevent us from observing this election , " osce spokesman spencer oliver told news agencies .
the president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly , goran lennmarker , wrote to the head of the russian state parliament , boris gryzlov , making the decision official .
" we unfortunately can not accept your invitation to send a limited number of observers to russia for the presidential election taking place on march 2 , " he said in the letter , released to the press .
russia deplores osce move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition groups say the presidential vote is rigged for medvedev , left russia , in return , criticized the decision .
" we believe the actions of the odihr are unacceptable , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in a statement .
" we can not but deeply regret this position , " he added .
the 320-member parliamentary assembly is made up of lawmakers from each of the osce 's 56 member states .
according to the watchdog 's website , its main aim is to improve dialogue between the parliaments of those member countries .
lennmarker 's letter followed a lengthy dispute between odihr and russian diplomats .
the odihr had stepped up pressure on moscow to allow its own observers into the country ahead of the election .
russia announced in late january that it was inviting 400 foreign monitors to observe the vote , but odihr has criticized " unprecedented restrictions " imposed on the observers .
repeat of earlier events earlier on thursday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia refused to comply with the conditions put forward by the odihr .
" this is called an ultimatum , " lavrov told reporters .
" self-respecting countries do not accept ultimatums . "

" we regret that circumstances prevent us from observing this election , " osce spokesman spencer oliver told news agencies .
the president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly , goran lennmarker , wrote to the head of the russian state parliament , boris gryzlov , making the decision official .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan gates presses europeans to back afghan mission opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan afghanistan -pipe- 07.02.2008 germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mission in afghanistan is a team effort german defense minister franz josef jung on thursday , dec .
7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .
more than manpower needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops from 40 nations are part of the nato force in afghanistan besides troops , nato also lacks heavy transport aircraft , helicopters and unmanned spy aircraft , ministers said on thursday .
ministers also agreed that nato is in afghanistan for the long haul .
while many participants expressed " cautious optimism " over the progress in bringing stability to the country , there was also an agreement that more troops , equipment and training of afghan military would be necessary before nato handed over the mission to local security forces .
analysts at the nato defense college issued a report in january - based on the conclusions of a seminar of nato officials , military commanders , diplomats and security experts - which highlighted the high stakes placed on afghanistan .
" from a us perspective , afghanistan is a ' make or break issue ' , " the report said . " a perceived failure would be blamed primarily on insufficient european engagement in the region .

according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .
full stop , " she said .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .
" they need to make sure that toys are age appropriate , " ellis said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans and turks alike worry that the country is a social tinderbox , and the ludwigshafen fire the match that could set it alight . the event has revived memories of a firebomb attack by germans in 1993 on a house in solingen .
five turks were killed in that attack , which made international headlines .

it quickly engulfed the four-story building , which housed a turkish cultural center and the apartments of two turkish families , in smoke and flames . hate-graffiti and sniffer dogs people jumped for their lives from the burning building ; and in a dramatic scene , a 32-year-old man saved his infant nephew , onur , by throwing him to a policeman 23 feet below , who caught the child . nine people died in the fire , including five children and three mothers under 25 , one of whom was pregnant , a member of a local turkish community group said . two girls , aged 8 and 9 , have said they saw a man setting fire to something and throwing it into a baby stroller in the hallway of the building .
police were working with the witnesses to develop a sketch of the man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trained dogs have yet to find traces of arson it is hoped they will be able to recall enough to produce a portrait , police spokesman volker klein told the ap news service . " every clue is being taken seriously , " he said .
however , an initial search with sniffer dogs turned up no trace of substances that might have fed the fire . news agencies reported wednesday that neo-nazi graffiti was found scrawled on the entrance to a turkish cultural center that was in the building . the german word for hate , hass , was written twice on the wall , with the final two letters in the nazi " ss " rune script , police spokesman michael lindner said .
he said the graffiti must have been there before the fire because the building had been secured since the blaze on sunday . " if the factual cause of the fire is discovered and the necessary steps are taken , it will be easier for turkish people to be at peace , " yazicioglu said on a visit to the ruins of the block . turkish investigators , politicians on the scene authorities have already said that two small fires were started in the building in 2006 and added that they were quickly put out by residents .
it is not yet clear if they were related to the weekend 's fire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german fireman was attacked by turkish youths after the fire in an unusual move that reflects how much is at stake in the investigation , turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , traveling to germany for security conference , will visit the site of the fire on thursday .
turkey 's ambassador to germany and yazicioglu have also taken trips to ludwigshafen . moreover , turkish officials placed a team of four police officers from turkey be part of the team that investigates the fire , ostensibly to assure fairness in the investigation . " our people should not have any concerns about the investigation , " yazicioglu told turkish reporters after inspecting the site .
" the investigation will be concluded in a way that leaves no room for any doubt . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday urged people not to jump to any conclusions as to the cause . " it is terrible misfortune , it is really a catastrophe , but there is currently - so far as i know - absolutely no basis for any wide-ranging assumptions , " schäuble told südwestrundfunk radio . " we can not let ourselves become a divided society " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site visit by turkey 's erdogan shows the gravity of the case " i pray to heaven that it is not arson , " yasar bilgin , the head of the council of german-born turks , told the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine .
" such an act would be devastating for turks and germans who are expected to live side by side .
we can not let ourselves become a divided society . " mustafa baklan , who has become the unofficial spokesperson for the extended family whose members died in the fire , agreed . " germany is our home , " he told the web site .

7 , flatly rejected us criticism that germany and other nato countries are n't willing to be full partners in the alliance 's mission to afghanistan . " in my opinion our contribution is excellent , " jung said in vilnius , lithuania , where 25 nato defense ministers gathered for a two-day meeting on thursday .
" we are the third largest contributor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung defended germany 's contribution to the mission germany has 3,200 peacekeeping troops deployed in the relatively peaceful northern afghanistan .
the us has 15,000 troops and britain has 7,000 .
the nato-led isaf force has altogether 43,000 troops in the country .
germany agreed on wednesday to deploy about 250 combat soldiers as part of a nato quick reaction force . the troops would be stationed in the north , but could be called to help in other regions in an emergency .
the us insists , however , that the real concern is n't about troop numbers , but the refusal of some countries to allow troops to be stationed in the more volatile southern afghanistan .
four nato member states - the us , britain , canada and the netherlands - are doing nearly all of the fighting against taliban rebels in the south .
those countries want reinforcements from their nato allies .
pressure is on if more countries do n't begin sharing the burden of combat in afghanistan , us defense secretary robert gates warned late on wednesday that nato could devolve into a " two-tiered alliance " clouding nato 's future .
" my view is you ca n't have some allies whose sons and daughters die in combat and other allies who are shielded from that kind of a sacrifice , " he told the us house of representatives armed services committee .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also kept up pressure on reluctant allies during a trip with british foreign secretary david miliband visiting troops fighting the taliban .
" frankly , i hope there will be more troop contributions and there needs to be more afghan forces , " rice told reporters thursday .
canada considering pullout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called for more troops in kandahar canada , which has 2,500 troops in the kandahar province , has said it might pull out entirely if other countries do n't help .
canada 's minority government has scheduled a parliamentary vote of confidence in late march on whether to prolong its military mission in afghanistan , officials said on wednesday .
" what we want to see is more of a one-for-all approach , that includes of course burden sharing in the south , " canada 's defense minister peter mackay said before the meeting in lithuania .
in particular , the us is applying pressure to germany , france , italy and spain to send troops to southern afghanistan .
france could send more troops there 's general recognition among nato defense ministers that there 's a shortfall of troops in afghanistan .
but there 's no indication that the meeting on thursday and friday in lithuania will produce further commitments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us wants more countries to send troops to south the talks in vilnius are " not about getting commitments from ministers to send troops , " said nato spokesman james apparthurai .
but he added that " hopefully we will see nations come forward with further offers as quickly as possible . "
in paris , a spokesman for president nicolas sarkozy said france was considering sending more troops to afghanistan .
he did not confirm that 700 paratroopers would be deployed to the south , as was reported by french media .
" these are issues that are being examined , " sarkozy 's spokesman david martinon said of possible new deployments .
" to my knowledge no decision has been reached yet . "
mending fences nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer tried to play down talk of a damaging split within the organization .
bildunterschrift : meeting of the ministers " i do not see a two-tier alliance , there is one alliance , " scheffer told reporters as he arrived in vilnius .
he specifically thanked germany for its contributions to the afghanistan mission and said that other governments should save discussions of reinforcements for private sessions .
" i believe that germany is doing a good job .
i know the german parliament wants some limits -lrb- on where it deploys its troops -rrb- .
i want maximum flexibility in afghanistan with all allies , " scheffer said .
dutch defense minister eimert van middelkoop said that there was a " healthy tension " over the issue , and that gates was using his " right to remind the alliance " of the problem .

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .

if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .

however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves .

the turkish parliament early on thursday morning approved changing the constitution in the first-stage of a two-round vote to lift a ban on wearing islamic headscarves at universities . after a sometimes raucous debate lasting more than 12 hours , 404 deputies in the 550-seat parliament voted in favor of an overall motion changing two articles of the constitution .
the parliament had earlier voted on individual points of the proposed changes . with all of the changes expected to pass , the parliament will convene again on saturday for a final round of voting on the measures . the move to allow the islamic head-coverings comes after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's islamic-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- was returned to power last year in early elections forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul - whose wife wears a headscarf - for the presidency . meanwhile , some 200 demonstrators had gathered near the parliament building to protest the plan .

however , opponents , including army generals , judges and university rectors , said they see the move as part of a creeping islamification of turkish society and that erdogan 's government ultimately seeks to impose shariah law . the government also points to public-opinion polls - the latest from metropoll research showed 65 per cent of turks support lifting the bans - as evidence that the moves are democratic . establishment groups such as the judiciary , top business groups and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions .
the staunchly-secularist military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully . wearing of the headscarf in universities was first banned after the 1980 military coup but it was not until the late 1990s that the ban was strictly enforced . demonstrators oppose the measure rather than take off their head coverings many devout islamic women have refused to go to university and some , including erdogan 's daughters , have studied abroad to get around the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers , not students , wear headscarves in istanbul the move to allow the head-covering comes after erdogan 's akp was returned to power last year in early elections that were forced following a series of spats with secularists over the nomination of abdullah gul , whose wife wears a headscarf , for the presidency . the demonstrators who met near the parliament building yelled slogans like , " down with the akp " and " we wo n't allow headscarves .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "

trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .

trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .
full stop , " she said .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .
" they need to make sure that toys are age appropriate , " ellis said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's defense minister franz-josef jung on wednesday , feb .
6 , announced that he would send over 200 bundeswehr combat troops to northern afghanistan .
the german media was split on the decision . " germany has to send 200 more soldiers to afghanistan , " the mass-market bild zeitung wrote on thursday .
" it 's no reason to celebrate - but it 's a responsible decision . … it overturns the picture that the government has painted so far of the afghanistan mission - of a military mission that could somehow be different , somehow more civil than the big nato states . " defense minister jung " does n't want to call -lsb- the new mission -rsb- what it is , " the widely-read tabloid continued , " but clear language should have been used so that citizens will unmistakably know what the soldiers are dealing with . " germany 's special role has definitely come to an end . " similarly , die welt wrote wednesday evening in its online edition that germany 's contribution to isaf is not a favor , but a duty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has insisted on more support from other nato partners " after ignoring for years the cries for help from the allies , it 's now high time that german politics came clean with the population about what 's necessary for a successful operation in hindu kush - that the bundeswehr 's main job is not civilian reconstruction but to militarily ensure security so that reconstruction is possible in the first place , " the paper opined . in light of a recent letter from us secretary of defense robert gates to jung with an explicit request for german troops in southern afghanistan , die welt said the us is not the only ally to exert pressure : " all the nato partners , like britain and the netherlands and especially from the canadians , who lost 60 men over a short time in hostilities with the taliban , " have pushed germany for more assistance . with its decision , " germany has crossed a magic line , " concluded the paper . " the growing criticism from the us , canada and britain over the german involvement in afghanistan is justified , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung commented thursday .
the paper added that " chancellor merkel does n't have much success to show , either militarily or in reconstruction . " the daily criticized the breadth of the mission , saying that 3,000 bundeswehr soldiers in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan and 60 police trainers were not enough . " apparently , the social democratic party and the christian democratic union would , for domestic reasons , prefer to let the nato alliance and 24 million afghans slide deeper into crisis than massively expand the german mission to hindu kush , " the paper noted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is dependent on peace and stability writing thursday from berlin , the tageszeitung said germany should fight for a new afghanistan strategy at the upcoming nato summit in april . " it should absolutely be expected that the government has the maturity to discuss the afghanistan mission plainly with the parliament and the interested part of the public , " the paper wrote .
" in doing so , it may be said that germany should have the maturity to shift the course of the afghanistan mandate within nato : more civilian reconstruction , less military . " first of all , germany should take responsibility for the promises it made a long time ago .
those who want to achieve a civil afghanistan also have to train their police - as promised , " the tageszeitung opined . " the bundeswehr has to fill in the gaps everywhere , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung thursday from munich .
" it is quickly sending combat troops because the norwegians are withdrawing their soldiers .
it 's filling holes that the czechs and danes left .
and more soldiers are being sent to kunduz because the situation there has worsened . " pressure to join the fighting in the south has only temporarily subsided .

7 that it would not send a delegation to russia 's march 2 presidential election because of restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lennmarker made the osce decision final via official letter the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send the observers a full month in advance , a move opposed by russia .
" we regret that circumstances prevent us from observing this election , " osce spokesman spencer oliver told news agencies .
the president of the osce 's parliamentary assembly , goran lennmarker , wrote to the head of the russian state parliament , boris gryzlov , making the decision official .
" we unfortunately can not accept your invitation to send a limited number of observers to russia for the presidential election taking place on march 2 , " he said in the letter , released to the press .
russia deplores osce move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition groups say the presidential vote is rigged for medvedev , left russia , in return , criticized the decision .
" we believe the actions of the odihr are unacceptable , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in a statement .
" we can not but deeply regret this position , " he added .
the 320-member parliamentary assembly is made up of lawmakers from each of the osce 's 56 member states .
according to the watchdog 's website , its main aim is to improve dialogue between the parliaments of those member countries .
lennmarker 's letter followed a lengthy dispute between odihr and russian diplomats .
the odihr had stepped up pressure on moscow to allow its own observers into the country ahead of the election .
russia announced in late january that it was inviting 400 foreign monitors to observe the vote , but odihr has criticized " unprecedented restrictions " imposed on the observers .
repeat of earlier events earlier on thursday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia refused to comply with the conditions put forward by the odihr .
" this is called an ultimatum , " lavrov told reporters .
" self-respecting countries do not accept ultimatums . "
lavrov said that the osce had " impolitely " insisted on sending observers a month before the march 2 vote , and that this was unnecessary .
the odihr already boycotted russia 's december parliamentary election , saying proper observation was impossible under the conditions imposed by russia .
president vladimir putin , who is stepping down at the end of his second term , is expected to be replaced by his close ally dmitry medvedev in the presidential vote , which opposition groups say is being rigged . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , consumer groups and manufacturers disagreed on whether the announced overhaul of eu toy safety rules went far enough . even before the mattel scandal broke out last summer - when the us toymaker voluntarily recalled over 18 million chinese-made products worldwide , ranging from barbie dolls to lead-tainted play cars - eu regulators were feverishly working on overhauling a 20-year-old directive aimed at guaranteeing a high level of safety in toys sold in the 27-member bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu directive covers potentially dangerous magnetic parts " we have a far greater awareness of chemical risks today than twenty years ago , " said laura degaillaix , a biochemist and policy advisor to beuc , the european consumer 's organization in brussels .
the european commission announced in late january that it wanted to cut the level of lead and other toxic substances that provoke cancer , genetic mutations or hormonal changes in addition to banning fragrances in modeling clay and children 's cosmetics that could trigger allergic reactions .
safety first phthalates , the most common chemical compound used to mold the plastic content of toys , for example can be harmful in the same way that asbestos exposure increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer .
which is why the commission plans to ban three phthalates and partially ban three more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can internal substances migrate to the surface of a toy ?
" unfortunately , this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said degaillaix .
" other chemicals that have not been banned carry similar risks .
there are too many loopholes that allow toy manufacturers to get around these bans . "
one big problem is that the new proposals prohibit certain phthalates and carcinogens only in the accessible part of a toy .
but , according to degaillaix , that is not enough .
" imagine a soft plushy ball that undergoes a lot of wear and tear , " she said .
" moisture from a baby 's mouth makes the ball porous , causing internal toxins to rise to the surface . "
monique goyens , the director general of beuc said that there are alternative materials that are more child friendly .
" lead for example is not needed at all for paint in toys , and carcinogenic materials should not be used at all .
full stop , " she said .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular chocolate eggs with a surprise toy inside will not be affected by new eu initiative toy industries of europe -lrb- tie -rrb- , an action group in brussels that represents lego and the european divisions of us giants such as mattel and hasbro has argued , however , that the industry is continuously seeking global solutions to raise the bar on toy safety and that its corporate members go further than the legal minimum required to ensure that their products are safe . bryan ellis , who is chairman of tie and an independent consultant for hasbro , said that the new european commission directive is a reasonable compromise between what manufacturers are capable of achieving and the public interest .
trace elements of chemicals are inevitably locked into a product , and this applies not only to toys , but to other objects that small children put into their mouths , said ellis .
" the technical problem is that trace elements are extremely difficult to measure and the amounts are so miniscule that they pose no possible harm to the public , " said ellis .
problems with counterfeit toys entering eu market " the problems lie with peripheral importers in china and elsewhere , in particular with counterfeit products coming into europe , " said ellis , adding that this is a global problem that requires the proper checks and balances at every stage of the manufacturing process and careful monitoring at eu ports of entry .
according to european industry figures , china accounted for over 80 % of all imports from non-eu countries in 2005 .
" the most important thing for toy companies is branding and reputation .
we clearly have a very strong commercial interest in producing safe products , but the standards that we are required to meet need to be practical , necessary and doable , " he said .
not least , parents and caregivers too need to take responsibility for keeping dangerous toys out of the hands of small children .
" they need to make sure that toys are age appropriate , " ellis said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to british travel web site lastminute.com , russians are the " new germans " when it comes to bagging the best poolside or beachfront sunning spots at southern resorts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may not look like it , but these sunbathers are fighting a war but first , a little military history . among europeans , germans are known - and either despised or grudgingly admired - for the advanced tactics they use to capture coveted territory .
this includes such classics as the frühaufsteher badehandtuch manoeuvre , in which a german wakes up long before dawn and drapes a towel over a particularly coveted lounge chair , before returning to bed for a few hours . but the russians , drawing on a long and exalted military history of their own , are making swift inroads .
according to lastminute.com managing director john bevan , the russians are routing their opponents by employing highly dangerous secret weapons - their wallets .
no more cold war the collapse of communism in russia had led to the growing russian middle class spending oodles of nouveau-cash on holidays , bevan said .
their " brash " strategy of " flashing their new-found wealth and paying hotel staff to reserve them the best beds " makes them popular with the hard-working employees , he said . it also insures that they win at least a few battles , if not the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has resorted to scaring off opponents with " shark sighting " warnings - yet " the battle for europe 's sun beds will be more intense than ever this summer as the russians establish themselves as the most prominent outbound tourism market in europe , " he told afp news service .
if germans want to reclaim their former , hard-earned fame , they will have to work out a new strategy for standing up against russian insolence .
that 's why the much trumpeted euro 2008 soccer championship , which will be hosted by land-locked switzerland and austria in june , may in the end turn out to be a flop . the real war - with water pistols , fluorescent tanga thongs and possible sun-baked nudity - will be waged on european beaches .

rhondda-born jimmy murphy , assistant to matt busby was called to the manager 's hospital bed in germany and urged to " keep the flag flying " .
eight players died after the crash on 6 february , 1958 , but the team would be back on the pitch just 13 days later .
murphy 's son jimmy jr said : " it must have been horrendous for him . "
his father would have been on the fateful flight returning from belgrade , but for his other role as wales manager .
murphy had stayed behind for a world cup qualifier against israel in cardiff .
football had been murphy 's passion since his childhood in ton pentre where he was selected to play for wales schoolboys team as a young teenager .
a scout spotted him and he joined west bromwich albion as a wing half , playing for them throughout the 1930s , including an fa cup final .
his first of 15 wales caps came in 1932 and welsh football historian ceri stennett said he was looked upon as " a key member of the team . "
the outbreak of world war ii led to murphy , whose father was irish , meeting matt busby , then a well-known scottish wing half .
post-war , busby became united manager , taking on murphy as assistant as he built them up from fairly ordinary side to legendary team .
two years before the munich disaster , murphy became wales manager .
on the day of the tragedy , after a tie against red star belgrade , he would normally have sat next to busby but was given leave of absence because it clashed with the wales match .
his son , jimmy jnr , recalls : " i was listening to the radio at home at four o 'clock when it came through about the manchester united air crash .
" my mother said ' oh dear god , your father ' but we quickly realised he was n't on that plane - he was with the welsh team in cardiff because he was manager of wales . "
murphy visited the survivors at munich 's rechts der isar hospital where busby implored him to take the reins .
among the patients was duncan edwards , one of murphy 's proteges , who at 21 had already won 18 england caps .
mr murphy jnr recalled : " the most common story about that -lsb- visit -rsb- is duncan edwards asking my father ' what time is kick-off jimmy ? ' and my father telling him to forget about it and for him to get himself fit and well " .
edwards would die from his injuries on 21 february . "
he loved the game passionately but he always figured he was a number two rather than a number one .. and suddenly he had to start making decisions himself " sir bobby charlton once home , murphy faced " leading manchester through the carnage and try and rebuild team to carry on with the season , " said mr stennett .
all this despite the intense grief he must have been feeling .
his son said : " my father would have them in the youth team and then the reserves and when they were ready , he 'd say to matt ' this player is ready ' , " " my father knew all these boys from the age of 15 and it must have been horrendous for him . "
mr stennett said : " jimmy murphy had been at the club so long , those players had come up through the ranks as youth players .
murphy was like a father figure to them .
" it was a little bit like jimmy murphy losing eight sons in one foul swoop . "
murphy himself recalled later : " amid all the tragedy and all the sorrow , i had to get a team together again .
i had to find players from somewhere . "
but he somehow found the strength to push on in the emergency to sign new players , bring in youngsters and others who had not travelled to belgrade .
all the while he had to attend the funerals of the players he had mentored .
in their first match , they beat sheffield wednesday 3-0 in an fa cup fifth round tie and went on to reach the final .
" they lost but it did not matter , " said mr stennett .
" it was a remarkable achievement . "
murphy continued as caretaker boss until busby was well enough to return .
he also managed wales until 1963 , reaching the 1958 world cup quarter-finals .
he also regularly returned to the rhondda , bringing manchester united youth players to play local sides .
munich survivor sir bobby charlton , in his recent autobiography and again yesterday , paid tribute to the role murphy had in his development as a young player - and the time when he took over .
" he loved the game passionately but he always figured he was a number two rather than a number one ... and suddenly he had to start making decisions himself , " said sir bobby .
" he did a marvellous job for a short period before matt busby came back - he loved the game . "
goalkeeper harry gregg , another survivor , added : " he would laugh with you , cry with you and fight with you - a wonderful man . "
the fact the extraordinary story of this rhondda boy , who died in 1989 , is not better known is perhaps explained by his modest character .

rhondda-born jimmy murphy , assistant to matt busby was called to the manager 's hospital bed in germany and urged to " keep the flag flying " .
eight players died after the crash on 6 february , 1958 , but the team would be back on the pitch just 13 days later .
murphy 's son jimmy jr said : " it must have been horrendous for him . "
his father would have been on the fateful flight returning from belgrade , but for his other role as wales manager .
murphy had stayed behind for a world cup qualifier against israel in cardiff .
football had been murphy 's passion since his childhood in ton pentre where he was selected to play for wales schoolboys team as a young teenager .
a scout spotted him and he joined west bromwich albion as a wing half , playing for them throughout the 1930s , including an fa cup final .
his first of 15 wales caps came in 1932 and welsh football historian ceri stennett said he was looked upon as " a key member of the team . "
the outbreak of world war ii led to murphy , whose father was irish , meeting matt busby , then a well-known scottish wing half .
a clock at old trafford is frozen at the time of the 1958 crash post-war , busby became united manager , taking on murphy as assistant as he built them up from fairly ordinary side to legendary team .
two years before the munich disaster , murphy became wales manager .
on the day of the tragedy , after a tie against red star belgrade , he would normally have sat next to busby but was given leave of absence because it clashed with the wales match .
his son , jimmy jnr , recalls : " i was listening to the radio at home at four o 'clock when it came through about the manchester united air crash .
" my mother said ' oh dear god , your father ' but we quickly realised he was n't on that plane - he was with the welsh team in cardiff because he was manager of wales . "
murphy visited the survivors at munich 's rechts der isar hospital where busby implored him to take the reins .
among the patients was duncan edwards , one of murphy 's proteges , who at 21 had already won 18 england caps .
mr murphy jnr recalled : " the most common story about that -lsb- visit -rsb- is duncan edwards asking my father ' what time is kick-off jimmy ? ' and my father telling him to forget about it and for him to get himself fit and well " .
edwards would die from his injuries on 21 february .
he loved the game passionately but he always figured he was a number two rather than a number one .. and suddenly he had to start making decisions himself sir bobby charlton once home , murphy faced " leading manchester through the carnage and try and rebuild team to carry on with the season , " said mr stennett .
all this despite the intense grief he must have been feeling .
his son said : " my father would have them in the youth team and then the reserves and when they were ready , he 'd say to matt ' this player is ready ' , " " my father knew all these boys from the age of 15 and it must have been horrendous for him . "
mr stennett said : " jimmy murphy had been at the club so long , those players had come up through the ranks as youth players .
murphy was like a father figure to them .
" it was a little bit like jimmy murphy losing eight sons in one foul swoop . "
murphy himself recalled later : " amid all the tragedy and all the sorrow , i had to get a team together again .
i had to find players from somewhere . "
but he somehow found the strength to push on in the emergency to sign new players , bring in youngsters and others who had not travelled to belgrade .
players , journalists and the chief coach were among the 23 who died all the while he had to attend the funerals of the players he had mentored .
in their first match , they beat sheffield wednesday 3-0 in an fa cup fifth round tie and went on to reach the final .
" they lost but it did not matter , " said mr stennett .
" it was a remarkable achievement . "
murphy continued as caretaker boss until busby was well enough to return .
he also managed wales until 1963 , reaching the 1958 world cup quarter-finals .
he also regularly returned to the rhondda , bringing manchester united youth players to play local sides .
munich survivor sir bobby charlton , in his recent autobiography and again yesterday , paid tribute to the role murphy had in his development as a young player - and the time when he took over .
" he loved the game passionately but he always figured he was a number two rather than a number one ... and suddenly he had to start making decisions himself , " said sir bobby .
" he did a marvellous job for a short period before matt busby came back - he loved the game . "
goalkeeper harry gregg , another survivor , added : " he would laugh with you , cry with you and fight with you - a wonderful man . "
the fact the extraordinary story of this rhondda boy , who died in 1989 , is not better known is perhaps explained by his modest character .
mr stennett said : " he himself would not have been looking to blow his own trumpet .
over the years matt busby achieved so much , i understand jimmy murphy was happy to be in a back seat . "
he added : " jimmy deserves to be remembered ... those people within the football who know their history do know about jimmy murphy . "

the ty mawr development on land between llanfairpwll and menai bridge would potentially offer 1,300 jobs in shops , restaurants , and a multiplex cinema .
objectors claim the plans would have a detrimental effect on the environment and will not benefit the island .
developers deny this and say the park will complement its surroundings and bring economic benefits to the area .
the development will cover 55 acres , some 600 metres from the britannia bridge , just off the junction with the a5025 .
a spokesman for developers ynys mon estates llp said the park had been designed to complement its natural surroundings .
there is no need for it on anglesey gwynne owen , resident " the development has been designed to fit in with its existing locality , which includes giving all cultural factors , especially the importance of the welsh language , their rightful status , " said a spokeswoman .
job opportunities would also stem depopulation from the island , she added .
there were also plans to set aside part of the site close to the bluebell wood and burial chamber as an interpretive centre .
the public displays would provide an opportunity for the company to " explain more about the development and receive feedback directly from the community " , she added .
gwynne owen , a local member of the campaign for the protection of rural wales -lrb- cprw -rrb- said he had been through the plans carefully .
" we are particularly worried about the effects on traffic , possible queues of cars trying to access the site and a lack of public transport .
" it is above an area great beauty and is not a sustainable development .
there is no need for it on anglesey , " mr owen added .
public exhibitions will be held at the memorial hall , llanfairpwll , on 7 february and menai bridge community centre on 11 february between 1030 and 2000 gmt .

mr khodorkovsky , once russia 's richest man , said the lack of the rule of law was his country 's biggest problem .
the ex-boss of russia 's disbanded oil firm yukos was speaking to the financial times , in what was his first face-to-face interview in five years .
mr khodorkovsky was sentenced in 2005 to eight years in jail for tax evasion .
his supporters say the charges were politically motivated because he funded russian opposition groups .
we 're a european country .
that 's how we developed .
and the way forward for us is the european way mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky , 44 , is currently on hunger strike in support of another yukos executive , vasily aleksanyan , who is being tried on embezzlement charges .
mr aleksanyan has aids and cancer - and on thursday the authorities said he would be allowed out of prison for specialist hospital treatment .
optimism mr khodorkovsky was speaking in a courtroom in the eastern siberian city of chita , where he is being held to face new embezzlement charges .
he accused president vladimir putin of using the law to target political enemies , especially business owners like himself .
he expressed doubts that dmitry medvedev , mr putin 's chosen successor , would be able to reverse the trend .
" it will be so difficult for him .
i ca n't even imagine ...
" tradition , and the state of people 's minds , and the lack of forces able to -lsb- support -rsb- any movement towards the rule of law , everything 's against him .
so ... may god grant him the strength to do it .
all we can do is hope , " mr khodorkovsky said .
he identified russia 's biggest problem as the lack of the rule of law , saying it was worse than in china .
" laws can be better and they can be worse .
but people must abide by laws , and not use them for their own ends , " he said .
however , he said he was generally optimistic about russia 's future , adding that it was " not possible " for his country to return to the darkest days of its soviet past .
" i 'm convinced that russia is a european country , it 's a country with democratic traditions which more than once have been broken off during its history , but nonetheless there are traditions . "
yukos saga yukos , once russia 's biggest oil company , was declared bankrupt in 2006 and ceased to exist as a legal entity in november 2007 .
the company had been steadily dismantled after being accused of massive fraud and tax evasion by the russian authorities .
yukos maintained it was the victim of a concerted political campaign by a government which wanted to discredit its executives and gain control of vital energy assets .
russian officials deny the allegation .

mr khodorkovsky , once russia 's richest man , said the lack of the rule of law was his country 's biggest problem .
the ex-boss of russia 's disbanded oil firm yukos was speaking to the financial times , in what was his first face-to-face interview in five years .
mr khodorkovsky was sentenced in 2005 to eight years in jail for tax evasion .
his supporters say the charges were politically motivated because he funded russian opposition groups . "
we 're a european country .
that 's how we developed .
and the way forward for us is the european way " mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky , 44 , is currently on hunger strike in support of another yukos executive , vasily aleksanyan , who is being tried on embezzlement charges .
mr aleksanyan has aids and cancer - and on thursday the authorities said he would be allowed out of prison for specialist hospital treatment .
optimism mr khodorkovsky was speaking in a courtroom in the eastern siberian city of chita , where he is being held to face new embezzlement charges .
he accused president vladimir putin of using the law to target political enemies , especially business owners like himself .
he expressed doubts that dmitry medvedev , mr putin 's chosen successor , would be able to reverse the trend .
" it will be so difficult for him .
i ca n't even imagine ...
" tradition , and the state of people 's minds , and the lack of forces able to -lsb- support -rsb- any movement towards the rule of law , everything 's against him .
so ... may god grant him the strength to do it .
all we can do is hope , " mr khodorkovsky said .
he identified russia 's biggest problem as the lack of the rule of law , saying it was worse than in china .
" laws can be better and they can be worse .
but people must abide by laws , and not use them for their own ends , " he said .
however , he said he was generally optimistic about russia 's future , adding that it was " not possible " for his country to return to the darkest days of its soviet past .
" i 'm convinced that russia is a european country , it 's a country with democratic traditions which more than once have been broken off during its history , but nonetheless there are traditions . "
yukos saga yukos , once russia 's biggest oil company , was declared bankrupt in 2006 and ceased to exist as a legal entity in november 2007 .
the company had been steadily dismantled after being accused of massive fraud and tax evasion by the russian authorities .
yukos maintained it was the victim of a concerted political campaign by a government which wanted to discredit its executives and gain control of vital energy assets .
russian officials deny the allegation .

the 656ft -lrb- 200m -rrb- thick , 1,255 sq mile -lrb- 3,250 sq km -rrb- larsen b shelf broke apart in march 2002 .
but neil glasser of aberystwyth university and ted scambos of colorado university claim in a new study that it had been on the brink for decades .
they argue that glaciological and atmospheric factors were also invoved .
in a paper published in the journal of glaciology , the pair say that when larsen b collapsed it appeared to be the latest in a long line of victims of antarctic summer heatwaves linked to global warming .
researchers from the british antarctic survey predicted in 1998 that several ice shelves around the peninsula were doomed because of rising temperatures in the region , but the speed with which larsen b went shocked them in 2002 . "
a number of other atmospheric , oceanic and glaciological factors are involved " professor neil glasser , aberystwyth university but prof glasser said the dramatic event was " not as simple as we first thought " .
he acknowledged that global warming had a major part to play in the collapse , but emphasised that it was only one of a number of contributory factors .
" because large amounts of meltwater appeared on the ice shelf just before it collapsed , we had always assumed that air temperature increases were to blame , " he added .
" but our new study shows that ice-shelf break up is not controlled simply by climate .
" a number of other atmospheric , oceanic and glaciological factors are involved .
" for example , the location and spacing of fractures on the ice shelf such as crevasses and rifts are very important too because they determine how strong or weak the ice shelf is . "
dr scambos , of the university of colorado 's national snow and ice data centre , said the ice shelf had probably been in distress for decades before its demise .
" it 's likely that melting from higher ocean temperatures , or even a gradual decline in the ice mass of the peninsula over the centuries , was pushing the larsen to the brink , " he added .

the 656ft -lrb- 200m -rrb- thick , 1,255 sq mile -lrb- 3,250 sq km -rrb- larsen b shelf broke apart in march 2002 .
but neil glasser of aberystwyth university and ted scambos of colorado university claim in a new study that it had been on the brink for decades .
they argue that glaciological and atmospheric factors were also invoved .
in a paper published in the journal of glaciology , the pair say that when larsen b collapsed it appeared to be the latest in a long line of victims of antarctic summer heatwaves linked to global warming .
researchers from the british antarctic survey predicted in 1998 that several ice shelves around the peninsula were doomed because of rising temperatures in the region , but the speed with which larsen b went shocked them in 2002 .
a number of other atmospheric , oceanic and glaciological factors are involved professor neil glasser , aberystwyth university but prof glasser said the dramatic event was " not as simple as we first thought " .
he acknowledged that global warming had a major part to play in the collapse , but emphasised that it was only one of a number of contributory factors .
" because large amounts of meltwater appeared on the ice shelf just before it collapsed , we had always assumed that air temperature increases were to blame , " he added .
" but our new study shows that ice-shelf break up is not controlled simply by climate .

the ban has been strictly enforced on campus since 1997 when the staunchly secularist military ousted a government seen as too islamist .
wednesday 's vote was carried by 401 in favour to 110 against .
final approval is expected in a vote on saturday .
the islamist-rooted ak party has a safe majority in the turkish parliament .
court threat as turkey 's population is predominantly muslim , two-thirds of all turkish women cover their heads , meaning thousands miss out on the opportunity to attend college .
many turks argue that is unfair .
the government wants to allow traditional scarves tied under the chin , although more enveloping versions would still be banned .
in wednesday 's heated debate , bekir bozdag , deputy chairman of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , said the amendment bill would strengthen turkey 's characteristic principle of secularism .
" giving an equal right to education to every citizen is not against the state of law and democracy , " he said .
" is n't secularism the guarantee for everyone who wants to benefit from the equal right to education ? "
but hakki suha okay , a member of the strictly secular main opposition republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- , said the package " aims to render the principle of secularism ineffective " .
" this step will encourage radical -lsb- islamic -rsb- circles in turkey , accelerate movement towards a state founded on religion , lead to further demands " against the spirit of the republic , he said .
the government 's plan to change the law has sparked large protest rallies by secular turks , who want to defend the legacy of the modern state 's founder mustafa kemal ataturk .
they fear it may be a first step to eroding the secular system .
with the backing of a nationalist opposition party , the government has enough votes to change the constitution and relax the ban .
but if it does , the chp has vowed to challenge the amendment in the constitutional court .
the problem , says the bbc 's sarah rainsford in istanbul , is that the leaders of the current government once espoused political islam and turkey 's powerful secular establishment does not trust them .
they fear that lifting the headscarf ban is just the first of many steps to bring islam into public life , slowly changing the face of modern turkey and putting pressure on those who do not cover up to do so , our correspondent says .

triptych 1974-77 , painted in response to the suicide of bacon 's lover george dyer in 1971 , made £ 26,340,500 at christie 's in london .

the dublin-born figurative painter died in 1992 .

jamie and lynne spears said they were " extremely disappointed " that their daughter had been released against the recommendation of her psychiatrist .
spears , accompanied by private security guards , slipped out of the ucla medical center a week earlier than expected .
she had been undergoing psychiatric evaluation since 31 january .
we are deeply concerned about our daughter 's safety and vulnerability jamie and lynne spears after her release , spears spent the day driving around los angeles with an unidentified man , accompanied by paparazzi who surrounded the vehicle at each stop .
in a joint statement , her parents said : " we are deeply concerned about our daughter 's safety and vulnerability and we believe her life is presently at risk .
" we ask only that the court 's orders be enforced so that a tragedy may be averted . "
the star 's low-key departure from the ucla medical center , in stark contrast to her admission , required no police escort , the commander of the north hollywood police station said .
" there was no media , no paparazzi , and no need for public safety protection , " capt sharyn buck told the associated press .
more than a dozen lapd officers escorted spears to the facility in a motorcade on 31 january , when she was admitted to hospital and held for a 72-hour evaluation .
restraining order her stay was then extended for a further two weeks , according to reports .
this week , spears 's manager was banned from going near her after a court issued a restraining order .
lynne spears told a judge that sam lutfi drugged her daughter , cut off her phone lines and called her an " unfit mother " in an attempt to take control of her life .
the 26-year-old singer was briefly hospitalised earlier in january after refusing to surrender custody of her two sons in a police stand-off .
sole custody of the children was subsequently awarded to her former-husband , kevin federline .
spears remains under the temporary conservatorship of her father until 14 february , an arrangement put in place when a judge determines a person can no longer care for themselves .
jamie spears has been named her conservator , and he and lawyer andrew wallet were made co-conservators of the estate .

many chose to start the celebrations with a visit to a buddhist temple , like these people in the malaysian capital , kuala lumpur .
despite the cold weather , thousands of people gathered at temples in beijing to mark the most important annual festival in much of east asia .
in indonesia , where the celebration was banned for years by recently deceased leader suharto , ethnic chinese people burned incense and offered prayers .
every year millions of people travel home to be with their families for the holiday .
in parts of china , families make dumplings to symbolise luck and reunion .
but not everyone can be with their loved ones , like this man in south korea who offered prayers for his parents across the border in the north .
new year fairs spring up in chinese cities , selling toys , gifts and red decorations said to bring good luck .
firecrackers , traditionally believed to scare away evil spirits , are set off in cities , towns and villages across the region .
workers at the philippine stock exchange were treated to a traditional chinese dragon dance .
the year of the rat is said to be a good year for business and commerce .
celebrations will continue over the weekend .
thousands of people are expected to watch parades and performances in london 's chinatown .

well , maybe not all of them , but most mps agreed on wednesday that the introduction of the single market had been " a good thing " .
one or two suggested that it was about the only good thing to come out of the european union in the past fifty years .
this lack of controversy and passion meant the business secretary , john hutton , could use a fair proportion of his speech at the start of day four to have a pop at the conservatives .
the normally mild-mannered mr hutton , who is currently sporting a pair of euro-intellectual spectacles , was taken to task by the deputy speaker , sir alan haselhurt when he referred to the tory benches as " that lot " and " these characters " .
mr hutton told the commons nearly 60 % of uk trade was now with other member states and around three million jobs were linked to the export of goods and services to the eu .
downgrading concern he said uk business leaders had agreed that the lisbon treaty would deliver a more effective european union .
conservative mps were angry that a commitment to free and undistorted competition was removed from the objectives of the european union and in their view " relegated " to a protocol .
the blame for this apparent downgrading of competition has been put firmly at the feet of the french president nicholas sarkozy .
last june , he persuaded his fellow eu leaders to drop the principle of " free and undistorted competition " from article 3 of the old constitutional treaty .
instead the commitment was put in a protocol .
' dogma ' recently the world 's media has focused on president sarkozy 's movie star life style and , of course , his wedding to the former model carla bruni .
last summer , in public at least , he was more interested in models of the economic kind when he asked : " as an ideology , as a dogma , what has competition given europe ? "
" it is unhelpful in the extreme that first of all we have this emergence of economic nationalism , not just in france , and that the british government has made a concession " vince cable lib dem treasury spokesman in the commons , the tories argued that the british government should have used its veto to stop this happening .
john hutton insisted that the protocol had the same legal effect as any part of the treaty and said there was " no basis in fact or law " for the claim that putting the commitment in a protocol relegated competition to the sidelines .
the business secretary said the treaty did not make any major changes to the legal basis of the single market but introduced a number of technical measures which he said could benefit uk workers , consumers and businesses .
" i fundamentally believe that this treaty can help us build a europe ready for the 21st century , focused on the issues that matter such as jobs , growth and open and competitive markets , " said mr hutton .
' damaging concession ' for the conservatives , philip hammond accused ministers of a sell out " of truly historical significance " and said the british government had rolled over during the negotiations .
" quite deliberately , this treaty - with the connivance of the british government - downgrades the objective of open and competitive single market from its place at the heart of the eu 's agenda to an obscure protocol tacked on to the back of the treaty , " mr hammond told mps .
liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable suggested this was the one issue of controversy in this section of the treaty .
mr cable said : " it is unhelpful in the extreme that first of all we have this emergence of economic nationalism , not just in france , and that the british government has made a concession .
" it may be a symbolic concession but it is of a rather damaging kind . "
a conservative amendment " deploring " what it called the government 's " failure " to block the relegation of competition to a protocol was defeated by 352 votes to 176 , a government majority 176 .
the government 's motion approving its policy towards this section of lisbon treaty , was then approved by a majority of 159 .

john hutton is ' sporting a pair of euro-intellectual spectacles ' well , maybe not all of them , but most mps agreed on wednesday that the introduction of the single market had been " a good thing " .
one or two suggested that it was about the only good thing to come out of the european union in the past fifty years .
this lack of controversy and passion meant the business secretary , john hutton , could use a fair proportion of his speech at the start of day four to have a pop at the conservatives .
the normally mild-mannered mr hutton , who is currently sporting a pair of euro-intellectual spectacles , was taken to task by the deputy speaker , sir alan haselhurt when he referred to the tory benches as " that lot " and " these characters " .
mr hutton told the commons nearly 60 % of uk trade was now with other member states and around three million jobs were linked to the export of goods and services to the eu .
downgrading concern he said uk business leaders had agreed that the lisbon treaty would deliver a more effective european union .
conservative mps were angry that a commitment to free and undistorted competition was removed from the objectives of the european union and in their view " relegated " to a protocol .
the blame for this apparent downgrading of competition has been put firmly at the feet of the french president nicholas sarkozy .
mr sarkozy is blamed by the tories for downgrading the free market last june , he persuaded his fellow eu leaders to drop the principle of " free and undistorted competition " from article 3 of the old constitutional treaty .
instead the commitment was put in a protocol .
' dogma ' recently the world 's media has focused on president sarkozy 's movie star life style and , of course , his wedding to the former model carla bruni .
last summer , in public at least , he was more interested in models of the economic kind when he asked : " as an ideology , as a dogma , what has competition given europe ? "
it is unhelpful in the extreme that first of all we have this emergence of economic nationalism , not just in france , and that the british government has made a concession vince cable lib dem treasury spokesman in the commons , the tories argued that the british government should have used its veto to stop this happening .
john hutton insisted that the protocol had the same legal effect as any part of the treaty and said there was " no basis in fact or law " for the claim that putting the commitment in a protocol relegated competition to the sidelines .
the business secretary said the treaty did not make any major changes to the legal basis of the single market but introduced a number of technical measures which he said could benefit uk workers , consumers and businesses .
" i fundamentally believe that this treaty can help us build a europe ready for the 21st century , focused on the issues that matter such as jobs , growth and open and competitive markets , " said mr hutton .
' damaging concession ' for the conservatives , philip hammond accused ministers of a sell out " of truly historical significance " and said the british government had rolled over during the negotiations .
" quite deliberately , this treaty - with the connivance of the british government - downgrades the objective of open and competitive single market from its place at the heart of the eu 's agenda to an obscure protocol tacked on to the back of the treaty , " mr hammond told mps .
liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable suggested this was the one issue of controversy in this section of the treaty .
mr cable said : " it is unhelpful in the extreme that first of all we have this emergence of economic nationalism , not just in france , and that the british government has made a concession .
" it may be a symbolic concession but it is of a rather damaging kind . "
a conservative amendment " deploring " what it called the government 's " failure " to block the relegation of competition to a protocol was defeated by 352 votes to 176 , a government majority 176 .
the government 's motion approving its policy towards this section of lisbon treaty , was then approved by a majority of 159 .

john hutton is ' sporting a pair of euro-intellectual spectacles ' well , maybe not all of them , but most mps agreed on wednesday that the introduction of the single market had been " a good thing " .
one or two suggested that it was about the only good thing to come out of the european union in the past fifty years .
this lack of controversy and passion meant the business secretary , john hutton , could use a fair proportion of his speech at the start of day four to have a pop at the conservatives .
the normally mild-mannered mr hutton , who is currently sporting a pair of euro-intellectual spectacles , was taken to task by the deputy speaker , sir alan haselhurt when he referred to the tory benches as " that lot " and " these characters " .
mr hutton told the commons nearly 60 % of uk trade was now with other member states and around three million jobs were linked to the export of goods and services to the eu .
downgrading concern he said uk business leaders had agreed that the lisbon treaty would deliver a more effective european union .
conservative mps were angry that a commitment to free and undistorted competition was removed from the objectives of the european union and in their view " relegated " to a protocol .
the blame for this apparent downgrading of competition has been put firmly at the feet of the french president nicholas sarkozy .
mr sarkozy is blamed by the tories for downgrading the free market last june , he persuaded his fellow eu leaders to drop the principle of " free and undistorted competition " from article 3 of the old constitutional treaty .
instead the commitment was put in a protocol .
' dogma ' recently the world 's media has focused on president sarkozy 's movie star life style and , of course , his wedding to the former model carla bruni .
last summer , in public at least , he was more interested in models of the economic kind when he asked : " as an ideology , as a dogma , what has competition given europe ? "
it is unhelpful in the extreme that first of all we have this emergence of economic nationalism , not just in france , and that the british government has made a concession vince cable lib dem treasury spokesman in the commons , the tories argued that the british government should have used its veto to stop this happening .
john hutton insisted that the protocol had the same legal effect as any part of the treaty and said there was " no basis in fact or law " for the claim that putting the commitment in a protocol relegated competition to the sidelines .
the business secretary said the treaty did not make any major changes to the legal basis of the single market but introduced a number of technical measures which he said could benefit uk workers , consumers and businesses .
" i fundamentally believe that this treaty can help us build a europe ready for the 21st century , focused on the issues that matter such as jobs , growth and open and competitive markets , " said mr hutton .
' damaging concession ' for the conservatives , philip hammond accused ministers of a sell out " of truly historical significance " and said the british government had rolled over during the negotiations .
" quite deliberately , this treaty - with the connivance of the british government - downgrades the objective of open and competitive single market from its place at the heart of the eu 's agenda to an obscure protocol tacked on to the back of the treaty , " mr hammond told mps .
liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable suggested this was the one issue of controversy in this section of the treaty .
mr cable said : " it is unhelpful in the extreme that first of all we have this emergence of economic nationalism , not just in france , and that the british government has made a concession .
" it may be a symbolic concession but it is of a rather damaging kind . "
a conservative amendment " deploring " what it called the government 's " failure " to block the relegation of competition to a protocol was defeated by 352 votes to 176 , a government majority 176 .
the government 's motion approving its policy towards this section of lisbon treaty , was then approved by a majority of 159 .

mr bernanke said that the insurers ' problems could have an adverse effect on financial markets and the economy .
bond insurers are reeling after the value of the us mortgage-backed investments they had guaranteed fell .
analysts fear the insurers will not be able to pay out , forcing banks to announce another big round of losses .
ratings fears bond insurers , also known as monolines , make money by insuring against loans going wrong .
if the issuer of a bond goes bust , they guarantee to step in and make interest rate payments and repay the principal .
this makes borrowing cheaper for financial institutions and companies .
mbia , the largest us bond insurer , said on wednesday it would raise $ 750m -lrb- £ 384m -rrb- by issuing new shares , after it made a net loss of $ 2.3bn in the three months ending 31 december .
the capital should help it retain its top credit ratings crucial for its business .
however , rating agency fitch said mbia 's main bond insurance unit could lose its top triple-a rating even with new capital , because it faces big potential losses after guaranteeing repackaged sub-prime debt .
' adverse effects ' if their credit ratings are cut , it could make it harder or more expensive for bond insurers to raise the money to pay banks and other institutions .
" given the adverse effects that problems of financial guarantors can have on financial markets and the economy , we are closely monitoring developments , " federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said in a letter .
the 4 february letter was to paul kanjorksi , the chairman of the house of representatives subcommittee that overseas capital markets .
he will hold a hearing on the need for reform to the sector on 14 february .

mr bernanke said that the insurers ' problems could have an adverse effect on financial markets and the economy .
bond insurers are reeling after the value of the us mortgage-backed investments they had guaranteed fell .
analysts fear the insurers will not be able to pay out , forcing banks to announce another big round of losses .
ratings fears bond insurers , also known as monolines , make money by insuring against loans going wrong .
if the issuer of a bond goes bust , they guarantee to step in and make interest rate payments and repay the principal .
this makes borrowing cheaper for financial institutions and companies .
mbia , the largest us bond insurer , said on wednesday it would raise $ 750m -lrb- £ 384m -rrb- by issuing new shares , after it made a net loss of $ 2.3bn in the three months ending 31 december .
the capital should help it retain its top credit ratings crucial for its business .
however , rating agency fitch said mbia 's main bond insurance unit could lose its top triple-a rating even with new capital , because it faces big potential losses after guaranteeing repackaged sub-prime debt .
' adverse effects ' if their credit ratings are cut , it could make it harder or more expensive for bond insurers to raise the money to pay banks and other institutions .
" given the adverse effects that problems of financial guarantors can have on financial markets and the economy , we are closely monitoring developments , " federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said in a letter .
the 4 february letter was to paul kanjorksi , the chairman of the house of representatives subcommittee that overseas capital markets .
he will hold a hearing on the need for reform to the sector on 14 february .

thanks , madonna . "
perhaps this was n't the actual wording of the postcard the queen of pop sent to berlin film festival director dieter kosslick , but the request was the same .
accordingly , madonna 's directorial film debut , filth and wisdom , will have its premiere at the festival .
kosslick has been telling reporters he was " really impressed " by the pop star 's forthright request .
" i 've never before received a card from someone who said : ' dear dieter , if you like my film , i 'd love it to be screened in berlin ' , " he said .
he replied in the affirmative at once , perhaps thinking of the publicity rather than her previous film outings - such as the critically-derided swept away , which she made with film-maker husband guy ritchie .
but in filth and wisdom the music star says behind the camera .
while critics are sharpening their pencils , the buzz about her 81-minute film has so far been favourable .
musical themes starring richard e grant and set in london , it is described as a comedy based on some of the material girl 's own experiences in showbusiness .
cinema buffs may have been forgiven for wondering if this really is a film festival on hearing that the rolling stones would open the event .
but they are attending as the subject of a documentary by oscar-winner martin scorsese .
shine a light includes archive footage as well as new material from a stones gig in 2006 , held to celebrate bill clinton 's 60th birthday .
musical themes have been a feature of dieter kosslick 's six years in charge at berlin .
the german capital is geared up for the 58th berlinale last year the festival opened with la vie en rose , a biopic of edith piaf which has gained leading lady marion cotillard an oscar nomination .
and the musicians will keep arriving in berlin in 2008 - with a documentary about punk star patti smith , and neil young flying in to promote csny - deja vu .
while this sounds like the title of a police series , it is actually the story of folk-rock supergroup crosby , stills , nash and young reuniting in 2006 .
the group , now in their 60s , travelled the usa to protest the war in iraq , and viewers see angry audiences in atlanta walking out as they sing let 's impeach the president for lying .
the documentary is now standard operating procedure at any festival - and , appropriately enough , that is the title of one highly-anticipated feature which investigates the events at abu ghraib prison in iraq .
paparazzi shots but if you 're looking for a brad , george or julia to appear at this year 's berlinale you will be disappointed - even though julia roberts has a film showing .
it is not until the end of the festival - when scarlett johansson and natalie portman arrive for the sumptuous adaptation of philippa gregory 's novel , the other boleyn girl - that the paparazzi will have their shots .
" there are a lot of films not ready this year for some reason , " explains barbara thuillier , film correspondent for german tv network rtl .
" it 's very unusual - most of them will have to go to cannes instead . "
hollywood star scarlett johansson will promote the other boleyn girl it may occur to journalists , as they shiver on the red carpet in the february cold , that the french riviera in may sounds like a better option .
berlin is no longer a big staging post on the road to the oscars , now that the academy awards are held only a few days later .
there is only one potential oscar winner here - daniel day-lewis for there will be blood - who is doing little publicity .
ms thuillier points out that the berlin festival is still the third biggest film marketplace in the world .
" why i really love it , is that it 's always so fascinating and quirky .
they 're always trying new ideas out here , with a forum just for new digital technology and events exploring the connection between film and food . "
and just like sundance in the us , berlin is the place to launch european indie movies .
director mike leigh will be showing happy go lucky , his first film since vera drake , while tilda swinton 's performance as an alcoholic in julia is guaranteed to please the critics .
audiences will also expect a stir around british-directed film gardens of the night , which depicts two children who are abducted and abused for years .
the berlin film festival runs from the 7-17 february .

shine a light includes archive footage as well as new material from a stones gig in 2006 , held to celebrate bill clinton 's 60th birthday .
musical themes have been a feature of dieter kosslick 's six years in charge at berlin .
the german capital is geared up for the 58th berlinale last year the festival opened with la vie en rose , a biopic of edith piaf which has gained leading lady marion cotillard an oscar nomination .
and the musicians will keep arriving in berlin in 2008 - with a documentary about punk star patti smith , and neil young flying in to promote csny - deja vu .
while this sounds like the title of a police series , it is actually the story of folk-rock supergroup crosby , stills , nash and young reuniting in 2006 .
the group , now in their 60s , travelled the usa to protest the war in iraq , and viewers see angry audiences in atlanta walking out as they sing let 's impeach the president for lying .
the documentary is now standard operating procedure at any festival - and , appropriately enough , that is the title of one highly-anticipated feature which investigates the events at abu ghraib prison in iraq .
paparazzi shots but if you 're looking for a brad , george or julia to appear at this year 's berlinale you will be disappointed - even though julia roberts has a film showing .
it is not until the end of the festival - when scarlett johansson and natalie portman arrive for the sumptuous adaptation of philippa gregory 's novel , the other boleyn girl - that the paparazzi will have their shots .
" there are a lot of films not ready this year for some reason , " explains barbara thuillier , film correspondent for german tv network rtl .
" it 's very unusual - most of them will have to go to cannes instead . "
hollywood star scarlett johansson will promote the other boleyn girl it may occur to journalists , as they shiver on the red carpet in the february cold , that the french riviera in may sounds like a better option .
berlin is no longer a big staging post on the road to the oscars , now that the academy awards are held only a few days later .
there is only one potential oscar winner here - daniel day-lewis for there will be blood - who is doing little publicity .
ms thuillier points out that the berlin festival is still the third biggest film marketplace in the world .
" why i really love it , is that it 's always so fascinating and quirky .
they 're always trying new ideas out here , with a forum just for new digital technology and events exploring the connection between film and food . "
and just like sundance in the us , berlin is the place to launch european indie movies .
director mike leigh will be showing happy go lucky , his first film since vera drake , while tilda swinton 's performance as an alcoholic in julia is guaranteed to please the critics .
audiences will also expect a stir around british-directed film gardens of the night , which depicts two children who are abducted and abused for years .
the berlin film festival runs from the 7-17 february .

" i 've never before received a card from someone who said : ' dear dieter , if you like my film , i 'd love it to be screened in berlin ' , " he said .
he replied in the affirmative at once , perhaps thinking of the publicity rather than her previous film outings - such as the critically-derided swept away , which she made with film-maker husband guy ritchie .
