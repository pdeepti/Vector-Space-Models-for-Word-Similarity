program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2008 media : germany stimulus package smaller than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stimulus package might not have as much for infrastructure projects as once thought german papers reported on wednesday , dec .
24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .
5 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2008 media : germany stimulus package smaller than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stimulus package might not have as much for infrastructure projects as once thought german papers reported on wednesday , dec .
24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .
5 .
projects are likely to include such things as road construction , broadband internet access and schools . some politicians have called for tax cuts to spur consumer spending , but merkel has said reductions are off the table until september elections . some economists have warned that germany could be facing its worst economic downturn since world war two .

and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .

some german politicians have warned that germany 's offer to accept inmates should not be unconditional .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .

24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .

projects are likely to include such things as road construction , broadband internet access and schools . some politicians have called for tax cuts to spur consumer spending , but merkel has said reductions are off the table until september elections . some economists have warned that germany could be facing its worst economic downturn since world war two .

and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .
" the time has come for the european union to step forward , " he wrote .
" as a matter of principle and coherence , we should send a clear signal of our willingness to help the us government in that regard , namely through the resettlement of detainees .
as far as the portuguese government is concerned , we will be available to participate . "
german offer not unconditional the german foreign ministry has indicated that the issue of taking in guantanamo inmates will be discussed with the us in january when the czech republic takes over the eu 's presidency .
around 250 prisoners , including the alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , are currently being held at guantanamo bay .
charges have still not been brought against dozens of detainees who have spent years at the controversial facility .
some german politicians have warned that germany 's offer to accept inmates should not be unconditional .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .
but , he said , the danger that prisoners pose " should not be played down . "
china wants uighurs back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights group say the uighurs are politically persecuted in china germany is particularly interested in a group of 17 uighurs . a muslim minority from central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups . germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich . china however remains opposed to talk of european nations taking in the uighurs . the government there wants to see the 17 muslim chinese terror suspects returned to china if guantanamo is closed . " the 17 terror suspects imprisoned in the us military base of guantanamo bay are members of the east turkestan islamic movement , which has been listed as a terrorist organization by the united nations , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said this week .

and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .

wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .
but , he said , the danger that prisoners pose " should not be played down . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 24.12.2008 more eu states willing to accept freed guantanamo inmates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates at guantanamo bay have been in legal limbo for years a growing number of european union countries are reportedly interested in helping us president-elect obama meet his promises to close guantanamo bay by taking in inmates from the controversial detention camp . throughout his campaign , us president-elect barack obama promised to shutter the controversial military prison at guantanamo bay , cuba .
and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .
" the time has come for the european union to step forward , " he wrote .

german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .

and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .
" the time has come for the european union to step forward , " he wrote .
" as a matter of principle and coherence , we should send a clear signal of our willingness to help the us government in that regard , namely through the resettlement of detainees .
as far as the portuguese government is concerned , we will be available to participate . "
german offer not unconditional the german foreign ministry has indicated that the issue of taking in guantanamo inmates will be discussed with the us in january when the czech republic takes over the eu 's presidency .
around 250 prisoners , including the alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , are currently being held at guantanamo bay .
charges have still not been brought against dozens of detainees who have spent years at the controversial facility .
some german politicians have warned that germany 's offer to accept inmates should not be unconditional .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .
but , he said , the danger that prisoners pose " should not be played down . "
china wants uighurs back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights group say the uighurs are politically persecuted in china germany is particularly interested in a group of 17 uighurs . a muslim minority from central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups . germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich . china however remains opposed to talk of european nations taking in the uighurs . the government there wants to see the 17 muslim chinese terror suspects returned to china if guantanamo is closed . " the 17 terror suspects imprisoned in the us military base of guantanamo bay are members of the east turkestan islamic movement , which has been listed as a terrorist organization by the united nations , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said this week . " for these terror suspects , the chinese government has always requested they be sent back to china and firmly opposes any country accepting them , " he told a news briefing . though the ethnic uighurs have been cleared of the label “ enemy combatant ” by the bush administration , they have not been allowed to leave guantanamo .
the u.s. government has said it can not return the uighurs to china because they would face persecution there and in 2006 , the united states allowed five chinese muslims to be released to albania . state department spokesman sean mccormack said the bush administration understood china 's point of view but needed to " assure ourselves that if people are transferred out of guantanamo under whatever status that they are not going to be mistreated in any way , shape or form . ” " at this point we do n't believe that it would be the right thing to do to transfer these individuals back to china , " he told reporters in washington . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .
5 .
projects are likely to include such things as road construction , broadband internet access and schools . some politicians have called for tax cuts to spur consumer spending , but merkel has said reductions are off the table until september elections . some economists have warned that germany could be facing its worst economic downturn since world war two .

that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .
" the time has come for the european union to step forward , " he wrote .
" as a matter of principle and coherence , we should send a clear signal of our willingness to help the us government in that regard , namely through the resettlement of detainees .
as far as the portuguese government is concerned , we will be available to participate . "
german offer not unconditional the german foreign ministry has indicated that the issue of taking in guantanamo inmates will be discussed with the us in january when the czech republic takes over the eu 's presidency .
around 250 prisoners , including the alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , are currently being held at guantanamo bay .
charges have still not been brought against dozens of detainees who have spent years at the controversial facility .
some german politicians have warned that germany 's offer to accept inmates should not be unconditional .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .
but , he said , the danger that prisoners pose " should not be played down . "
china wants uighurs back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights group say the uighurs are politically persecuted in china germany is particularly interested in a group of 17 uighurs . a muslim minority from central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups . germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich . china however remains opposed to talk of european nations taking in the uighurs . the government there wants to see the 17 muslim chinese terror suspects returned to china if guantanamo is closed . " the 17 terror suspects imprisoned in the us military base of guantanamo bay are members of the east turkestan islamic movement , which has been listed as a terrorist organization by the united nations , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said this week . " for these terror suspects , the chinese government has always requested they be sent back to china and firmly opposes any country accepting them , " he told a news briefing . though the ethnic uighurs have been cleared of the label “ enemy combatant ” by the bush administration , they have not been allowed to leave guantanamo .
the u.s. government has said it can not return the uighurs to china because they would face persecution there and in 2006 , the united states allowed five chinese muslims to be released to albania . state department spokesman sean mccormack said the bush administration understood china 's point of view but needed to " assure ourselves that if people are transferred out of guantanamo under whatever status that they are not going to be mistreated in any way , shape or form . ” " at this point we do n't believe that it would be the right thing to do to transfer these individuals back to china , " he told reporters in washington . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was lucky to get out in one piece . " the man said he wanted to keep -lrb- knut -rrb- company , " berlin police spokeswoman miriam tauchmann told reuters .
" he was very lucky that nothing serious happened with such an act of foolishness . " quick-thinking zookeepers threw knut a leg of beef to distract the bear after the man , 37 , waded through a moat and climbed into knut 's enclosure at berlin 's zoo .
polar bears are among the fiercest animals in the world . knut , 2 , who as a harmless little cub used to wrestle with his keeper , is now 220 kg -lrb- 400 lb -rrb- and a predator .
but this time he simply looked at the visitor impassively , then ate the beef . the invader ignored zookeepers ' orders to leave and only left when police arrived 20 minutes later and pulled him from the pen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2008 media : germany stimulus package smaller than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stimulus package might not have as much for infrastructure projects as once thought german papers reported on wednesday , dec .
24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .
5 .
projects are likely to include such things as road construction , broadband internet access and schools . some politicians have called for tax cuts to spur consumer spending , but merkel has said reductions are off the table until september elections . some economists have warned that germany could be facing its worst economic downturn since world war two .

24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .
5 .
projects are likely to include such things as road construction , broadband internet access and schools . some politicians have called for tax cuts to spur consumer spending , but merkel has said reductions are off the table until september elections . some economists have warned that germany could be facing its worst economic downturn since world war two .

and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .
" the time has come for the european union to step forward , " he wrote .
" as a matter of principle and coherence , we should send a clear signal of our willingness to help the us government in that regard , namely through the resettlement of detainees .
as far as the portuguese government is concerned , we will be available to participate . "
german offer not unconditional the german foreign ministry has indicated that the issue of taking in guantanamo inmates will be discussed with the us in january when the czech republic takes over the eu 's presidency .
around 250 prisoners , including the alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , are currently being held at guantanamo bay .
charges have still not been brought against dozens of detainees who have spent years at the controversial facility .
some german politicians have warned that germany 's offer to accept inmates should not be unconditional .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .
but , he said , the danger that prisoners pose " should not be played down . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2008 media : germany stimulus package smaller than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stimulus package might not have as much for infrastructure projects as once thought german papers reported on wednesday , dec .
24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .
5 .
projects are likely to include such things as road construction , broadband internet access and schools . some politicians have called for tax cuts to spur consumer spending , but merkel has said reductions are off the table until september elections . some economists have warned that germany could be facing its worst economic downturn since world war two .

and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .

charges have still not been brought against dozens of detainees who have spent years at the controversial facility .
some german politicians have warned that germany 's offer to accept inmates should not be unconditional .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2008 media : germany stimulus package smaller than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stimulus package might not have as much for infrastructure projects as once thought german papers reported on wednesday , dec .
24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2008 media : germany stimulus package smaller than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stimulus package might not have as much for infrastructure projects as once thought german papers reported on wednesday , dec .
24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .
5 .
projects are likely to include such things as road construction , broadband internet access and schools . some politicians have called for tax cuts to spur consumer spending , but merkel has said reductions are off the table until september elections . some economists have warned that germany could be facing its worst economic downturn since world war two .

and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .
" the time has come for the european union to step forward , " he wrote .
" as a matter of principle and coherence , we should send a clear signal of our willingness to help the us government in that regard , namely through the resettlement of detainees .
as far as the portuguese government is concerned , we will be available to participate . "
german offer not unconditional the german foreign ministry has indicated that the issue of taking in guantanamo inmates will be discussed with the us in january when the czech republic takes over the eu 's presidency .
around 250 prisoners , including the alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , are currently being held at guantanamo bay .
charges have still not been brought against dozens of detainees who have spent years at the controversial facility .
some german politicians have warned that germany 's offer to accept inmates should not be unconditional .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .
but , he said , the danger that prisoners pose " should not be played down . "

and as his inauguration day draws nearer , european countries are trying to find ways to help him keep that promise .
one especially difficult question obama faces is what to do with those inmates who have been determined to pose no threat but who would face persecution and possibly torture if returned to their home country .
that ’ s where a half-dozen eu nations would now like to step in , according to a new report in the washington post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo has severely dented the international reputation of the us thus far , only germany and portugal have publicly acknowledged their willingness to accept former prisoners in their own countries , with a german ministry spokesman saying monday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has instructed officials to look into political , legal and logistical aspects of the matter .
portuguese foreign minister luís amado likewise promoted the idea to his eu counterparts in a letter made public recently .
" the time has come for the european union to step forward , " he wrote .
" as a matter of principle and coherence , we should send a clear signal of our willingness to help the us government in that regard , namely through the resettlement of detainees .
as far as the portuguese government is concerned , we will be available to participate . "
german offer not unconditional the german foreign ministry has indicated that the issue of taking in guantanamo inmates will be discussed with the us in january when the czech republic takes over the eu 's presidency .
around 250 prisoners , including the alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , are currently being held at guantanamo bay .
charges have still not been brought against dozens of detainees who have spent years at the controversial facility .
some german politicians have warned that germany 's offer to accept inmates should not be unconditional .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conervative christian democrats ' parliamentary group , said germany should not be the first and only country to take in guantanamo prisoners but rather be part of a european initiative to help the prisoners .
he added that germany should consider helping those persons who ca n't return home on humanitarian grounds , if they faced the threat of torture or the death penatly .
but , he said , the danger that prisoners pose " should not be played down . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2008 media : germany stimulus package smaller than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stimulus package might not have as much for infrastructure projects as once thought german papers reported on wednesday , dec .
24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier . the sueddeutsche zeitung and the frankfurter rundschau have both reported in their wednesday editions that the 25-billion-euro plan came out of a meeting on tuesday between chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff and representatives from germany 's 16 federal states . the volume is less than expected .
german newsmagazine der spiegel had earlier reported that a package worth up to 40 billion euros could emerge .
but according to the sueddeutsche , germany is unwilling to spend more due its wish to adhere to strict eu deficit rules . citing unnamed government officials , the sueddeutsche reported that some 10 billion would be used to reduce social security contributions and billions would also be made available for tax cuts .
the paper quoted a government official as saying several billion would be made available for infrastructure projects . finance minister peer steinbrueck has not confirmed the reported amount , saying everything still was being considered . but ingolf deubel , finance minister of the western state of rheinland-palatinate , confirmed the figure of 25 billion euros in an interview with germany 's rhein-zeitung newspaper .
deubel , who took part in the tuesday meeting , said it was unclear how much would go to new investments .
sticking to the rules germany sees itself as a guardian of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which puts strict limitations on deficits and debt , and doesn ’ t want to provide a pretext for countries such as france and italy to soften the pact ’ s rules , the newspaper said .
eu rules limit deficits to three percent of gdp , or 75 billion euros in germany 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say a stimulus package is necessary to help germany fight recession , but how much ?
the paper said the global economic storm has resulted in a 50-billion-euro deficit , which leaves 25 billion euros available for a second package . germany has already put in place a series of measures that berlin says is worth 31 billion , but angela merkel and her government are under pressure to do more to help germany withstand the worst of the financial crisis . at tuesday 's meeting , officials from the federal states were asked to bring concrete proposals for projects that could be funded by the stimulus package to another discussion meeting on jan .
5 .
projects are likely to include such things as road construction , broadband internet access and schools . some politicians have called for tax cuts to spur consumer spending , but merkel has said reductions are off the table until september elections . some economists have warned that germany could be facing its worst economic downturn since world war two .

that 's perfect for playing online games , which is a sort of national pastime there .
now there 's a growing fear that korean children are becoming addicted to the net .
but some question whether internet addiction is an addiction at all . twelve year old oh tae june says he has a problem .
he rocks back in forth in a vinyl chair and explains why his parents sent him to a special 12 day camp that ’ s supposed to help break him of a bad habit .
oh says he came to the internet rescue camp to break his addiction to the internet .
he used to play games a lot , sometimes he ’ d spend 16 hours a day in front of a computer . he adds his parents always got angry at him .
there are 20 other kids at the camp who are just like oh . throughout the program the boys learn new hobbies like drumming , making pottery or camping outdoors . anything to get their minds off the internet . counselling to help addicts this plus multiple sessions of anger management and one on one counseling has reduced the amount of time they spend online once they go back home .
that 's according to the korea youth counseling institute , the organization that runs the internet rescue camp . counselor jang have ah says 14 point four percent of south korea 's nine million schoolchildren show signs of internet addiction . she says this high number has a lot to do with south korea ’ s high speed internet connections and changes to the traditional family structure . “ our government pushed us to embrace the it industry and that 's caused negative side effects like online ad diction ” , jang says . “ this happened as families became smaller and children were left alone while both parents were out working . ”
she defines this compulsion as spending four hours or more online each day ; symptoms include developing stiff wrists and hearing sounds from online games even when offline .
in response to this condition ’ s prevalence , seoul has opened hundreds of internet counseling centers nationwide and supports treatment programs at dozens of hospitals .
the rescue camp receives 100 percent funding from the government .
scepticism about the treatment but some critics say this is a waste of taxpayers ' money . whang sang min is a psychology professor at yonsei university and has written several books about korean online culture .
he says just because someone spends an excessive amount of time online does not mean they are actually addicted . " i interviewed lots of online gamers , who look like really addicted kid . they spend 5 , 7 hours per day on playing games .
but one day , some of them said they do n't like this game anymore , they want to change it . that 's the day they get rid of all their account and items and they change it , and they do n't play anymore . so , it 's not addictive behaviors . "
whang says programs like the internet rescue camp , which use methods for treating drug or alcohol abuse , ca n't adequately resolve the problems that might cause a person to go online compulsively . but the on-line addiction treatment seems to have worked for oh tae june .
he says he does n't really miss playing online games at all and is sure that he wo n't go back to his old ways once he returns home .
oh says he ’ s sure he will be able to do the same things there that he did here .

the credit union was set up following the collapse of farepak iin 2006 it has been a busy few weeks for the first alliance credit union in west kilbride .
it was set up by volunteers to help those affected by the collapse of the christmas savings club farepak in 2006 , but now it appears to be the credit crunch that is hitting people 's pockets .
louise mcdaid , was instrumental in establishing the credit union which operates from a community hall in the town every saturday morning .
" it 's been quite an eye-opener setting up the credit union , " she said .
" we were very focused on the issue of farepak at the time and you 're looking for positive to come out of it .
we then established a credit union and started to learn about people who ca n't get their hands on bank accounts , i just assumed everybody had access to bank accounts .
like other financial organisations , provident identifies where its existing customers live and then carries out marketing activity to generate new customers provident financial spokeswoman " you then start to realise that people on benefits ca n't get access to affordable credit .
" we get people coming in who are in dire straits with their gas and electric bills and they ca n't afford to pay so we therefore offer special loans for that .
but we also get small businessmen coming in who are just looking for access to maybe a few thousand pounds to help them out with a car or pieces of equipment to do their business . "
the credit union is open to everybody , but it also lends to people who can not normally get access to bank accounts , as do doorstep lenders , and mrs mcdaid is concerned that these kind of companies are targeting people on low incomes .
she said : " some are horrifying stories when you 've got individuals coming in who 've taken out loans , with for example a provident cheque , and they 're having to pay back 183 % interest on that loan .
i find that absolutely appalling .
how can that type of company be able to prey on people who ca n't get access to affordable credit . "
jean mclardy took out a loan for £ 400 at 183 % interest jean mclardy , a volunteer at the west kilbride collection point , took out a loan through provident financial for £ 400 - it cost her more than £ 300 in interest .
she said : " i was then being asked after i paid that off , why was n't i taking out any more ?
and i said " well , the interest rate . "
and still for about a year or more i was getting letters .
" i got one to see if i wanted a provident credit card .
there was a phone call to the house a couple of weeks ago for my mum , now she 's 72 , they 're asking if she wants a loan .
it 's just too high a rate and i would never do it again . "
charging structure a spokeswoman from provident financial defended the company 's interest rates , explaining that its charging structure was different to that of other lenders so comparisons were misleading .
she said : " provident home credit has a single , up-front , fixed charge that customers see from the start , which includes the cost of setting up the loan , the interest on the loan , the cost of the agent 's weekly visit , and the fact that the total amount of repay will never go up - even if payments are missed . "
but she conceded marketing was targeted at specific areas .
she said : " like other financial organisations , provident identifies where its existing customers live and then carries out marketing activity to generate new customers in those same area and in areas similar to them . "
the office of fair trading is currently conducting a review into irresponsible lending and a spokeswoman said doorstep credit may form part of that study .
in the meantime , the volunteers in west kilbride hope more credit unions will be set up across the country to allow greater access to cheaper borrowing .

the credit union was set up following the collapse of farepak iin 2006 it has been a busy few weeks for the first alliance credit union in west kilbride .
it was set up by volunteers to help those affected by the collapse of the christmas savings club farepak in 2006 , but now it appears to be the credit crunch that is hitting people 's pockets .
louise mcdaid , was instrumental in establishing the credit union which operates from a community hall in the town every saturday morning .
" it 's been quite an eye-opener setting up the credit union , " she said .
" we were very focused on the issue of farepak at the time and you 're looking for positive to come out of it .
we then established a credit union and started to learn about people who ca n't get their hands on bank accounts , i just assumed everybody had access to bank accounts .
like other financial organisations , provident identifies where its existing customers live and then carries out marketing activity to generate new customers provident financial spokeswoman " you then start to realise that people on benefits ca n't get access to affordable credit .
" we get people coming in who are in dire straits with their gas and electric bills and they ca n't afford to pay so we therefore offer special loans for that .
but we also get small businessmen coming in who are just looking for access to maybe a few thousand pounds to help them out with a car or pieces of equipment to do their business . "
the credit union is open to everybody , but it also lends to people who can not normally get access to bank accounts , as do doorstep lenders , and mrs mcdaid is concerned that these kind of companies are targeting people on low incomes .
she said : " some are horrifying stories when you 've got individuals coming in who 've taken out loans , with for example a provident cheque , and they 're having to pay back 183 % interest on that loan .
i find that absolutely appalling .
how can that type of company be able to prey on people who ca n't get access to affordable credit . "
jean mclardy took out a loan for £ 400 at 183 % interest jean mclardy , a volunteer at the west kilbride collection point , took out a loan through provident financial for £ 400 - it cost her more than £ 300 in interest .
she said : " i was then being asked after i paid that off , why was n't i taking out any more ?
and i said " well , the interest rate . "
and still for about a year or more i was getting letters .
" i got one to see if i wanted a provident credit card .
there was a phone call to the house a couple of weeks ago for my mum , now she 's 72 , they 're asking if she wants a loan .
it 's just too high a rate and i would never do it again . "
charging structure a spokeswoman from provident financial defended the company 's interest rates , explaining that its charging structure was different to that of other lenders so comparisons were misleading .
she said : " provident home credit has a single , up-front , fixed charge that customers see from the start , which includes the cost of setting up the loan , the interest on the loan , the cost of the agent 's weekly visit , and the fact that the total amount of repay will never go up - even if payments are missed . "
but she conceded marketing was targeted at specific areas .
she said : " like other financial organisations , provident identifies where its existing customers live and then carries out marketing activity to generate new customers in those same area and in areas similar to them . "
the office of fair trading is currently conducting a review into irresponsible lending and a spokeswoman said doorstep credit may form part of that study .
in the meantime , the volunteers in west kilbride hope more credit unions will be set up across the country to allow greater access to cheaper borrowing .

it has been a busy few weeks for the first alliance credit union in west kilbride .
it was set up by volunteers to help those affected by the collapse of the christmas savings club farepak in 2006 , but now it appears to be the credit crunch that is hitting people 's pockets .
louise mcdaid , was instrumental in establishing the credit union which operates from a community hall in the town every saturday morning .
" it 's been quite an eye-opener setting up the credit union , " she said .
" we were very focused on the issue of farepak at the time and you 're looking for positive to come out of it .
we then established a credit union and started to learn about people who ca n't get their hands on bank accounts , i just assumed everybody had access to bank accounts . "
like other financial organisations , provident identifies where its existing customers live and then carries out marketing activity to generate new customers " provident financial spokeswoman " you then start to realise that people on benefits ca n't get access to affordable credit .
" we get people coming in who are in dire straits with their gas and electric bills and they ca n't afford to pay so we therefore offer special loans for that .
but we also get small businessmen coming in who are just looking for access to maybe a few thousand pounds to help them out with a car or pieces of equipment to do their business . "
the credit union is open to everybody , but it also lends to people who can not normally get access to bank accounts , as do doorstep lenders , and mrs mcdaid is concerned that these kind of companies are targeting people on low incomes .
she said : " some are horrifying stories when you 've got individuals coming in who 've taken out loans , with for example a provident cheque , and they 're having to pay back 183 % interest on that loan .
i find that absolutely appalling .
how can that type of company be able to prey on people who ca n't get access to affordable credit . "
jean mclardy , a volunteer at the west kilbride collection point , took out a loan through provident financial for £ 400 - it cost her more than £ 300 in interest .
she said : " i was then being asked after i paid that off , why was n't i taking out any more ?
and i said " well , the interest rate . "
and still for about a year or more i was getting letters .
" i got one to see if i wanted a provident credit card .
there was a phone call to the house a couple of weeks ago for my mum , now she 's 72 , they 're asking if she wants a loan .
it 's just too high a rate and i would never do it again . "
charging structure a spokeswoman from provident financial defended the company 's interest rates , explaining that its charging structure was different to that of other lenders so comparisons were misleading .
she said : " provident home credit has a single , up-front , fixed charge that customers see from the start , which includes the cost of setting up the loan , the interest on the loan , the cost of the agent 's weekly visit , and the fact that the total amount of repay will never go up - even if payments are missed . "
but she conceded marketing was targeted at specific areas .
she said : " like other financial organisations , provident identifies where its existing customers live and then carries out marketing activity to generate new customers in those same area and in areas similar to them . "
the office of fair trading is currently conducting a review into irresponsible lending and a spokeswoman said doorstep credit may form part of that study .
in the meantime , the volunteers in west kilbride hope more credit unions will be set up across the country to allow greater access to cheaper borrowing .

for the first time in more than 200 years , salmon have reached their spawning grounds on the coy burn , a tributary of the river dee , under their own steam - thanks to a salmon ladder unique to deeside .
set in the coy , just half-a-mile from the 16th century crathes castle , in aberdeenshire , the ladder deploys a sophisticated counting and measuring system .
it allows for the critical monitoring of salmon - as well as sea and brown trout - as they tenaciously battle their way back to spawning grounds upstream from the estate mill pond .
this ladder , attached to the dam on the coy burn , holds back the water which creates the mill pond . "
this is a complicated project , as the dam has obviously historical and ecological importance " fiona milne crathes castle ranger there has been a dam in one form or another on the pond since at least the 1590s .
with modifications over the centuries , the existing dam has been a permanent structure since the late 18th century .
before the pass was built , salmon were caught in nets downstream of the dam and lifted into the mill pond to make their way through it to join the coy burn again , swimming further upstream to spawn .
more development work has been undertaken on neighbouring estates , to find further suitable spawning grounds .
fiona milne , senior ranger at crathes castle estate , expressed excitement over the success of the ladder .
' complicated project ' " earlier in november , i had the joy of standing with the fishery board 's water bailiff watching some of the first salmon in over 200 years making their way to their spawning grounds under their own steam - 45 fish had gone through in one week alone , " she said .
" this is a complicated project , as the dam has obviously historical and ecological importance , so it not only involved the nature conservation staff , but also the archaeologist and building surveyors . "
she said the movement of the fish was a thrilling spectacle that left a lasting impression .
the £ 70,000 project was funded by the conservation of atlantic salmon in scotland project -lrb- cass -rrb- and has involved many partners including national trust for scotland , river dee trust , the dee district salmon fishery board and the neighbouring leys estate .
the cass project , which ran from 2004 until august 2008 , was the single most significant salmon conservation project ever undertaken in scotland .
mark bilsby , of the river dee trust , said the installation of the ladder under the cass scheme became a real community project .
" we drew in 17 local schools to be closely involved and created seven fish passes around the dee catchment area , " he said .
" overall , we also created 37 kilometres of riverside buffer strips and coppiced 21 kilometres too . "
mr bilsby said it was the most satisfying job he had ever undertaken .
" it makes all the paperwork worthwhile , " he said .

" this is a complicated project , as the dam has obviously historical and ecological importance , so it not only involved the nature conservation staff , but also the archaeologist and building surveyors . "
the £ 70,000 project received funding from a number of backers she said the movement of the fish was a thrilling spectacle that left a lasting impression .
the £ 70,000 project was funded by the conservation of atlantic salmon in scotland project -lrb- cass -rrb- and has involved many partners including national trust for scotland , river dee trust , the dee district salmon fishery board and the neighbouring leys estate .
the cass project , which ran from 2004 until august 2008 , was the single most significant salmon conservation project ever undertaken in scotland .
mark bilsby , of the river dee trust , said the installation of the ladder under the cass scheme became a real community project .
" we drew in 17 local schools to be closely involved and created seven fish passes around the dee catchment area , " he said .
" overall , we also created 37 kilometres of riverside buffer strips and coppiced 21 kilometres too . "
mr bilsby said it was the most satisfying job he had ever undertaken .
" it makes all the paperwork worthwhile , " he said .

it is part of a 7.5bn euro package that includes funding from the european union , world bank and other countries .
it will allow latvia to maintain its currency 's peg to the euro , but there will be sacrifices such as cuts in public sector wages and state spending .
value added tax will be raised from 18 % to 21 % , which has prompted protests in the capital , riga .
latvia has also agreed to keep its budget deficit below 5 % of gross domestic product next year and reduce it to 3 % by 2011 .
the other countries involved in the bail-out are the czech republic , poland , estonia and the nordic countries .
the nordic states , and especially sweden , are involved because their banks have loaned a lot of money in latvia , and so would be damaged if its economy were to deteriorate any further .
meanwhile , other countries nearby have been keen to help because of the damage that would be done to them if latvia 's currency were to be devalued .
