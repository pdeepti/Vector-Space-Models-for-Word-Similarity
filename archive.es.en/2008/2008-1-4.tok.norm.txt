european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .

my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .

another 10 would-be immigrants from chechnya were apprehended on the same highway later in the week . dozens more have been caught in trains between warsaw and berlin and between the southern polish region of silesia and vienna , austria . " illegal immigration is a business that is almost entirely run by organized crime , " josef scheuring , chairman of the gdp police union , told the associated press .
his organization had protested lifting border controls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 04.01.2008 german ex-hostage encourages captives to persevere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian rebels are holding over 200 hostages ulrich künzel was kidnapped by colombian guerillas in 2001 while working on german development projects .
he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , but illegal immigration has peaked .
many of those caught heading for germany are chechens with asylum status in poland . concerns that bands of criminals from eastern europe would stream into germany after its eastern borders were lifted last month have proved unfounded . burglaries , thefts and traffic offences have been about the same since dec .
21 as they were prior to the expansion to the visa-free schengen zone , said police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without checkpoints , traffic has improved in the border regions , say police the stable crime rate likely has to do with increased police presence , said brandenburg state police spokesman peter salender . " it 's like the 2006 soccer world cup when there were hardly any cases of theft or assault simply because there were so many police around , " he said . while border checks have been removed , police are now conducting mobile patrols in the border regions as part of a new strategy . immigrants overwhelmingly from chechnya the effective removal of passport checks on germany 's eastern border has led to more people attempting to enter germany illegally .
a disproportionate number of those caught come from the war-torn russian province of chechnya and hold asylum papers that are valid in poland but not in the rest of the schengen area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine countries joined the schengen area of dec .

25 , police stopped 18 chechens traveling in polish taxis on the motorway connecting berlin with stettin in poland .
they were deported to poland , where they had legal residency .
another 10 would-be immigrants from chechnya were apprehended on the same highway later in the week . dozens more have been caught in trains between warsaw and berlin and between the southern polish region of silesia and vienna , austria . " illegal immigration is a business that is almost entirely run by organized crime , " josef scheuring , chairman of the gdp police union , told the associated press .
his organization had protested lifting border controls .
" the transit gangs are only beginning to feel out the possibilities . " asylum status only valid in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is bitter in chechnya currently , more than 7,000 chechens have leave to remain in poland and 1,782 received legal asylum status in 2007 , according to a report by dpa news agency . formerly part of the soviet union , chechnya declared independence in 1991 .
the caucasian republic was torn apart by two wars with russia in the 1990s , causing many chechens to flee westward . sonta said that the polish parliament , the sejm , is currently redrafting its asylum and immigration laws to bring them in alignment with european union requirements . poland joined the eu in 2004 .
it became part of the schengen area on dec .
21 along with seven other eastern european countries , bringing total membership to 24 states .

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.01.2008 opinion : turn up the heat on kenya 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in kenya remains precarious in the aftermath of the allegedly fixed presidential elections .
the world is right to insist on an investigation together with the african union , says dw 's andrea schmidt . there 's no question about it : the devastating unrest in kenya following the elections is a harsh setback for democracy in kenya and for the african continent as a whole . though it is located in a politically sensitive region , kenya has been considered a model of economic progress and reform and has been an important and abiding ally of the us in the war on terror . the international community does n't want to lose an ally and model country .
maybe that 's why the us hastily applauded kenya for holding free elections .
the us , however , has since revoked its congratulations and joined the un and eu in demanding a peaceful solution to the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schmidt the majority of kenya 's neighbors , on the other hand , have remained strangely silent - the african union wo n't mediate after all and uganda 's long-time ruler yoveri museveni has even congratulated the disputed winner mwai kibaki .
both cases are fatal reminders of the powerlessness of the african nations , which have n't stood up to zimbabwe 's despot robert mugabe either . independent probe needed the international community is nevertheless right to demand a public and independent re-evaluation of the election results .
this should happen with the involvement of the african union as soon as possible .
we can only hope that the visit by the chairman of the african union , ghanaian president john kufuor , wo n't be postponed for too long . the international community has to make it clear to kibaki that he can not legally govern the country after a manipulated election . some politicians have called for mediation from china - which , like europe , sees africa as a deliverer of natural resources - but this is beside the point . there is significant concern that the unrest will spread to other eastern african nations that rely on kenya as a coastal transit country .
many neighboring countries are dependent on kenya , the most industrialized in the region , for essential imports like vegetable oil , salt and flour .
landlocked countries in eastern africa like uganda , rwanda , burundi and east congo also get their gasoline via kenya . supplies have already become scarce . a dead-end situation kibaki has gotten himself into a dead-end situation and has irreversibly lost his credibility .
the schisms between the many ethnic groups in kenya have to be bridged as soon as possible so that the country does n't sink into chaos . the international community should turn up the pressure on kibaki to force him into having the election results publicly and independently re-evaluated and holding new elections if necessary . nor evertything , however , is bleak these days .
the results of the parliamentary elections , held parallel to the presidential election , give hope for kenya 's further development .
using democratic means , the kenyans showed the old guard of politicians that they 'd had enough of their power abuse , cronyism and corruption by voting them out . andrea schmidt directs dw-radio 's kiswahili program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 04.01.2008 american primary system fails to impress europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama -lrb- left -rrb- and huckabee came out on top in iowa after intense campaigning there the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , but illegal immigration has peaked .
many of those caught heading for germany are chechens with asylum status in poland . concerns that bands of criminals from eastern europe would stream into germany after its eastern borders were lifted last month have proved unfounded . burglaries , thefts and traffic offences have been about the same since dec .
21 as they were prior to the expansion to the visa-free schengen zone , said police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without checkpoints , traffic has improved in the border regions , say police the stable crime rate likely has to do with increased police presence , said brandenburg state police spokesman peter salender . " it 's like the 2006 soccer world cup when there were hardly any cases of theft or assault simply because there were so many police around , " he said . while border checks have been removed , police are now conducting mobile patrols in the border regions as part of a new strategy . immigrants overwhelmingly from chechnya the effective removal of passport checks on germany 's eastern border has led to more people attempting to enter germany illegally .
a disproportionate number of those caught come from the war-torn russian province of chechnya and hold asylum papers that are valid in poland but not in the rest of the schengen area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine countries joined the schengen area of dec .
21 , 2007 " the majority of the cases - 99 percent - involve russian nationals from chechnya , " jacek sonta from the polish border guard told dw-world.de. on dec .
25 , police stopped 18 chechens traveling in polish taxis on the motorway connecting berlin with stettin in poland .
they were deported to poland , where they had legal residency .
another 10 would-be immigrants from chechnya were apprehended on the same highway later in the week . dozens more have been caught in trains between warsaw and berlin and between the southern polish region of silesia and vienna , austria . " illegal immigration is a business that is almost entirely run by organized crime , " josef scheuring , chairman of the gdp police union , told the associated press .
his organization had protested lifting border controls .
" the transit gangs are only beginning to feel out the possibilities . " asylum status only valid in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is bitter in chechnya currently , more than 7,000 chechens have leave to remain in poland and 1,782 received legal asylum status in 2007 , according to a report by dpa news agency . formerly part of the soviet union , chechnya declared independence in 1991 .
the caucasian republic was torn apart by two wars with russia in the 1990s , causing many chechens to flee westward . sonta said that the polish parliament , the sejm , is currently redrafting its asylum and immigration laws to bring them in alignment with european union requirements . poland joined the eu in 2004 .

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.01.2008 opinion : turn up the heat on kenya 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in kenya remains precarious in the aftermath of the allegedly fixed presidential elections .
the world is right to insist on an investigation together with the african union , says dw 's andrea schmidt . there 's no question about it : the devastating unrest in kenya following the elections is a harsh setback for democracy in kenya and for the african continent as a whole . though it is located in a politically sensitive region , kenya has been considered a model of economic progress and reform and has been an important and abiding ally of the us in the war on terror . the international community does n't want to lose an ally and model country .
maybe that 's why the us hastily applauded kenya for holding free elections .
the us , however , has since revoked its congratulations and joined the un and eu in demanding a peaceful solution to the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schmidt the majority of kenya 's neighbors , on the other hand , have remained strangely silent - the african union wo n't mediate after all and uganda 's long-time ruler yoveri museveni has even congratulated the disputed winner mwai kibaki .
both cases are fatal reminders of the powerlessness of the african nations , which have n't stood up to zimbabwe 's despot robert mugabe either . independent probe needed the international community is nevertheless right to demand a public and independent re-evaluation of the election results .
this should happen with the involvement of the african union as soon as possible .
we can only hope that the visit by the chairman of the african union , ghanaian president john kufuor , wo n't be postponed for too long . the international community has to make it clear to kibaki that he can not legally govern the country after a manipulated election . some politicians have called for mediation from china - which , like europe , sees africa as a deliverer of natural resources - but this is beside the point . there is significant concern that the unrest will spread to other eastern african nations that rely on kenya as a coastal transit country .
many neighboring countries are dependent on kenya , the most industrialized in the region , for essential imports like vegetable oil , salt and flour .
landlocked countries in eastern africa like uganda , rwanda , burundi and east congo also get their gasoline via kenya . supplies have already become scarce . a dead-end situation kibaki has gotten himself into a dead-end situation and has irreversibly lost his credibility .
the schisms between the many ethnic groups in kenya have to be bridged as soon as possible so that the country does n't sink into chaos . the international community should turn up the pressure on kibaki to force him into having the election results publicly and independently re-evaluated and holding new elections if necessary . nor evertything , however , is bleak these days .
the results of the parliamentary elections , held parallel to the presidential election , give hope for kenya 's further development .
using democratic means , the kenyans showed the old guard of politicians that they 'd had enough of their power abuse , cronyism and corruption by voting them out . andrea schmidt directs dw-radio 's kiswahili program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us , however , has since revoked its congratulations and joined the un and eu in demanding a peaceful solution to the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schmidt the majority of kenya 's neighbors , on the other hand , have remained strangely silent - the african union wo n't mediate after all and uganda 's long-time ruler yoveri museveni has even congratulated the disputed winner mwai kibaki .
both cases are fatal reminders of the powerlessness of the african nations , which have n't stood up to zimbabwe 's despot robert mugabe either . independent probe needed the international community is nevertheless right to demand a public and independent re-evaluation of the election results .
this should happen with the involvement of the african union as soon as possible .
we can only hope that the visit by the chairman of the african union , ghanaian president john kufuor , wo n't be postponed for too long . the international community has to make it clear to kibaki that he can not legally govern the country after a manipulated election . some politicians have called for mediation from china - which , like europe , sees africa as a deliverer of natural resources - but this is beside the point . there is significant concern that the unrest will spread to other eastern african nations that rely on kenya as a coastal transit country .
many neighboring countries are dependent on kenya , the most industrialized in the region , for essential imports like vegetable oil , salt and flour .
landlocked countries in eastern africa like uganda , rwanda , burundi and east congo also get their gasoline via kenya . supplies have already become scarce . a dead-end situation kibaki has gotten himself into a dead-end situation and has irreversibly lost his credibility .
the schisms between the many ethnic groups in kenya have to be bridged as soon as possible so that the country does n't sink into chaos . the international community should turn up the pressure on kibaki to force him into having the election results publicly and independently re-evaluated and holding new elections if necessary . nor evertything , however , is bleak these days .
the results of the parliamentary elections , held parallel to the presidential election , give hope for kenya 's further development .
using democratic means , the kenyans showed the old guard of politicians that they 'd had enough of their power abuse , cronyism and corruption by voting them out . andrea schmidt directs dw-radio 's kiswahili program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .

" generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .

" it 's like the 2006 soccer world cup when there were hardly any cases of theft or assault simply because there were so many police around , " he said . while border checks have been removed , police are now conducting mobile patrols in the border regions as part of a new strategy . immigrants overwhelmingly from chechnya the effective removal of passport checks on germany 's eastern border has led to more people attempting to enter germany illegally .

they were deported to poland , where they had legal residency .
another 10 would-be immigrants from chechnya were apprehended on the same highway later in the week . dozens more have been caught in trains between warsaw and berlin and between the southern polish region of silesia and vienna , austria . " illegal immigration is a business that is almost entirely run by organized crime , " josef scheuring , chairman of the gdp police union , told the associated press .
his organization had protested lifting border controls .
" the transit gangs are only beginning to feel out the possibilities .

the caucasian republic was torn apart by two wars with russia in the 1990s , causing many chechens to flee westward . sonta said that the polish parliament , the sejm , is currently redrafting its asylum and immigration laws to bring them in alignment with european union requirements . poland joined the eu in 2004 .

the world is right to insist on an investigation together with the african union , says dw 's andrea schmidt . there 's no question about it : the devastating unrest in kenya following the elections is a harsh setback for democracy in kenya and for the african continent as a whole . though it is located in a politically sensitive region , kenya has been considered a model of economic progress and reform and has been an important and abiding ally of the us in the war on terror . the international community does n't want to lose an ally and model country .
maybe that 's why the us hastily applauded kenya for holding free elections .
the us , however , has since revoked its congratulations and joined the un and eu in demanding a peaceful solution to the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schmidt the majority of kenya 's neighbors , on the other hand , have remained strangely silent - the african union wo n't mediate after all and uganda 's long-time ruler yoveri museveni has even congratulated the disputed winner mwai kibaki .
both cases are fatal reminders of the powerlessness of the african nations , which have n't stood up to zimbabwe 's despot robert mugabe either . independent probe needed the international community is nevertheless right to demand a public and independent re-evaluation of the election results .
this should happen with the involvement of the african union as soon as possible .
we can only hope that the visit by the chairman of the african union , ghanaian president john kufuor , wo n't be postponed for too long . the international community has to make it clear to kibaki that he can not legally govern the country after a manipulated election . some politicians have called for mediation from china - which , like europe , sees africa as a deliverer of natural resources - but this is beside the point . there is significant concern that the unrest will spread to other eastern african nations that rely on kenya as a coastal transit country .
many neighboring countries are dependent on kenya , the most industrialized in the region , for essential imports like vegetable oil , salt and flour .
landlocked countries in eastern africa like uganda , rwanda , burundi and east congo also get their gasoline via kenya . supplies have already become scarce . a dead-end situation kibaki has gotten himself into a dead-end situation and has irreversibly lost his credibility .
the schisms between the many ethnic groups in kenya have to be bridged as soon as possible so that the country does n't sink into chaos . the international community should turn up the pressure on kibaki to force him into having the election results publicly and independently re-evaluated and holding new elections if necessary . nor evertything , however , is bleak these days .
the results of the parliamentary elections , held parallel to the presidential election , give hope for kenya 's further development .
using democratic means , the kenyans showed the old guard of politicians that they 'd had enough of their power abuse , cronyism and corruption by voting them out . andrea schmidt directs dw-radio 's kiswahili program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .

that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 04.01.2008 german ex-hostage encourages captives to persevere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian rebels are holding over 200 hostages ulrich künzel was kidnapped by colombian guerillas in 2001 while working on german development projects .
he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 04.01.2008 american primary system fails to impress europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama -lrb- left -rrb- and huckabee came out on top in iowa after intense campaigning there the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 04.01.2008 german ex-hostage encourages captives to persevere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian rebels are holding over 200 hostages ulrich künzel was kidnapped by colombian guerillas in 2001 while working on german development projects .
he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , but illegal immigration has peaked .
many of those caught heading for germany are chechens with asylum status in poland . concerns that bands of criminals from eastern europe would stream into germany after its eastern borders were lifted last month have proved unfounded . burglaries , thefts and traffic offences have been about the same since dec .
21 as they were prior to the expansion to the visa-free schengen zone , said police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without checkpoints , traffic has improved in the border regions , say police the stable crime rate likely has to do with increased police presence , said brandenburg state police spokesman peter salender . " it 's like the 2006 soccer world cup when there were hardly any cases of theft or assault simply because there were so many police around , " he said . while border checks have been removed , police are now conducting mobile patrols in the border regions as part of a new strategy . immigrants overwhelmingly from chechnya the effective removal of passport checks on germany 's eastern border has led to more people attempting to enter germany illegally .
a disproportionate number of those caught come from the war-torn russian province of chechnya and hold asylum papers that are valid in poland but not in the rest of the schengen area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine countries joined the schengen area of dec .

they were deported to poland , where they had legal residency .
another 10 would-be immigrants from chechnya were apprehended on the same highway later in the week . dozens more have been caught in trains between warsaw and berlin and between the southern polish region of silesia and vienna , austria . " illegal immigration is a business that is almost entirely run by organized crime , " josef scheuring , chairman of the gdp police union , told the associated press .
his organization had protested lifting border controls .
" the transit gangs are only beginning to feel out the possibilities . " asylum status only valid in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is bitter in chechnya currently , more than 7,000 chechens have leave to remain in poland and 1,782 received legal asylum status in 2007 , according to a report by dpa news agency . formerly part of the soviet union , chechnya declared independence in 1991 .
the caucasian republic was torn apart by two wars with russia in the 1990s , causing many chechens to flee westward . sonta said that the polish parliament , the sejm , is currently redrafting its asylum and immigration laws to bring them in alignment with european union requirements . poland joined the eu in 2004 .
it became part of the schengen area on dec .

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones .

a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out .

" the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .

unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .

european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .

european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 04.01.2008 american primary system fails to impress europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama -lrb- left -rrb- and huckabee came out on top in iowa after intense campaigning there the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated . in just over 10 months ' time , us voters will elect their next president .
between now and then , election politics will take center stage in the us .
much of the discourse will be civilized : televised debates , town hall meetings and fundraising dinners .
but smear campaigns and scandals will also likely elbow their way into the spotlight . at this point , the field is still wide open on both the democratic and republican sides .
on thursday , jan .
3 , party members in iowa gave their opinions on who should be the next us president , with democrat barack obama and republican mike huckabee taking home their parties ' endorsements .
by feb .
5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.01.2008 opinion : turn up the heat on kenya 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in kenya remains precarious in the aftermath of the allegedly fixed presidential elections .
the world is right to insist on an investigation together with the african union , says dw 's andrea schmidt . there 's no question about it : the devastating unrest in kenya following the elections is a harsh setback for democracy in kenya and for the african continent as a whole . though it is located in a politically sensitive region , kenya has been considered a model of economic progress and reform and has been an important and abiding ally of the us in the war on terror . the international community does n't want to lose an ally and model country .
maybe that 's why the us hastily applauded kenya for holding free elections .
the us , however , has since revoked its congratulations and joined the un and eu in demanding a peaceful solution to the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schmidt the majority of kenya 's neighbors , on the other hand , have remained strangely silent - the african union wo n't mediate after all and uganda 's long-time ruler yoveri museveni has even congratulated the disputed winner mwai kibaki .
both cases are fatal reminders of the powerlessness of the african nations , which have n't stood up to zimbabwe 's despot robert mugabe either . independent probe needed the international community is nevertheless right to demand a public and independent re-evaluation of the election results .
this should happen with the involvement of the african union as soon as possible .
we can only hope that the visit by the chairman of the african union , ghanaian president john kufuor , wo n't be postponed for too long . the international community has to make it clear to kibaki that he can not legally govern the country after a manipulated election . some politicians have called for mediation from china - which , like europe , sees africa as a deliverer of natural resources - but this is beside the point . there is significant concern that the unrest will spread to other eastern african nations that rely on kenya as a coastal transit country .
many neighboring countries are dependent on kenya , the most industrialized in the region , for essential imports like vegetable oil , salt and flour .
landlocked countries in eastern africa like uganda , rwanda , burundi and east congo also get their gasoline via kenya . supplies have already become scarce . a dead-end situation kibaki has gotten himself into a dead-end situation and has irreversibly lost his credibility .
the schisms between the many ethnic groups in kenya have to be bridged as soon as possible so that the country does n't sink into chaos . the international community should turn up the pressure on kibaki to force him into having the election results publicly and independently re-evaluated and holding new elections if necessary . nor evertything , however , is bleak these days .
the results of the parliamentary elections , held parallel to the presidential election , give hope for kenya 's further development .
using democratic means , the kenyans showed the old guard of politicians that they 'd had enough of their power abuse , cronyism and corruption by voting them out . andrea schmidt directs dw-radio 's kiswahili program . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 04.01.2008 german ex-hostage encourages captives to persevere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian rebels are holding over 200 hostages ulrich künzel was kidnapped by colombian guerillas in 2001 while working on german development projects .
he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , most other states will have held primaries to determine their preferred candidates . all about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat john edwards is among his party 's frontrunners national elections in europe often last only six weeks and campaigns are publicly financed .
that makes the details of the united states ' prolonged primary season , the winner-takes-all electoral college and campaign financing groups particularly murky waters for europeans . " quite frankly the american democratic system is atavistic , " said frank unger , an expert on us politics and a professor at the john f. kennedy institute , which is part of the freie university in berlin .
" it 's outdated .
it does n't really reflect democracy in a modern sense . " in iowa , a small number of voters are courted by politicians for months .
the entire political circus brings tens of millions of dollars to the state .
that so much money and energy would be spent on so few voters is a perfect example of how us elections are money driven , said thomas greven of the berlin-based german institute for international relations . in the last elections , george w. bush and his challenger john kerry each raised more than $ 300 million -lrb- 203 million euros -rrb- for their campaigns .
the total amount spent by political action committees , political parties and the candidates is thought to have reached $ 1 billion . reforms ca n't change money game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democrat hillary clinton has proved a successful fundraiser attempts at campaign finance reform tried to stem the influence of money in politics , but little progress was made , according to a report by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the group said the efforts were largely circumvented by special interest groups unaffiliated with the candidates spending huge sums on political issue advertising . the osce monitored the last presidential election in 2004 at the invitation of the us government .
it 's likely that observers will be sent again this year , although an invitation would n't come until a few months before the elections , said spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir . support for party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican fred thompson besides being driven by money , american politics has also become too personalized , unger said . " generally , i feel that the way american democracy developed into the 21st century , if you would judge it objectively , you would say this is not adequate anymore , " unger said . unger said recent presidential elections have become a " battle of personalities " where everything is focused on the candidate while important issues have been ignored .
unger said he 's hopeful that will change somewhat in this election , though the system works against taking the focus off candidates and putting it on issues . in parliamentary systems , people vote for political parties , which in turn decide who will fill leadership posts .
unger said he feels the us would be better off if it moved to a proportional system similar to what is used in germany , where parties get a number of seats in parliament based on their votes . this allows for a broader range of political parties to be represented in government , which is important for a lively democracy , unger said . calls for a new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney trailed huckabee in iowa while many are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude until the parties decide on their candidates , europeans are closely watching the election . their hope is that the candidates - whoever they are - will understand that even domestic issues , such as climate change or domestic security , have international components and impacts , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich . politicians have to understand that " everything is really connected with everything , " bauer said .
" there 's no option of being isolationist anymore . " bauer said whether an international approach is taken will depend entirely on which candidates advance to the general elections .
europeans are hopeful , bauer said , that whoever is at the top of the party tickets will realize the importance of us policy in a global context . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , but illegal immigration has peaked .
many of those caught heading for germany are chechens with asylum status in poland . concerns that bands of criminals from eastern europe would stream into germany after its eastern borders were lifted last month have proved unfounded . burglaries , thefts and traffic offences have been about the same since dec .
21 as they were prior to the expansion to the visa-free schengen zone , said police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without checkpoints , traffic has improved in the border regions , say police the stable crime rate likely has to do with increased police presence , said brandenburg state police spokesman peter salender . " it 's like the 2006 soccer world cup when there were hardly any cases of theft or assault simply because there were so many police around , " he said . while border checks have been removed , police are now conducting mobile patrols in the border regions as part of a new strategy . immigrants overwhelmingly from chechnya the effective removal of passport checks on germany 's eastern border has led to more people attempting to enter germany illegally .
a disproportionate number of those caught come from the war-torn russian province of chechnya and hold asylum papers that are valid in poland but not in the rest of the schengen area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine countries joined the schengen area of dec .

they were deported to poland , where they had legal residency .
another 10 would-be immigrants from chechnya were apprehended on the same highway later in the week . dozens more have been caught in trains between warsaw and berlin and between the southern polish region of silesia and vienna , austria . " illegal immigration is a business that is almost entirely run by organized crime , " josef scheuring , chairman of the gdp police union , told the associated press .
his organization had protested lifting border controls .
" the transit gangs are only beginning to feel out the possibilities . " asylum status only valid in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is bitter in chechnya currently , more than 7,000 chechens have leave to remain in poland and 1,782 received legal asylum status in 2007 , according to a report by dpa news agency . formerly part of the soviet union , chechnya declared independence in 1991 .
the caucasian republic was torn apart by two wars with russia in the 1990s , causing many chechens to flee westward . sonta said that the polish parliament , the sejm , is currently redrafting its asylum and immigration laws to bring them in alignment with european union requirements . poland joined the eu in 2004 .

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world.de about his time in captivity and the ongoing colombian hostage situation . the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- currently has some 200 hostages .
this includes french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , three american citizens and an approximately three-year-old child , who was born from a relationship between a hostage and a guerrilla soldier . the latest rescue deal fell apart on dec .
31 . ulrich künzel , his brother , thomas , and their mutual friend , reiner bruchmann , were kidnapped in 2001 .
künzel was held by the farc for three months before being released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armed conflict has displaced millions dw-world.de : how must it have been for the hostages , who thought they were about to be released , to have the deal crumble at the last minute ? ulrich künzel : i can imagine that the hostages must feel terribly disappointed .
they must feel extreme stress in not knowing whether they will be set free or not .
i know from experience that once you have heard that a release is planned , the time in captivity starts to feel even longer . what happened to you on july 18 , 2001 ? i was traveling to visit a development project in the cauca region in south-western colombia .
my brother and my friend were also in the car when a group of armed men blocked the route and took us away .
at first we did n't know who the kidnappers were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich künzel , center , was held for three months after about three weeks , we heard on the radio a high commander of the farc say the group was responsible for the kidnappings . how important was it to keep up with the news ? the radio was very important . we heard soccer results of the bundesliga on deutsche welle as well as news .
it was our only link to the outside world . it was extremely important .
i was held hostage for three months and during that time did n't have a single thing to read .
the radio was the only medium that was available to find out about things that were happening . during the time we were held hostage , the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks occurred .
i first saw the pictures of it in november , but thanks to the radio , we heard ourselves what had happened in new york and washington . why did the farc target you for kidnapping ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt is the most famous hostage this much is clear : they actually only wanted to kidnap me as they knew that i was working in the area .
my brother and my friend were tragically mixed up in it because the guerrilla group could n't keep us apart during the kidnapping . i was travelling in south-western colombia where we were overseeing many small development projects .
there were places that i could only travel to with the farc 's permission .
so the guerrillas knew that i was there .
but they could n't imagine what kind of work i was doing .
during my captivity , i had to describe for the farc all of the development work germany was doing . it appears that the guerrillas were afraid that germany wanted to give covert military aid to colombia .
subsequently they demanded that germany negotiate development work directly with the farc and not with the government . the farc wanted to be considered an institution of progress and development ? you could say that .
but in the meantime , the policies of president alvaro uribe have significantly limited the area where farc is active .
in 2001 , you could n't say the colombian government had a presence in all parts of the country .
there were many communities where there were absolutely no police has the situation improved ? today the people can use country roads again , people can go on vacation .
the number of kidnappings has fallen sharply .
while the problems of the farc remain , the situation in colombia has improved considerably in the last five years . what are the root causes of the problems in colombia ? from the beginning , and still today , there exists in colombia enormous injustice and a continuously growing gap between rich and poor .
the farc uses the social inequality as a pretext for its power interests .
the farc wants to seize political power in the name of the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent rescue deal failed i do n't see a clear political project anymore behind the farc .
i see only propaganda and a survival by means of money that comes from the drug trade , extortion and other sources .
the majority of colombians do n't want to eliminate injustice with violence . what would you say to people who are currently being held hostage ? i would say that they must do everything possible to persevere .
they must do everything possible to keep busy , even if it 's by playing simple games .
they must read , if it 's possible .
they must keep their minds intact .
that is the only advice i can give the hostages . after returning from colombia you started an internet site with the domain farc.de.
what do you hope to accomplish ? on that site there 's information , notices and news , in german , that deal with the problem of the kidnapping industry .
we want to make a small contribution with it here in the german speaking world .
we want to prevent the erroneous belief that the farc is a liberation movement fighting against a dictator . colombia is a country with great inequalities , but colombia is not a dictatorship .
it is a fairytale and myth to say that they are fighting against a dictatorship . many leftists in europe - less so since green politician ingrid betancourt was kidnapped - believed that the farc was fighting for a just cause in a country ruled by oppression .
we want to inform the public about the real situation in colombia in which the farc are kidnappers and the country , for all its faults , is democratic . interview : josé ospina-valencia -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one would-be volunteer was surprised to have the principle applied to her breasts . while the bundeswehr does n't have any regulations on the books prohibiting its buffed-up troops from pumping up their biceps , a 23-year-old german woman found out that - surprisingly to some - the army is n't interested in big breasts . at least not in artificially large ones . " i still ca n't believe that my silicon breasts are going to destroy my dream , " the woman told the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , dec .
3 .
" i could cry . " " i wanted to be a paramedic , " she added .
" to save lives . " identified only as alessija , the woman said she had hoped to sign a 12-year contract with the armed forces but was classified as " not usable " because of the pair of 250 milliliter -lrb- 8.5 fluid ounce -rrb- implants . what kind of risk ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher-ups do n't like big breasts - but what about the rank-and-file troops ?
a bundeswehr official did not say if the military was concerned the woman would shoot her - or a fellow soldier 's - eye out . " the abstract risk of injury is too large of a responsibility to bear , " the paper quoted marion krauskopf , head of berlin district draft board . the army added that the health regulations currently prohibit people with implants from joining the military are being re-examined , leaving alessija with a chance of fulfilling her dream . " the rule is no longer contemporary , " harald kammerbauer , a defense ministry spokesman , told the bild .
" in the future there will be a case-by-case analysis .
the lady should apply again . " there has , however , been no word on whether implants could help german men avert mandatory military service . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

almost 150 of the uk 's most knowledgeable and influential music critics , editors and broadcasters picked their favourite new acts in the poll .
adele takes us on a tour of her favourite pub in person , adele adkins is not too different from many other 19-year-olds .
she raves about her love of celebrity magazines and boys , smokes and drinks with gusto and relishes being a drama queen .
she willingly talks of herself as gobby , speaks with a loose cockney accent and her conversations are punctuated by eruptions of laughter .
but when she gets on stage or into the studio , she reveals why she has been tipped as the outstanding new musical talent for 2008 .
the first thing that ensnares listeners is the piercingly poignant singing voice , dripping with soul , which goes on jazzy excursions as it swings between being sultry and joyful .
and in her songwriting , her youthful and wide-eyed lyrics are conveyed through tunes that show musical maturity .
adele went to the same performing arts school as amy winehouse adele - she is known by her first name - namechecks everyone from jill scott and eva cassidy to the spice girls and east 17 as influences .
but the pivotal moment in her development came when she was 13 or 14 , when she tried to impress her friends by buying etta james and ella fitzgerald cds .
she did not get round to listening to them for another year , at which point she started trying to copy their styles .
" i really , really loved it , " she says .
" it was simply by singing along to them that i learnt i could sing . "
' i like love ' she enrolled at the brit performing arts school , whose graduates include amy winehouse , katie melua , leona lewis and kate nash .
" i was there at the same time as kate and hugh from the kooks , " adele says .
" but i 'm not best mates with neither of them or nothing . "
it 's always about love or hate , really , and if i 'm not in either i have to create it adele on her songwriting around that time , adele started writing her own songs and honing her own soulful sound .
" i love the timeless singers , i like voices , and i do n't think it 's all about the voice with guitar music and electro music and rock music . "
when asked what inspires her to write , she immediately responds : " love , i like love .
" i like drama .
i like causing drama as well .
it 's always about love or hate , really , and if i 'm not in either i have to create it . "
she had lots of drama last year , she says with relish .
" not bad drama - just every other drama that everyone else has .
rubbish boyfriends and stopping talking to your mates and stuff .
adele 's debut album , 19 , is released in the uk in january " but i create a lot of it as well , and i exaggerate a lot of it sometimes and annoy them so they 're even meaner to me .
i do it on purpose sometimes .
i create my own drama . "
her debut single hometown glory was written as a paean to london after her mother tried to persuade her to move to liverpool to university .
' scandalous ' there is now much anticipation for her debut album , 19 , which is out in the uk at the end of january .
" i 'm not really feeling very pressurised , i thought i would , " adele says .
" i 'm really excited , i hope it 's always about the music and i hope i do n't become scandalous and it takes me like an hour to get out my front door .
i 'm obsessed with celebrity - i just do n't want to be one adele " i hope i always enjoy it , and i think i will .
i 'm having a laugh . "
the singer admits she is " obsessed " with reading about scandalous celebrities , but she does not want to be one herself .
" i love heat magazine .
i love these magazines because they look like rubbish , some of these people who you think are untouchable .
" so you feel really good when you look at them , and i like seeing what they get up to when they ai n't working .
" i just do n't want that to ever happen to me . "
and what if it did ?
" if it ever got to the point where i could n't do anything , i 'd quit , " she declares .
" music 's wicked and i love doing it and i have a laugh , but my life 's more important to me than my music .
so i 'd leave until everyone had forgotten about me . "
is that a serious threat or just more dramatics ?
fans will hope they never have to find out .

almost 150 of the uk 's most knowledgeable and influential music critics , editors and broadcasters picked their favourite new acts in the poll .
adele takes us on a tour of her favourite pub in person , adele adkins is not too different from many other 19-year-olds .
she raves about her love of celebrity magazines and boys , smokes and drinks with gusto and relishes being a drama queen .
she willingly talks of herself as gobby , speaks with a loose cockney accent and her conversations are punctuated by eruptions of laughter .
but when she gets on stage or into the studio , she reveals why she has been tipped as the outstanding new musical talent for 2008 .
the first thing that ensnares listeners is the piercingly poignant singing voice , dripping with soul , which goes on jazzy excursions as it swings between being sultry and joyful .
and in her songwriting , her youthful and wide-eyed lyrics are conveyed through tunes that show musical maturity .
adele went to the same performing arts school as amy winehouse adele - she is known by her first name - namechecks everyone from jill scott and eva cassidy to the spice girls and east 17 as influences .
but the pivotal moment in her development came when she was 13 or 14 , when she tried to impress her friends by buying etta james and ella fitzgerald cds .
she did not get round to listening to them for another year , at which point she started trying to copy their styles .
" i really , really loved it , " she says .
" it was simply by singing along to them that i learnt i could sing . "
' i like love ' she enrolled at the brit performing arts school , whose graduates include amy winehouse , katie melua , leona lewis and kate nash .
" i was there at the same time as kate and hugh from the kooks , " adele says .
" but i 'm not best mates with neither of them or nothing . "
it 's always about love or hate , really , and if i 'm not in either i have to create it adele on her songwriting around that time , adele started writing her own songs and honing her own soulful sound .
" i love the timeless singers , i like voices , and i do n't think it 's all about the voice with guitar music and electro music and rock music . "
when asked what inspires her to write , she immediately responds : " love , i like love .
" i like drama .
i like causing drama as well .
it 's always about love or hate , really , and if i 'm not in either i have to create it . "
she had lots of drama last year , she says with relish .
" not bad drama - just every other drama that everyone else has .
rubbish boyfriends and stopping talking to your mates and stuff .
adele 's debut album , 19 , is released in the uk in january " but i create a lot of it as well , and i exaggerate a lot of it sometimes and annoy them so they 're even meaner to me .
i do it on purpose sometimes .
i create my own drama . "
her debut single hometown glory was written as a paean to london after her mother tried to persuade her to move to liverpool to university .
' scandalous ' there is now much anticipation for her debut album , 19 , which is out in the uk at the end of january .
" i 'm not really feeling very pressurised , i thought i would , " adele says .
" i 'm really excited , i hope it 's always about the music and i hope i do n't become scandalous and it takes me like an hour to get out my front door .
i 'm obsessed with celebrity - i just do n't want to be one adele " i hope i always enjoy it , and i think i will .
i 'm having a laugh . "
the singer admits she is " obsessed " with reading about scandalous celebrities , but she does not want to be one herself .
" i love heat magazine .
i love these magazines because they look like rubbish , some of these people who you think are untouchable .
" so you feel really good when you look at them , and i like seeing what they get up to when they ai n't working .
" i just do n't want that to ever happen to me . "
and what if it did ?
" if it ever got to the point where i could n't do anything , i 'd quit , " she declares .
" music 's wicked and i love doing it and i have a laugh , but my life 's more important to me than my music .
so i 'd leave until everyone had forgotten about me . "
is that a serious threat or just more dramatics ?
fans will hope they never have to find out .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- sound of 2008 : adele bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture friday , 4 january 2008 , 07:02 gmt sound of 2008 : adele by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news nineteen-year-old singer-songwriter adele has come top of the bbc 's sound of 2008 poll , which showcases the best new music talent for the new year .
almost 150 of the uk 's most knowledgeable and influential music critics , editors and broadcasters picked their favourite new acts in the poll .
in person , adele adkins is not too different from many other 19-year-olds .
she raves about her love of celebrity magazines and boys , smokes and drinks with gusto and relishes being a drama queen .
she willingly talks of herself as gobby , speaks with a loose cockney accent and her conversations are punctuated by eruptions of laughter .
but when she gets on stage or into the studio , she reveals why she has been tipped as the outstanding new musical talent for 2008 .
the first thing that ensnares listeners is the piercingly poignant singing voice , dripping with soul , which goes on jazzy excursions as it swings between being sultry and joyful .
and in her songwriting , her youthful and wide-eyed lyrics are conveyed through tunes that show musical maturity .
adele - she is known by her first name - namechecks everyone from jill scott and eva cassidy to the spice girls and east 17 as influences .
but the pivotal moment in her development came when she was 13 or 14 , when she tried to impress her friends by buying etta james and ella fitzgerald cds .
she did not get round to listening to them for another year , at which point she started trying to copy their styles .
" i really , really loved it , " she says .
" it was simply by singing along to them that i learnt i could sing . "
' i like love ' she enrolled at the brit performing arts school , whose graduates include amy winehouse , katie melua , leona lewis and kate nash .
" i was there at the same time as kate and hugh from the kooks , " adele says .
" but i 'm not best mates with neither of them or nothing . "
" it 's always about love or hate , really , and if i 'm not in either i have to create it " adele on her songwriting around that time , adele started writing her own songs and honing her own soulful sound .
" i love the timeless singers , i like voices , and i do n't think it 's all about the voice with guitar music and electro music and rock music . "
when asked what inspires her to write , she immediately responds : " love , i like love .
" i like drama .
i like causing drama as well .
it 's always about love or hate , really , and if i 'm not in either i have to create it . "
she had lots of drama last year , she says with relish .
" not bad drama - just every other drama that everyone else has .
rubbish boyfriends and stopping talking to your mates and stuff .
" but i create a lot of it as well , and i exaggerate a lot of it sometimes and annoy them so they 're even meaner to me .
i do it on purpose sometimes .
i create my own drama . "
her debut single hometown glory was written as a paean to london after her mother tried to persuade her to move to liverpool to university .
' scandalous ' there is now much anticipation for her debut album , 19 , which is out in the uk at the end of january .
" i 'm not really feeling very pressurised , i thought i would , " adele says .
" i 'm really excited , i hope it 's always about the music and i hope i do n't become scandalous and it takes me like an hour to get out my front door . "
i 'm obsessed with celebrity - i just do n't want to be one " adele " i hope i always enjoy it , and i think i will .
i 'm having a laugh . "
the singer admits she is " obsessed " with reading about scandalous celebrities , but she does not want to be one herself .
" i love heat magazine .
i love these magazines because they look like rubbish , some of these people who you think are untouchable .
" so you feel really good when you look at them , and i like seeing what they get up to when they ai n't working .
" i just do n't want that to ever happen to me . "
and what if it did ?
" if it ever got to the point where i could n't do anything , i 'd quit , " she declares .
" music 's wicked and i love doing it and i have a laugh , but my life 's more important to me than my music .
so i 'd leave until everyone had forgotten about me . "
is that a serious threat or just more dramatics ?
fans will hope they never have to find out .

the latest in gadgets and home electronics will be on display , as technology firms hope to ride out a global economic slowdown .
" the industry has to brace itself , " admitted gary shapiro , president of the us consumer electronics association .
microsoft boss bill gates opens the show with a speech on sunday , which will focus on social technologies .
" my feeling is that the us is in for tough times , " said mr shapiro .
' technology tourists ' but he said that economic slowdown and the widespread credit crunch could see people investing more in their homes , rather than buying new property .
" if we were -lsb- an -rsb- industry selling boats or travel , i 'd be concerned .
in terms of consumer electronics the industry is fairly well positioned . "
from the dot.life blog with more than 2,000 exhibiting firms and 140,000 attendees it is more of a brawl than a leisurely trawl through technology darren waters , technology editor , bbc news website read more blog entries he said the weak dollar had helped the us market , with many " technology tourists " visiting the country to buy electronics .
" people are coming to the us because it is such a bargain . "
ces is the focus point for many technologies due to hit shops in the coming 12 months , such as oled tvs , offering brighter , thinner displays , and a plethora of digital living room technologies , such as set-top boxes and digital storage devices .
the show will also be used as a promotion tool for competing technologies such as blu-ray and hd-dvd , and wireless technologies like bluetooth and wireless usb .
mr shaprio said : " ces is truly a convergence show .
we have the devices , the pipes to those devices , and the content and services .
' converging electronics ' " calling it the consumer electronics show is probably a misnomer .
it should be called the converging electronics show , or consumer entertainment show . "
last year the event was overshadowed by an apple event in san francisco , at which steve jobs unveiled the iphone .
every big company starts small .
even microsoft started out as a tiny company at a trade show gary shapiro , cea " it was a little bit challenging for us , " said mr shapiro .
" we handled it and survived . "
the show remains a business event , not just for promotion but also for buyers and distributors .
jeremy fennell , international buying director for pc world , said : " we 'll be looking at the further development of the convergence between the consumer electronics and the it industries .
" we 're looking for products that will help people share information both inside and outside the home . "
' simple devices ' he said the key questions that he hoped ces would answer would be about convergence .
" we want to know : is it going to be one box or more boxes ?
will we see data streaming through multiple pcs - or one digital server sending content to other devices through the home . "
he added : " what i need is simple devices that allow simple movement of my content around the home .
" it is a show where anyone with an idea can sell it to the world , " said mr shapiro .

the figure is up from 3.4 % last month , said incomes data services -lrb- ids -rrb- .
ids said the jump had been triggered by retail price inflation -lrb- rpi -rrb- rising to 4.3 % in november from 4.2 % in october .
the rpi figure is used as the basis for many pay deals , despite it being higher than the government 's preferred consumer price index measure .
inflation as measured by the consumer price index was unchanged at 2.1 % in november - the most recent available data - just above the government 's 2 % target .
price pressures " while the jury is still out on the extent to which the credit crunch in finance will affect the rest of the economy , our initial look at january deals confirms the continued influence of high inflation on pay negotiations in the private sector , " said ken mulkearn , editor of the ids pay report .
" in 2006 the treasury argued that inflation increases were caused by ' temporary factors ' , however average inflation for 2007 stands at 4.3 % overall . "
the ids added that pay rises for the whole of 2007 averaged 3.5 % .
its latest survey covered 30 annual pay deals involving more than 430,000 employees .
inflation has been lifted primarily by higher energy and food bills .
in november the price of a litre of unleaded petrol broke through £ 1 for the first time , and a month earlier the annual rate of food inflation hit a 14-year high .
the higher pay deals in the private sector may increase the pressure on the government to be more generous with pay rises in the public sector .

the figure is up from 3.4 % last month , said incomes data services -lrb- ids -rrb- .
ids said the jump had been triggered by retail price inflation -lrb- rpi -rrb- rising to 4.3 % in november from 4.2 % in october .
the rpi figure is used as the basis for many pay deals , despite it being higher than the government 's preferred consumer price index measure .
inflation as measured by the consumer price index was unchanged at 2.1 % in november - the most recent available data - just above the government 's 2 % target .
price pressures " while the jury is still out on the extent to which the credit crunch in finance will affect the rest of the economy , our initial look at january deals confirms the continued influence of high inflation on pay negotiations in the private sector , " said ken mulkearn , editor of the ids pay report .
" in 2006 the treasury argued that inflation increases were caused by ' temporary factors ' , however average inflation for 2007 stands at 4.3 % overall . "
the ids added that pay rises for the whole of 2007 averaged 3.5 % .
its latest survey covered 30 annual pay deals involving more than 430,000 employees .
inflation has been lifted primarily by higher energy and food bills .
in november the price of a litre of unleaded petrol broke through £ 1 for the first time , and a month earlier the annual rate of food inflation hit a 14-year high .
the higher pay deals in the private sector may increase the pressure on the government to be more generous with pay rises in the public sector .

" while officers were at britney 's home they found that britney appeared under the influence of an unknown substance , " officer jason lee told the bbc .
" she is being taken into custody for evaluation , " he added .
the 26-year-old singer and ex-husband kevin federline are wrangling over custody of their two young sons .
' breakdown ' police were called to spears ' home at 2000 local time -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- over a family custodial dispute that they tried to resolve " peacefully by court order " , mr lee said .
after nearly three hours , spears reportedly handed over her children , two-year-old sean preston and one-year-old jayden james , to federline .
federline has temporary custody of their children because spears , who has limited visitation rights , failed to comply with court orders .
the pop star 's lawyers filed a court motion earlier this week asking to be relieved as her representatives due to a " breakdown " in communication .
spears and federline were married in september 2004 and divorced in july 2007 .
