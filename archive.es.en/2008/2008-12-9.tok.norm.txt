but germany , europe 's largest economy , was n't represented . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy insisted at their meeting on monday , dec .
8 , that europe was united on the need for further action to stimulate the global economy . the two leaders , who were joined in talks in london by european commission president jose manuel barroso , dismissed media reports of differences with germany on the need of further urgent measures , including tax cuts . brown , sarkozy and barroso said they had spoken to german chancellor angela merkel on the eve of the london meeting and insisted that there was " no disagreement " on the need for a harmonized approach to the unprecedented crisis . eu praises german contribution " i have full confidence in the efforts that germany is making and will make , " said barroso .
" germany is the most important european economy , and so it would be completely unreasonable to think about any plan without the active cooperation of germany . " merkel has recently been criticized both at home and abroad for what some have called an isolationist approach to the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's popularity has suffered under the financial crisis though germany has passed a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- national stimulus package , the german chancellor has come under fire , in particular , for her reluctance to embrace a joint eu approach . on monday , sarkozy defended germany 's path .
he stressed that its bailout plan was " as significant " as the measures taken by france and that the fact that countries did not use the " same tools " to stimulate their economies did not mean that they disagreed . steinmeier irked by merkel 's absence german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said he regretted merkel 's absence . " i 'll be honest .
i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he told germany 's public broadcaster zdf . steinmeier also said germany 's role in tackling the financial crisis was respected throughout europe , despite criticism from the press . " i 've been in a lot of european capitals and what you hear is different than what you see in the newspapers , " he said .
" what germany is doing is being closely watched .
but i ca n't see that other countries are doing more than we 're doing in germany . " more cooperation , less protectionism barroso insisted that the eu was " in the vanguard " of providing the right responses to the global downturn and urged a " strong level of coordination . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's proposed stimulus package involves environmental measures in an eu of 27 nations , there could not be a " one-size-fits-all solution " to problems as fundamental as the current global crisis , he said . brown urged europe to follow the united states ' example and increase the level of infrastructure investment in response to the economic crisis . " we need to invest in a digital , low-carbon , environmentally-friendly europe of the 21st century , " said brown .
investment now in technology , construction and public works infrastructure would ensure that the " downturn is followed by an upturn , " he added . brown also said that a protectionist approach would " delay any recovery " and only deepen the current crisis . monday 's meeting in london preceded a two-day eu summit in brussels , beginning on thursday , where both the economy and climate change are to top the agenda . barroso has proposed a 200-billion-euro bloc wide stimulus plan , which would include spending on low-carbon public transport , high-speed internet connections and improvements to energy infrastructure . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is taking over a un security mission in kosovo , but is relunctant to commit troops in dr congo . the former breakaway province of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from serbia in february , will go from being a ward of the united nations to being under the auspices of a new european union-led mission on tuesday , dec .
9 . charged with overseeing the reform of the criminal justice system , the eu is expected to take urgent measures to resolve kosovo 's backlog of war crimes . " ten years after the end of the war in kosovo , the eu-led mission should ensure that the relatives of more than 3,000 disappeared and abducted people are told the truth about the fate of their loved ones and the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice , " said nicola duckworth , head of amnesty international 's europe program . under the eu plan , some 2,000 of the mission 's eulex police force will take over un responsibilities in kosovo .
eulex would operate " all over kosovo , " including the serb-controlled areas , according to a police spokeswoman . eu takes over from a strapped un short on troops and cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu takes over un mission in kosovo on tuesday the deployment plan comes at a time when un peacekeeping is headed towards a crisis with the demand for troops around the world 's hot spots skyrocketing .
furthermore un officials say that the annual budget is insufficient to cover the cost of current commitments in the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic as well as somalia , where the eu has just launched an anti-piracy mission . un peacekeepers may find it hard over the next few years to finance missions as member states feel the heat from the global financial crisis , fabienne hara , vice-president of the international crisis group , a brussels-based think-tank , told reuters news agency . " contributions will probably not grow at the very least , if not diminish , " she said , adding that some missions " may not funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources . " most of the 112,000 un troops stationed across the globe come from developing countries like india and pakistan , with rich western nations footing the bill for their deployment .
the united states for instance pays for 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget , but along with europe is facing a recession triggered by the international financial crisis . no eu soldiers to spare for dr congo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un called for an interim eu " bridging force " for dr congo eu states such as germany , which favor diplomatic rather than military solutions to conflict areas , complain that iraq and expanding commitments in afghanistan mean that they have no soldiers to spare for other un missions , such as the dr congo . over the weekend united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon called for an eu " bridging force , " saying it may take up to six months for the un to deploy 3,000 more peacekeepers to congo to boost its 17,000-strong monuc force .
the eu has a reserve contingent of combat troops , which could be deployed on short notice . the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday , but the bloc has been extremely reluctant to commit troops in the dr congo , a former belgian colony where some 250,000 civilians have been displaced by the violent clashes between pro-government militias and renegade tutsi rebels . belgian foreign minister karel de gucht did however say before the meeting monday that there was an urgent need for a bridging mission of 2,500 to 3,000 troops . " it will take four to six months before the additional troops for monuc will arrive and the humanitarian situation is dramatic over there , " de gucht told reporters . britain 's foreign secretary david miliband also told reporters that beefing up the un forces was a priority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups slam eu for not doing more to aid refugees " our position has always been that there is … a un commitment to increase the size of the monuc foce , so the first port of call is for countries to see whether they can add , either at a planning or operational level to that monuc force , " said miliband . aid groups criticize eu for not doing more the un has characterized the fighting in the dr congo as catastrophic and humanitarian aid groups have slammed the eu 's failure to deploy troops . " we have had a month of every possible excuse as to why europe will not send forces to bolster un peacekeepers , " said elise ford , head of oxfam international in brussels in an interview with the bbc . " without an adequate professional force supporting un peacekeepers to provide a measure of security for the population , the killing , raping and looting will continue unabated , " she added .
" we can not stand by and watch . " one senior un security council diplomat from a european country said such criticism was valid , but added that it was time for other countries with large , well-trained armies to offer soldiers to the dr congo and other missions in need of troops . " we 're not the only ones who can do this , " the diplomat said .

investigators said the botched bombing could have ended in a bloodbath .

9 , convicted the 24-year-old lebanese youssef al-hajj dib of planting bombs on two trains in germany that would have caused mass carnage if they had exploded . he was sentenced to life imprisonment for multiple attempted murders .
his accomplice , jihad hamad , was convicted at a separate trial in lebanon and is serving a 12-year prison term in beirut . german authorities said dib was a hardened islamic extremist who was trying to kill as many people as possible in revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases contained gas cannisters primed to explode men identified by police as dib and hamad were captured on security cameras placing suitcases packed with homemade explosives on two trains carrying 280 people on july 31 , 2006 . the images ran in heavy rotation on national television as the country digested how close it may have come to the first islamist attack on german soil since the anti-us suicide hijackings of sept .
11 , 2001 , which were planned in part in the german port city of hamburg . " germany was never closer to an islamist attack , " state prosecutor duscha gmel said . prosecutors argue that the explosions could have killed up to 75 people , saying only a technical fault prevented a massacre in a plot allegedly modeled on the deadly train blasts in madrid in 2004 and london in 2005 . accused tells of plan to scare not murder the defendant told the regional superior court in this western city on dec .
2 at the end of his year-long trial that he had never planned to murder anyone but had aimed to frighten the german public over the mohammed cartoons . " i swear by god almighty that it was never my intention to kill , " he said in a final statement to the court , adding that he knew " there would be no explosion " when he left the device on the train . he said hamad , who is serving a 12-year sentence in beirut over the case , was lying when he told lebanese investigators that the two had plotted mass murder . " it is because he was tortured , " dib asserted . would-be bombers fled to lebanon both men had lived as students in germany .
after putting the suitcases on the trains , they each disembarked at the next station and flew from cologne to istanbul and then lebanon , where hamad was captured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad hamad is serving 12 years in lebanon dib was arrested after he returned to germany days later . his defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz told the court that his client had made a conscious decision not to include oxygen in gas canisters used in the homemade bombs - the missing ingredient necessary for an explosion . " the aim was to frighten people with a mock-up , " he said ahead of the verdict . presiding judge ottmar breidling expressed doubts about this version of events in a hearing in late october , noting that dummy explosives would have no need for detonators , as were found in the suitcases on the trains . a " foothold " in religious extremism dib is the youngest of 13 children .
two of his brothers were killed combat in the middle east , while two others are being held in lebanese prisons on suspicion of terror . due to his limited knowledge of german , dib 's university applications in germany were repeatedly turned down .
court psychologists said he likely turned to islamic extremism because he could not live up to his parents ' expectations .
they had apparently hoped he would return to lebanon with an engineering degree . after his rough start in germany , dib found a " foothold in religion , " he 'd told the court . dw staff -lrb- sms / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce .

officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .

both want more flexibility . the one-day meeting came ahead of an eu climate change summit on december 11-12 , at which the bloc hopes to institute a system by 2013 to auction off permits for the right to emit carbon dioxide .
poland , which is heavily dependent on coal , has expressed serious reservations about the proposal as well as the bloc 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by twenty percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 .
it had even hinted at the possibility of vetoing such a deal , which it says would favor more established eu member states over newer ones .
merkel , who has vowed to resist any eu climate measures that would cut german jobs , said that she and her polish counterpart were basically on the same page on this issue .
" we have made a great step forward , " merkel told journalists after the meeting .
" the possibility of a veto has become smaller . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of eastern europe requires coal to meet its power needs tusk concurred with that assessment .
" neither poland nor germany are interested in a veto , " the polish prime minister said .
" we want to work out a package which will take into consideration everyone 's concerns . "
perhaps with an eye toward france , which is hoping to pass the agreement unanimously , merkel said that eu member states needed to understand one another 's needs .
" poland wants to push back the auctioning process and that is understandable , given that poland has a long way to go before replacing its coal-fired power plants , " she said .
" but obviously we need to talk about the details here . "
those talks will be held in brussels later this week .
but with many eu members worried about climate change , there 's no guarantee the tone will be as amicable as at the merkel and tusk 's meeting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .
a coroner 's report shows the boy was shot in the chest .

around 2,000 protesters , led by the olme teachers ' union , marched on parliament carrying a large banner reading " assassins , the government is the culprit " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rioting has already caused widespread damage greece braced for more widespread protests and possible violence following the funeral .
the shooting was seen as the last straw by many young greeks whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment rate and low wages .
unemployment is pegged at over 7 per cent and nearly 20 per cent of greeks live below the poverty line , earning less than 600 euros -lrb- $ 775 -rrb- a month .
" everyone appears to have let our children down .

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .
a coroner 's report shows the boy was shot in the chest .

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .
a coroner 's report shows the boy was shot in the chest .
teachers lead mass demonstration against government schools and universities across the country closed their doors for three days and hundreds of teachers , university lecturers and students rallied in central athens .
around 2,000 protesters , led by the olme teachers ' union , marched on parliament carrying a large banner reading " assassins , the government is the culprit " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rioting has already caused widespread damage greece braced for more widespread protests and possible violence following the funeral .
the shooting was seen as the last straw by many young greeks whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment rate and low wages .
unemployment is pegged at over 7 per cent and nearly 20 per cent of greeks live below the poverty line , earning less than 600 euros -lrb- $ 775 -rrb- a month .
" everyone appears to have let our children down .
students have become more hostile towards us and to figures of authority , " said christos kittas , after resigning as the dean of athens university after rioting spread to campuses .
rioting , political pressure could bring down government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity measures of the government are unpopular public unrest has grown with the conservative government 's austerity measures , with unions regularly demonstrating against privatizations , pension reforms and the cost of living , and this latest incident could topple the unpopular conservative government .
the main opposition socialist party leader george papandreou called on the government to resign in an effort to end the crisis .
" the government has lost public confidence , " papandreou told pasok socialist party deputies .
" the only thing it can give this country is to depart ... to seek a public verdict so that the people can give a solution . "
three successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted across greece and left many athenians angry about the response of the government and police to the riots and their inability to stop the destruction .
within hours of the shooting , riots erupted throughout greece , starting from the capital athens and quickly spreading to the northern port city of thessaloniki , volos , thessalia and to the holiday islands of corfu and crete .
almost every city across the country saw cars , buildings , banks and shops torched , looted or smashed .
greek leaders ' calls for calm go unheeded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis vowed to crack down on the rioters greece 's president appealed for calm and prime minister costas karamanlis vowed to crack down on the unrest , but protesters again defied the government and there was new unrest in athens and other cities .
karamanlis called a crisis cabinet meeting on monday night and held new meetings with president karolos papoulias and leaders of allied and opposition political parties on tuesday .
" we will tolerate no leniency in the attribution of responsibility , " the prime minister said after talks with the president .
papoulias meanwhile appealed for calm , calling on greeks to " honor alexis ' memory peacefully . "
the government , already in trouble over the state of the economy and a series of political scandals , has been strongly criticized over the havoc .
" the whole country was delivered to chaos by an irresponsible government , " the eleftherotypia daily said in an editorial tuesday .
the violence has showcased the organizational capacity of urban radicals and the failure of the government to crack down , critics said .
public anger aimed at " outlaw " police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the greek police act like they 're above the law many of the protesters say that the killing of grigoropoulos was the latest example of police acting as if they were above the law .
" this is not just a random incident , " said magda , a 27-year-old hotel worker who was participating in a leftwing demonstration in athens .
" it has to do with the role played by the security forces ... who enjoy impunity . "
lawyer dimitris beladis , who specializes in urban troubles , the killing " is the detonator of a sort of social explosion due to economic insecurity that affects many youths and those who are unemployed or badly paid . "
abroad , demonstrators attempted to take over the greek embassies in london and cyprus .
in the german capital berlin , protesters describing themselves as anarchists invaded the greek consulate on monday .
more than 60 people reportedly stormed the greek embassy in paris on tuesday .

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce . " " this proposal , steered by the self-interest of eu member states , sets the bar far too low , " said the coalition , as quoted by afp news agency . opposition from some eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a strong coal tradition in much of europe the eu 's climate package has in recent weeks also come under fire from its member states that depend the most on coal . poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they 've also demanded the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states . in addition , italy has demanded that the climate goals be reviewed half-way , in 2014 , a move some say could threaten investment and jobs in alternative energy sectors . the final climate deal is set to be agreed thursday and friday at the brussels summit . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his accomplice , jihad hamad , was convicted at a separate trial in lebanon and is serving a 12-year prison term in beirut . german authorities said dib was a hardened islamic extremist who was trying to kill as many people as possible in revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases contained gas cannisters primed to explode men identified by police as dib and hamad were captured on security cameras placing suitcases packed with homemade explosives on two trains carrying 280 people on july 31 , 2006 . the images ran in heavy rotation on national television as the country digested how close it may have come to the first islamist attack on german soil since the anti-us suicide hijackings of sept .
11 , 2001 , which were planned in part in the german port city of hamburg . " germany was never closer to an islamist attack , " state prosecutor duscha gmel said . prosecutors argue that the explosions could have killed up to 75 people , saying only a technical fault prevented a massacre in a plot allegedly modeled on the deadly train blasts in madrid in 2004 and london in 2005 . accused tells of plan to scare not murder the defendant told the regional superior court in this western city on dec .

" it is because he was tortured , " dib asserted . would-be bombers fled to lebanon both men had lived as students in germany .

" the aim was to frighten people with a mock-up , " he said ahead of the verdict . presiding judge ottmar breidling expressed doubts about this version of events in a hearing in late october , noting that dummy explosives would have no need for detonators , as were found in the suitcases on the trains . a " foothold " in religious extremism dib is the youngest of 13 children .
two of his brothers were killed combat in the middle east , while two others are being held in lebanese prisons on suspicion of terror . due to his limited knowledge of german , dib 's university applications in germany were repeatedly turned down .
court psychologists said he likely turned to islamic extremism because he could not live up to his parents ' expectations .
they had apparently hoped he would return to lebanon with an engineering degree . after his rough start in germany , dib found a " foothold in religion , " he 'd told the court . dw staff -lrb- sms / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . nearly 600 people have died of the disease since the outbreak began in august and another 300,000 people are particularly susceptible to infection due to lack of food .
the united nations has estimated that nearly 14,000 people have already been infected with the illness . because those figures do not include people who died at home , the real toll is thought to be much higher . the additional grant raises germany 's total aid to zimbabwe this year to nearly 6 million euros . poverty goes hand-in-hand with disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those weakened by a lack of food are more susceptible to cholera the funds are to be spent on rehydration fluids , infusion packs , antibiotics and protective clothing for staff treating cholera patients .
the red cross is also to repair hand-powered water pumps to give more people access to clean drinking water . the country 's water supply network has failed and widespread water contamination has allowed the disease to spread rapidly .
in addition , over half of the population of 12 million is in need of food aid , which makes them more vulnerable to the illness . though children are most susceptible , the cholera outbreak has left many orphans .
zimbabwe already has the highest rate of orphaned children in the world .
it is estimated that over one million children have lost one or both parents to hiv / aids , poverty-related diseases , or - more recently - cholera . more international pressure on mugabe also on monday , european leaders including french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , called for zimbabwe 's long-time leader robert mugabe to step down . " the time has come to put all the pressure on mugabe to step down and give the opportunity once again to the people of zimbabwe to put their lives together , " solana told reporters monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has held power in for 21 years mugabe 's government has accused western governments of using the epidemic as a reason for intervention by the un security council in zimbabwe . " they are dead set on ensuring that there is an invasion of zimbabwe , " said george charamba , mugabe 's chief spokesman . the epidemic has been caused by the collapse of water and sanitation services in urban areas , as evidenced by the raw effluent flowing out of people 's drains , and piles of uncollected garbage . mugabe , who has been in a political deadlock with opposition leader morgan tsvangirai over a power-sharing agreement , has been blamed for current crisis .
meanwhile , the country 's once strong economy continues to plummet , with basic food supplies running out and prices doubling every 24 hours . mugabe , however , has accused the west of taking advantage of his country 's crisis to have him ousted . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is taking over a un security mission in kosovo , but is relunctant to commit troops in dr congo . the former breakaway province of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from serbia in february , will go from being a ward of the united nations to being under the auspices of a new european union-led mission on tuesday , dec .
9 . charged with overseeing the reform of the criminal justice system , the eu is expected to take urgent measures to resolve kosovo 's backlog of war crimes . " ten years after the end of the war in kosovo , the eu-led mission should ensure that the relatives of more than 3,000 disappeared and abducted people are told the truth about the fate of their loved ones and the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice , " said nicola duckworth , head of amnesty international 's europe program . under the eu plan , some 2,000 of the mission 's eulex police force will take over un responsibilities in kosovo .
eulex would operate " all over kosovo , " including the serb-controlled areas , according to a police spokeswoman . eu takes over from a strapped un short on troops and cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu takes over un mission in kosovo on tuesday the deployment plan comes at a time when un peacekeeping is headed towards a crisis with the demand for troops around the world 's hot spots skyrocketing .
furthermore un officials say that the annual budget is insufficient to cover the cost of current commitments in the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic as well as somalia , where the eu has just launched an anti-piracy mission . un peacekeepers may find it hard over the next few years to finance missions as member states feel the heat from the global financial crisis , fabienne hara , vice-president of the international crisis group , a brussels-based think-tank , told reuters news agency .

" ten years after the end of the war in kosovo , the eu-led mission should ensure that the relatives of more than 3,000 disappeared and abducted people are told the truth about the fate of their loved ones and the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice , " said nicola duckworth , head of amnesty international 's europe program . under the eu plan , some 2,000 of the mission 's eulex police force will take over un responsibilities in kosovo .
eulex would operate " all over kosovo , " including the serb-controlled areas , according to a police spokeswoman . eu takes over from a strapped un short on troops and cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu takes over un mission in kosovo on tuesday the deployment plan comes at a time when un peacekeeping is headed towards a crisis with the demand for troops around the world 's hot spots skyrocketing .
furthermore un officials say that the annual budget is insufficient to cover the cost of current commitments in the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic as well as somalia , where the eu has just launched an anti-piracy mission . un peacekeepers may find it hard over the next few years to finance missions as member states feel the heat from the global financial crisis , fabienne hara , vice-president of the international crisis group , a brussels-based think-tank , told reuters news agency . " contributions will probably not grow at the very least , if not diminish , " she said , adding that some missions " may not funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources . " most of the 112,000 un troops stationed across the globe come from developing countries like india and pakistan , with rich western nations footing the bill for their deployment .
the united states for instance pays for 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget , but along with europe is facing a recession triggered by the international financial crisis . no eu soldiers to spare for dr congo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un called for an interim eu " bridging force " for dr congo eu states such as germany , which favor diplomatic rather than military solutions to conflict areas , complain that iraq and expanding commitments in afghanistan mean that they have no soldiers to spare for other un missions , such as the dr congo . over the weekend united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon called for an eu " bridging force , " saying it may take up to six months for the un to deploy 3,000 more peacekeepers to congo to boost its 17,000-strong monuc force .
the eu has a reserve contingent of combat troops , which could be deployed on short notice . the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday , but the bloc has been extremely reluctant to commit troops in the dr congo , a former belgian colony where some 250,000 civilians have been displaced by the violent clashes between pro-government militias and renegade tutsi rebels . belgian foreign minister karel de gucht did however say before the meeting monday that there was an urgent need for a bridging mission of 2,500 to 3,000 troops . " it will take four to six months before the additional troops for monuc will arrive and the humanitarian situation is dramatic over there , " de gucht told reporters . britain 's foreign secretary david miliband also told reporters that beefing up the un forces was a priority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups slam eu for not doing more to aid refugees " our position has always been that there is … a un commitment to increase the size of the monuc foce , so the first port of call is for countries to see whether they can add , either at a planning or operational level to that monuc force , " said miliband . aid groups criticize eu for not doing more the un has characterized the fighting in the dr congo as catastrophic and humanitarian aid groups have slammed the eu 's failure to deploy troops . " we have had a month of every possible excuse as to why europe will not send forces to bolster un peacekeepers , " said elise ford , head of oxfam international in brussels in an interview with the bbc . " without an adequate professional force supporting un peacekeepers to provide a measure of security for the population , the killing , raping and looting will continue unabated , " she added .
" we can not stand by and watch . " one senior un security council diplomat from a european country said such criticism was valid , but added that it was time for other countries with large , well-trained armies to offer soldiers to the dr congo and other missions in need of troops . " we 're not the only ones who can do this , " the diplomat said .

where are the developing countries who want to have seats on the security council ?

both want more flexibility . the one-day meeting came ahead of an eu climate change summit on december 11-12 , at which the bloc hopes to institute a system by 2013 to auction off permits for the right to emit carbon dioxide .
poland , which is heavily dependent on coal , has expressed serious reservations about the proposal as well as the bloc 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by twenty percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 .
it had even hinted at the possibility of vetoing such a deal , which it says would favor more established eu member states over newer ones .
merkel , who has vowed to resist any eu climate measures that would cut german jobs , said that she and her polish counterpart were basically on the same page on this issue .
" we have made a great step forward , " merkel told journalists after the meeting .
" the possibility of a veto has become smaller . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of eastern europe requires coal to meet its power needs tusk concurred with that assessment .
" neither poland nor germany are interested in a veto , " the polish prime minister said .

perhaps with an eye toward france , which is hoping to pass the agreement unanimously , merkel said that eu member states needed to understand one another 's needs .
" poland wants to push back the auctioning process and that is understandable , given that poland has a long way to go before replacing its coal-fired power plants , " she said .

both want more flexibility . the one-day meeting came ahead of an eu climate change summit on december 11-12 , at which the bloc hopes to institute a system by 2013 to auction off permits for the right to emit carbon dioxide .
poland , which is heavily dependent on coal , has expressed serious reservations about the proposal as well as the bloc 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by twenty percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 .
it had even hinted at the possibility of vetoing such a deal , which it says would favor more established eu member states over newer ones .
merkel , who has vowed to resist any eu climate measures that would cut german jobs , said that she and her polish counterpart were basically on the same page on this issue .
" we have made a great step forward , " merkel told journalists after the meeting .
" the possibility of a veto has become smaller . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of eastern europe requires coal to meet its power needs tusk concurred with that assessment .
" neither poland nor germany are interested in a veto , " the polish prime minister said .
" we want to work out a package which will take into consideration everyone 's concerns . "
perhaps with an eye toward france , which is hoping to pass the agreement unanimously , merkel said that eu member states needed to understand one another 's needs .
" poland wants to push back the auctioning process and that is understandable , given that poland has a long way to go before replacing its coal-fired power plants , " she said .
" but obviously we need to talk about the details here . "

and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brendan fraser plays the lead role earnest beginnings funke started out as a kindergarten teacher and illustrator for children 's books in the german city of hamburg before her writing career took off .
three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .
adult can delight in the complex dialogue and try fiercely to pick out historical figures such as adolf hitler among the plot 's villains .
youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .
one such cg scene shows a desert sandstorm morphing into flesh and blood .
younger children meanwhile can hold their breath , just hoping good will win out over evil .

and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brendan fraser plays the lead role earnest beginnings funke started out as a kindergarten teacher and illustrator for children 's books in the german city of hamburg before her writing career took off .
three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .
adult can delight in the complex dialogue and try fiercely to pick out historical figures such as adolf hitler among the plot 's villains .
youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .
one such cg scene shows a desert sandstorm morphing into flesh and blood .
younger children meanwhile can hold their breath , just hoping good will win out over evil .

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce . " " this proposal , steered by the self-interest of eu member states , sets the bar far too low , " said the coalition , as quoted by afp news agency . opposition from some eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a strong coal tradition in much of europe the eu 's climate package has in recent weeks also come under fire from its member states that depend the most on coal . poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they 've also demanded the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states . in addition , italy has demanded that the climate goals be reviewed half-way , in 2014 , a move some say could threaten investment and jobs in alternative energy sectors . the final climate deal is set to be agreed thursday and friday at the brussels summit . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both want more flexibility . the one-day meeting came ahead of an eu climate change summit on december 11-12 , at which the bloc hopes to institute a system by 2013 to auction off permits for the right to emit carbon dioxide .
poland , which is heavily dependent on coal , has expressed serious reservations about the proposal as well as the bloc 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by twenty percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 .
it had even hinted at the possibility of vetoing such a deal , which it says would favor more established eu member states over newer ones .
merkel , who has vowed to resist any eu climate measures that would cut german jobs , said that she and her polish counterpart were basically on the same page on this issue .

" the possibility of a veto has become smaller . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.12.2008 bremen 's diego to miss four games for strangle attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego later used his hands , and not his head , against karlsruhe a momentary loss of muscular control means werder will be without their playmaker until late february .
with striker claudio pizarro also banned , bremen 's title hopes may be dead and buried . games do n't get much costlier than bremen 's 1-0 defeat at karlsruhe last weekend .
not only did last year 's runners-up drop three points to what was then the worst team in the league but the team 's cool appeared to blow along with its title chances .
the german football federation , the dfb , has now also suspended playmaker diego , the motor of bremen 's offense , for four games after video footage showed him trying to strangle karlsruhe defender christian eichner .
one day before , on december 8 , the dfb banned striker claudio pizarro for three games for slapping karlruhe 's martin stoll in the dying minutes of the match .
bremen and the two players affected say they accept the suspensions - a wise decision considering that the prospects for a successful appeal would be next to none .
still two questions remain .
how did a perennial league powerhouse , which is currently tenth in the league , go so far off the rails ?
and what if anything can bremen do to get back on track ?
rogue electrons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has been the most irate season of schaaf 's tenure werder have astonished fans in recent years by consistently finishing in the top three despite losing key players to wealthier clubs almost every season .
much of the credit has to go to coach thomas schaaf 's finely honed team system .
but this season , key players have lost their heads instead of concentrating on their appointed roles .
in the 6th round , star defender per mertesacker earned a red card and a three-game ban for pulling down an opponent with a clear line to goal in bremen 's match against hoffenheim .
in round 12 , up-and-coming midfielder mesut oezil kicked out at a bochum player , for which he was also sent off and given an involuntarily three-round holiday .
with diego and pizarro now also relegated to the sidelines , much is being written about bremen 's implosion .
but that 's the wrong metaphor .
instead , bremen are suffering from a void at the heart of the team .
veteran midfielder torsten frings has been more concerned about feuding with germany coach joachim loew over his standing in the national squad than about leading bremen .
and daniel jensen , another player who has provided stability , has been out for most of the season with injury .
thus , bremen are more like an unstable atom then a dying star .
the nucleus has lost the pull to make the whole cohere , and the electrons are beginning to spin out of control .
tricky off-season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen could sure use a return to form by sanogo bremen had already said they would try to off-load some of their non-performers , including strikers boubacar sanogo and martin harnik , during the winter break .
but unless they want to write off this season , this long-term strategy may have to be modified to address some pressing needs .
not only will diego and pizarro have to be replaced .
hugo almeida could also now be out for some weeks with an injury so werder have to either buy a forward or rehabilitate one of those they already have .
bremen could also use a couple of stocking stuffers for their porous defense , but bringing in too much new talent could result in a glut , and further damage to team chemistry , when regulars return from injury and suspension .
werder are now eight points adrift of third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league .
with wolfsburg still to play this year , and three more league games to survive before the team is back to full strength , bremen could find itself too far back by march to mount a realistic challenge at the top three .
in any case , it 's going to be a precarious christmas this year for what was once the bundesliga 's most consistent club . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce . " " this proposal , steered by the self-interest of eu member states , sets the bar far too low , " said the coalition , as quoted by afp news agency . opposition from some eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a strong coal tradition in much of europe the eu 's climate package has in recent weeks also come under fire from its member states that depend the most on coal . poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they 've also demanded the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states . in addition , italy has demanded that the climate goals be reviewed half-way , in 2014 , a move some say could threaten investment and jobs in alternative energy sectors . the final climate deal is set to be agreed thursday and friday at the brussels summit . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is taking over a un security mission in kosovo , but is relunctant to commit troops in dr congo . the former breakaway province of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from serbia in february , will go from being a ward of the united nations to being under the auspices of a new european union-led mission on tuesday , dec .
9 . charged with overseeing the reform of the criminal justice system , the eu is expected to take urgent measures to resolve kosovo 's backlog of war crimes . " ten years after the end of the war in kosovo , the eu-led mission should ensure that the relatives of more than 3,000 disappeared and abducted people are told the truth about the fate of their loved ones and the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice , " said nicola duckworth , head of amnesty international 's europe program . under the eu plan , some 2,000 of the mission 's eulex police force will take over un responsibilities in kosovo .
eulex would operate " all over kosovo , " including the serb-controlled areas , according to a police spokeswoman . eu takes over from a strapped un short on troops and cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu takes over un mission in kosovo on tuesday the deployment plan comes at a time when un peacekeeping is headed towards a crisis with the demand for troops around the world 's hot spots skyrocketing .
furthermore un officials say that the annual budget is insufficient to cover the cost of current commitments in the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic as well as somalia , where the eu has just launched an anti-piracy mission . un peacekeepers may find it hard over the next few years to finance missions as member states feel the heat from the global financial crisis , fabienne hara , vice-president of the international crisis group , a brussels-based think-tank , told reuters news agency . " contributions will probably not grow at the very least , if not diminish , " she said , adding that some missions " may not funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources . " most of the 112,000 un troops stationed across the globe come from developing countries like india and pakistan , with rich western nations footing the bill for their deployment .
the united states for instance pays for 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget , but along with europe is facing a recession triggered by the international financial crisis . no eu soldiers to spare for dr congo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un called for an interim eu " bridging force " for dr congo eu states such as germany , which favor diplomatic rather than military solutions to conflict areas , complain that iraq and expanding commitments in afghanistan mean that they have no soldiers to spare for other un missions , such as the dr congo . over the weekend united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon called for an eu " bridging force , " saying it may take up to six months for the un to deploy 3,000 more peacekeepers to congo to boost its 17,000-strong monuc force .
the eu has a reserve contingent of combat troops , which could be deployed on short notice . the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday , but the bloc has been extremely reluctant to commit troops in the dr congo , a former belgian colony where some 250,000 civilians have been displaced by the violent clashes between pro-government militias and renegade tutsi rebels . belgian foreign minister karel de gucht did however say before the meeting monday that there was an urgent need for a bridging mission of 2,500 to 3,000 troops . " it will take four to six months before the additional troops for monuc will arrive and the humanitarian situation is dramatic over there , " de gucht told reporters . britain 's foreign secretary david miliband also told reporters that beefing up the un forces was a priority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups slam eu for not doing more to aid refugees " our position has always been that there is … a un commitment to increase the size of the monuc foce , so the first port of call is for countries to see whether they can add , either at a planning or operational level to that monuc force , " said miliband . aid groups criticize eu for not doing more the un has characterized the fighting in the dr congo as catastrophic and humanitarian aid groups have slammed the eu 's failure to deploy troops . " we have had a month of every possible excuse as to why europe will not send forces to bolster un peacekeepers , " said elise ford , head of oxfam international in brussels in an interview with the bbc . " without an adequate professional force supporting un peacekeepers to provide a measure of security for the population , the killing , raping and looting will continue unabated , " she added .
" we can not stand by and watch . " one senior un security council diplomat from a european country said such criticism was valid , but added that it was time for other countries with large , well-trained armies to offer soldiers to the dr congo and other missions in need of troops . " we 're not the only ones who can do this , " the diplomat said .
" where are the russians , the ukrainians ?
where are the developing countries who want to have seats on the security council ?

the eu is taking over a un security mission in kosovo , but is relunctant to commit troops in dr congo . the former breakaway province of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from serbia in february , will go from being a ward of the united nations to being under the auspices of a new european union-led mission on tuesday , dec .
9 . charged with overseeing the reform of the criminal justice system , the eu is expected to take urgent measures to resolve kosovo 's backlog of war crimes . " ten years after the end of the war in kosovo , the eu-led mission should ensure that the relatives of more than 3,000 disappeared and abducted people are told the truth about the fate of their loved ones and the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice , " said nicola duckworth , head of amnesty international 's europe program . under the eu plan , some 2,000 of the mission 's eulex police force will take over un responsibilities in kosovo .
eulex would operate " all over kosovo , " including the serb-controlled areas , according to a police spokeswoman . eu takes over from a strapped un short on troops and cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu takes over un mission in kosovo on tuesday the deployment plan comes at a time when un peacekeeping is headed towards a crisis with the demand for troops around the world 's hot spots skyrocketing .
furthermore un officials say that the annual budget is insufficient to cover the cost of current commitments in the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic as well as somalia , where the eu has just launched an anti-piracy mission . un peacekeepers may find it hard over the next few years to finance missions as member states feel the heat from the global financial crisis , fabienne hara , vice-president of the international crisis group , a brussels-based think-tank , told reuters news agency . " contributions will probably not grow at the very least , if not diminish , " she said , adding that some missions " may not funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources . " most of the 112,000 un troops stationed across the globe come from developing countries like india and pakistan , with rich western nations footing the bill for their deployment .
the united states for instance pays for 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget , but along with europe is facing a recession triggered by the international financial crisis . no eu soldiers to spare for dr congo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un called for an interim eu " bridging force " for dr congo eu states such as germany , which favor diplomatic rather than military solutions to conflict areas , complain that iraq and expanding commitments in afghanistan mean that they have no soldiers to spare for other un missions , such as the dr congo . over the weekend united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon called for an eu " bridging force , " saying it may take up to six months for the un to deploy 3,000 more peacekeepers to congo to boost its 17,000-strong monuc force .
the eu has a reserve contingent of combat troops , which could be deployed on short notice . the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday , but the bloc has been extremely reluctant to commit troops in the dr congo , a former belgian colony where some 250,000 civilians have been displaced by the violent clashes between pro-government militias and renegade tutsi rebels . belgian foreign minister karel de gucht did however say before the meeting monday that there was an urgent need for a bridging mission of 2,500 to 3,000 troops . " it will take four to six months before the additional troops for monuc will arrive and the humanitarian situation is dramatic over there , " de gucht told reporters . britain 's foreign secretary david miliband also told reporters that beefing up the un forces was a priority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups slam eu for not doing more to aid refugees " our position has always been that there is … a un commitment to increase the size of the monuc foce , so the first port of call is for countries to see whether they can add , either at a planning or operational level to that monuc force , " said miliband . aid groups criticize eu for not doing more the un has characterized the fighting in the dr congo as catastrophic and humanitarian aid groups have slammed the eu 's failure to deploy troops . " we have had a month of every possible excuse as to why europe will not send forces to bolster un peacekeepers , " said elise ford , head of oxfam international in brussels in an interview with the bbc . " without an adequate professional force supporting un peacekeepers to provide a measure of security for the population , the killing , raping and looting will continue unabated , " she added .
" we can not stand by and watch . " one senior un security council diplomat from a european country said such criticism was valid , but added that it was time for other countries with large , well-trained armies to offer soldiers to the dr congo and other missions in need of troops . " we 're not the only ones who can do this , " the diplomat said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.12.2008 cinemas prepare for funke fantasy-thriller ' inkheart ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' inkheart ' world premiere is in berlin on tuesday the fantasy film " inkheart , " based on the best-selling youth fiction book series by german author cornelia funke , premieres in cinemas this week . los angeles-based funke is often described as the german equivalent of jk rowling , the author of the harry potter series .
and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brendan fraser plays the lead role earnest beginnings funke started out as a kindergarten teacher and illustrator for children 's books in the german city of hamburg before her writing career took off .
three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .
adult can delight in the complex dialogue and try fiercely to pick out historical figures such as adolf hitler among the plot 's villains .
youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .
one such cg scene shows a desert sandstorm morphing into flesh and blood .
younger children meanwhile can hold their breath , just hoping good will win out over evil .
when and where ?
" inkheart " is to be released first in germany with public screenings from thursday , dec .
11 , followed by britain on friday and italy on jan .
9 .
viewers in the united states will not see the new line cinema production till jan .
23 next year .
much of the film , which was delayed more than eight months by a writer 's strike and marketing hesitations , was shot at shepperton studios near london .
there are further film prospects for funke 's inkworld series , with sequels " inkspell " and " inkdeath " also open for film adaptation . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .

and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .

8 . nearly 600 people have died of the disease since the outbreak began in august and another 300,000 people are particularly susceptible to infection due to lack of food .
the united nations has estimated that nearly 14,000 people have already been infected with the illness . because those figures do not include people who died at home , the real toll is thought to be much higher . the additional grant raises germany 's total aid to zimbabwe this year to nearly 6 million euros . poverty goes hand-in-hand with disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those weakened by a lack of food are more susceptible to cholera the funds are to be spent on rehydration fluids , infusion packs , antibiotics and protective clothing for staff treating cholera patients .
the red cross is also to repair hand-powered water pumps to give more people access to clean drinking water . the country 's water supply network has failed and widespread water contamination has allowed the disease to spread rapidly .
in addition , over half of the population of 12 million is in need of food aid , which makes them more vulnerable to the illness . though children are most susceptible , the cholera outbreak has left many orphans .
zimbabwe already has the highest rate of orphaned children in the world .
it is estimated that over one million children have lost one or both parents to hiv / aids , poverty-related diseases , or - more recently - cholera . more international pressure on mugabe also on monday , european leaders including french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , called for zimbabwe 's long-time leader robert mugabe to step down . " the time has come to put all the pressure on mugabe to step down and give the opportunity once again to the people of zimbabwe to put their lives together , " solana told reporters monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has held power in for 21 years mugabe 's government has accused western governments of using the epidemic as a reason for intervention by the un security council in zimbabwe . " they are dead set on ensuring that there is an invasion of zimbabwe , " said george charamba , mugabe 's chief spokesman . the epidemic has been caused by the collapse of water and sanitation services in urban areas , as evidenced by the raw effluent flowing out of people 's drains , and piles of uncollected garbage . mugabe , who has been in a political deadlock with opposition leader morgan tsvangirai over a power-sharing agreement , has been blamed for current crisis .
meanwhile , the country 's once strong economy continues to plummet , with basic food supplies running out and prices doubling every 24 hours . mugabe , however , has accused the west of taking advantage of his country 's crisis to have him ousted . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the aim was to frighten people with a mock-up , " he said ahead of the verdict . presiding judge ottmar breidling expressed doubts about this version of events in a hearing in late october , noting that dummy explosives would have no need for detonators , as were found in the suitcases on the trains . a " foothold " in religious extremism dib is the youngest of 13 children .
two of his brothers were killed combat in the middle east , while two others are being held in lebanese prisons on suspicion of terror . due to his limited knowledge of german , dib 's university applications in germany were repeatedly turned down .

so why were the spooks listening in on aid workers ? the charity , which is aimed at fighting hunger and has been active in afghanistan since 1980 , directed its appeal directly to germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel .
" we are astonished and puzzled to learn that a german constitutional body should have kept tabs on an independent german aid organisation , " german agro action general secretary hans-joachim preuss wrote in a letter to merkel .
he said the group had learned from the bnd itself that the intelligence service had secretly monitored at least 2000 e-mails , fax messages and telephone conversions within the charity between october 2005 and april 2008 .
preuß asked merkel to ensure that the surveillance was discontinued and said that the charity was consulting with lawyers as to whether the bnd might have violated the german constitution .
in april of this year , it emerged that the bnd had also intercepted emails between a german journalist and afghanistan 's economics minister in 2006 .
communications harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the charity wants the bnd to focus on prevent acts of taliban insurgency other german agro action employees said the revelations had hurt the charity 's ability to do its work .
" it will be more difficult for us to get information from other non-governmental organisations if one thinks one might be listened to , " the official in charge of german agro action 's afghanistan operations , nic lee , told afp news agency .
and he questioned the logic behind the surveillance .
in a statement to the dpa news agency , lee said it was " a transparent waste of taxpayers ' money to spy on organizations whose reports are public anyway . "
" the german secret service should concentrate on the taliban instead , " lee told dpa .
the deputy chairman of parliamentary intelligence oversight committee , max stadler of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also told a german radio station that the bnd should be called to testify about the affair in the german bundestag .
kosovo repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have not been good weeks for bnd head uhrlau the latest revelations increased the heat on bnd head ernst uhrlau , who 's still reeling from the arrest of three bnd operatives in kosovo last month .
the operatives were part of a covert mission so secret that even german government representatives in kosovo knew nothing of it .
they were arrested after they visited the site of a bomb attack on an eu target in the city of pristina .
the three men were later released , but the controversy raised further questions about the legality and efficiency of bnd operations .
green parliamentarian hans-christian stoebele has joined colleagues from the fdp and the conservatives bavarian sister party , the csu , in calling for further investigations .
" we have to find out what 's gone out of control there , " stroebele told the dpa news agency .
the main spokesman for the current government , on the other hand , has said uhrlau enjoys the " unrestricted trust " of the chancellor and the chancellor 's office . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so why were the spooks listening in on aid workers ? the charity , which is aimed at fighting hunger and has been active in afghanistan since 1980 , directed its appeal directly to germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel .
" we are astonished and puzzled to learn that a german constitutional body should have kept tabs on an independent german aid organisation , " german agro action general secretary hans-joachim preuss wrote in a letter to merkel .
he said the group had learned from the bnd itself that the intelligence service had secretly monitored at least 2000 e-mails , fax messages and telephone conversions within the charity between october 2005 and april 2008 .
preuß asked merkel to ensure that the surveillance was discontinued and said that the charity was consulting with lawyers as to whether the bnd might have violated the german constitution .
in april of this year , it emerged that the bnd had also intercepted emails between a german journalist and afghanistan 's economics minister in 2006 .
communications harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the charity wants the bnd to focus on prevent acts of taliban insurgency other german agro action employees said the revelations had hurt the charity 's ability to do its work .
" it will be more difficult for us to get information from other non-governmental organisations if one thinks one might be listened to , " the official in charge of german agro action 's afghanistan operations , nic lee , told afp news agency .
and he questioned the logic behind the surveillance .
in a statement to the dpa news agency , lee said it was " a transparent waste of taxpayers ' money to spy on organizations whose reports are public anyway . "
" the german secret service should concentrate on the taliban instead , " lee told dpa .
the deputy chairman of parliamentary intelligence oversight committee , max stadler of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also told a german radio station that the bnd should be called to testify about the affair in the german bundestag .
kosovo repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have not been good weeks for bnd head uhrlau the latest revelations increased the heat on bnd head ernst uhrlau , who 's still reeling from the arrest of three bnd operatives in kosovo last month .
the operatives were part of a covert mission so secret that even german government representatives in kosovo knew nothing of it .
they were arrested after they visited the site of a bomb attack on an eu target in the city of pristina .
the three men were later released , but the controversy raised further questions about the legality and efficiency of bnd operations .
green parliamentarian hans-christian stoebele has joined colleagues from the fdp and the conservatives bavarian sister party , the csu , in calling for further investigations .
" we have to find out what 's gone out of control there , " stroebele told the dpa news agency .
the main spokesman for the current government , on the other hand , has said uhrlau enjoys the " unrestricted trust " of the chancellor and the chancellor 's office . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .
a coroner 's report shows the boy was shot in the chest .
teachers lead mass demonstration against government schools and universities across the country closed their doors for three days and hundreds of teachers , university lecturers and students rallied in central athens .
around 2,000 protesters , led by the olme teachers ' union , marched on parliament carrying a large banner reading " assassins , the government is the culprit " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rioting has already caused widespread damage greece braced for more widespread protests and possible violence following the funeral .
the shooting was seen as the last straw by many young greeks whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment rate and low wages .
unemployment is pegged at over 7 per cent and nearly 20 per cent of greeks live below the poverty line , earning less than 600 euros -lrb- $ 775 -rrb- a month .
" everyone appears to have let our children down .
students have become more hostile towards us and to figures of authority , " said christos kittas , after resigning as the dean of athens university after rioting spread to campuses .
rioting , political pressure could bring down government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity measures of the government are unpopular public unrest has grown with the conservative government 's austerity measures , with unions regularly demonstrating against privatizations , pension reforms and the cost of living , and this latest incident could topple the unpopular conservative government .
the main opposition socialist party leader george papandreou called on the government to resign in an effort to end the crisis .
" the government has lost public confidence , " papandreou told pasok socialist party deputies .
" the only thing it can give this country is to depart ... to seek a public verdict so that the people can give a solution . "
three successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted across greece and left many athenians angry about the response of the government and police to the riots and their inability to stop the destruction .
within hours of the shooting , riots erupted throughout greece , starting from the capital athens and quickly spreading to the northern port city of thessaloniki , volos , thessalia and to the holiday islands of corfu and crete .
almost every city across the country saw cars , buildings , banks and shops torched , looted or smashed .
greek leaders ' calls for calm go unheeded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis vowed to crack down on the rioters greece 's president appealed for calm and prime minister costas karamanlis vowed to crack down on the unrest , but protesters again defied the government and there was new unrest in athens and other cities .
karamanlis called a crisis cabinet meeting on monday night and held new meetings with president karolos papoulias and leaders of allied and opposition political parties on tuesday .
" we will tolerate no leniency in the attribution of responsibility , " the prime minister said after talks with the president .
papoulias meanwhile appealed for calm , calling on greeks to " honor alexis ' memory peacefully . "
the government , already in trouble over the state of the economy and a series of political scandals , has been strongly criticized over the havoc .
" the whole country was delivered to chaos by an irresponsible government , " the eleftherotypia daily said in an editorial tuesday .
the violence has showcased the organizational capacity of urban radicals and the failure of the government to crack down , critics said .
public anger aimed at " outlaw " police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the greek police act like they 're above the law many of the protesters say that the killing of grigoropoulos was the latest example of police acting as if they were above the law .
" this is not just a random incident , " said magda , a 27-year-old hotel worker who was participating in a leftwing demonstration in athens .
" it has to do with the role played by the security forces ... who enjoy impunity . "
lawyer dimitris beladis , who specializes in urban troubles , the killing " is the detonator of a sort of social explosion due to economic insecurity that affects many youths and those who are unemployed or badly paid . "
abroad , demonstrators attempted to take over the greek embassies in london and cyprus .
in the german capital berlin , protesters describing themselves as anarchists invaded the greek consulate on monday .
more than 60 people reportedly stormed the greek embassy in paris on tuesday .

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .

" the only thing it can give this country is to depart ... to seek a public verdict so that the people can give a solution . "
three successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted across greece and left many athenians angry about the response of the government and police to the riots and their inability to stop the destruction .
within hours of the shooting , riots erupted throughout greece , starting from the capital athens and quickly spreading to the northern port city of thessaloniki , volos , thessalia and to the holiday islands of corfu and crete .

both want more flexibility . the one-day meeting came ahead of an eu climate change summit on december 11-12 , at which the bloc hopes to institute a system by 2013 to auction off permits for the right to emit carbon dioxide .
poland , which is heavily dependent on coal , has expressed serious reservations about the proposal as well as the bloc 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by twenty percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 .
it had even hinted at the possibility of vetoing such a deal , which it says would favor more established eu member states over newer ones .
merkel , who has vowed to resist any eu climate measures that would cut german jobs , said that she and her polish counterpart were basically on the same page on this issue .
" we have made a great step forward , " merkel told journalists after the meeting .
" the possibility of a veto has become smaller . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of eastern europe requires coal to meet its power needs tusk concurred with that assessment .
" neither poland nor germany are interested in a veto , " the polish prime minister said .
" we want to work out a package which will take into consideration everyone 's concerns . "
perhaps with an eye toward france , which is hoping to pass the agreement unanimously , merkel said that eu member states needed to understand one another 's needs .
" poland wants to push back the auctioning process and that is understandable , given that poland has a long way to go before replacing its coal-fired power plants , " she said .
" but obviously we need to talk about the details here . "
those talks will be held in brussels later this week .
but with many eu members worried about climate change , there 's no guarantee the tone will be as amicable as at the merkel and tusk 's meeting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.12.2008 bremen 's diego to miss four games for strangle attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego later used his hands , and not his head , against karlsruhe a momentary loss of muscular control means werder will be without their playmaker until late february .
with striker claudio pizarro also banned , bremen 's title hopes may be dead and buried . games do n't get much costlier than bremen 's 1-0 defeat at karlsruhe last weekend .
not only did last year 's runners-up drop three points to what was then the worst team in the league but the team 's cool appeared to blow along with its title chances .
the german football federation , the dfb , has now also suspended playmaker diego , the motor of bremen 's offense , for four games after video footage showed him trying to strangle karlsruhe defender christian eichner .
one day before , on december 8 , the dfb banned striker claudio pizarro for three games for slapping karlruhe 's martin stoll in the dying minutes of the match .
bremen and the two players affected say they accept the suspensions - a wise decision considering that the prospects for a successful appeal would be next to none .
still two questions remain .
how did a perennial league powerhouse , which is currently tenth in the league , go so far off the rails ?
and what if anything can bremen do to get back on track ?
rogue electrons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has been the most irate season of schaaf 's tenure werder have astonished fans in recent years by consistently finishing in the top three despite losing key players to wealthier clubs almost every season .
much of the credit has to go to coach thomas schaaf 's finely honed team system .
but this season , key players have lost their heads instead of concentrating on their appointed roles .
in the 6th round , star defender per mertesacker earned a red card and a three-game ban for pulling down an opponent with a clear line to goal in bremen 's match against hoffenheim .
in round 12 , up-and-coming midfielder mesut oezil kicked out at a bochum player , for which he was also sent off and given an involuntarily three-round holiday .
with diego and pizarro now also relegated to the sidelines , much is being written about bremen 's implosion .
but that 's the wrong metaphor .
instead , bremen are suffering from a void at the heart of the team .
veteran midfielder torsten frings has been more concerned about feuding with germany coach joachim loew over his standing in the national squad than about leading bremen .
and daniel jensen , another player who has provided stability , has been out for most of the season with injury .
thus , bremen are more like an unstable atom then a dying star .
the nucleus has lost the pull to make the whole cohere , and the electrons are beginning to spin out of control .
tricky off-season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen could sure use a return to form by sanogo bremen had already said they would try to off-load some of their non-performers , including strikers boubacar sanogo and martin harnik , during the winter break .
but unless they want to write off this season , this long-term strategy may have to be modified to address some pressing needs .
not only will diego and pizarro have to be replaced .
hugo almeida could also now be out for some weeks with an injury so werder have to either buy a forward or rehabilitate one of those they already have .
bremen could also use a couple of stocking stuffers for their porous defense , but bringing in too much new talent could result in a glut , and further damage to team chemistry , when regulars return from injury and suspension .
werder are now eight points adrift of third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league .
with wolfsburg still to play this year , and three more league games to survive before the team is back to full strength , bremen could find itself too far back by march to mount a realistic challenge at the top three .
in any case , it 's going to be a precarious christmas this year for what was once the bundesliga 's most consistent club . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brendan fraser plays the lead role earnest beginnings funke started out as a kindergarten teacher and illustrator for children 's books in the german city of hamburg before her writing career took off .
three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .
adult can delight in the complex dialogue and try fiercely to pick out historical figures such as adolf hitler among the plot 's villains .
youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .
one such cg scene shows a desert sandstorm morphing into flesh and blood .
younger children meanwhile can hold their breath , just hoping good will win out over evil .

" inkheart " is to be released first in germany with public screenings from thursday , dec .

and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .

three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .

youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .

and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brendan fraser plays the lead role earnest beginnings funke started out as a kindergarten teacher and illustrator for children 's books in the german city of hamburg before her writing career took off .
three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .
adult can delight in the complex dialogue and try fiercely to pick out historical figures such as adolf hitler among the plot 's villains .
youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .
one such cg scene shows a desert sandstorm morphing into flesh and blood .
younger children meanwhile can hold their breath , just hoping good will win out over evil .

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce . " " this proposal , steered by the self-interest of eu member states , sets the bar far too low , " said the coalition , as quoted by afp news agency . opposition from some eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a strong coal tradition in much of europe the eu 's climate package has in recent weeks also come under fire from its member states that depend the most on coal . poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they 've also demanded the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states . in addition , italy has demanded that the climate goals be reviewed half-way , in 2014 , a move some say could threaten investment and jobs in alternative energy sectors . the final climate deal is set to be agreed thursday and friday at the brussels summit . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce . " " this proposal , steered by the self-interest of eu member states , sets the bar far too low , " said the coalition , as quoted by afp news agency . opposition from some eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a strong coal tradition in much of europe the eu 's climate package has in recent weeks also come under fire from its member states that depend the most on coal . poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they 've also demanded the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states . in addition , italy has demanded that the climate goals be reviewed half-way , in 2014 , a move some say could threaten investment and jobs in alternative energy sectors . the final climate deal is set to be agreed thursday and friday at the brussels summit . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not only did last year 's runners-up drop three points to what was then the worst team in the league but the team 's cool appeared to blow along with its title chances .
the german football federation , the dfb , has now also suspended playmaker diego , the motor of bremen 's offense , for four games after video footage showed him trying to strangle karlsruhe defender christian eichner .
one day before , on december 8 , the dfb banned striker claudio pizarro for three games for slapping karlruhe 's martin stoll in the dying minutes of the match .
bremen and the two players affected say they accept the suspensions - a wise decision considering that the prospects for a successful appeal would be next to none .
still two questions remain .
how did a perennial league powerhouse , which is currently tenth in the league , go so far off the rails ?
and what if anything can bremen do to get back on track ?

but this season , key players have lost their heads instead of concentrating on their appointed roles .
in the 6th round , star defender per mertesacker earned a red card and a three-game ban for pulling down an opponent with a clear line to goal in bremen 's match against hoffenheim .
in round 12 , up-and-coming midfielder mesut oezil kicked out at a bochum player , for which he was also sent off and given an involuntarily three-round holiday .
with diego and pizarro now also relegated to the sidelines , much is being written about bremen 's implosion .
but that 's the wrong metaphor .
instead , bremen are suffering from a void at the heart of the team .
veteran midfielder torsten frings has been more concerned about feuding with germany coach joachim loew over his standing in the national squad than about leading bremen .
and daniel jensen , another player who has provided stability , has been out for most of the season with injury .
thus , bremen are more like an unstable atom then a dying star .

so why were the spooks listening in on aid workers ? the charity , which is aimed at fighting hunger and has been active in afghanistan since 1980 , directed its appeal directly to germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel .
" we are astonished and puzzled to learn that a german constitutional body should have kept tabs on an independent german aid organisation , " german agro action general secretary hans-joachim preuss wrote in a letter to merkel .
he said the group had learned from the bnd itself that the intelligence service had secretly monitored at least 2000 e-mails , fax messages and telephone conversions within the charity between october 2005 and april 2008 .
preuß asked merkel to ensure that the surveillance was discontinued and said that the charity was consulting with lawyers as to whether the bnd might have violated the german constitution .

so why were the spooks listening in on aid workers ? the charity , which is aimed at fighting hunger and has been active in afghanistan since 1980 , directed its appeal directly to germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel .
" we are astonished and puzzled to learn that a german constitutional body should have kept tabs on an independent german aid organisation , " german agro action general secretary hans-joachim preuss wrote in a letter to merkel .
he said the group had learned from the bnd itself that the intelligence service had secretly monitored at least 2000 e-mails , fax messages and telephone conversions within the charity between october 2005 and april 2008 .
preuß asked merkel to ensure that the surveillance was discontinued and said that the charity was consulting with lawyers as to whether the bnd might have violated the german constitution .
in april of this year , it emerged that the bnd had also intercepted emails between a german journalist and afghanistan 's economics minister in 2006 .
communications harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the charity wants the bnd to focus on prevent acts of taliban insurgency other german agro action employees said the revelations had hurt the charity 's ability to do its work .
" it will be more difficult for us to get information from other non-governmental organisations if one thinks one might be listened to , " the official in charge of german agro action 's afghanistan operations , nic lee , told afp news agency .
and he questioned the logic behind the surveillance .
in a statement to the dpa news agency , lee said it was " a transparent waste of taxpayers ' money to spy on organizations whose reports are public anyway . "
" the german secret service should concentrate on the taliban instead , " lee told dpa .
the deputy chairman of parliamentary intelligence oversight committee , max stadler of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also told a german radio station that the bnd should be called to testify about the affair in the german bundestag .
kosovo repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have not been good weeks for bnd head uhrlau the latest revelations increased the heat on bnd head ernst uhrlau , who 's still reeling from the arrest of three bnd operatives in kosovo last month .
the operatives were part of a covert mission so secret that even german government representatives in kosovo knew nothing of it .
they were arrested after they visited the site of a bomb attack on an eu target in the city of pristina .
the three men were later released , but the controversy raised further questions about the legality and efficiency of bnd operations .
green parliamentarian hans-christian stoebele has joined colleagues from the fdp and the conservatives bavarian sister party , the csu , in calling for further investigations .
" we have to find out what 's gone out of control there , " stroebele told the dpa news agency .
the main spokesman for the current government , on the other hand , has said uhrlau enjoys the " unrestricted trust " of the chancellor and the chancellor 's office . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both want more flexibility . the one-day meeting came ahead of an eu climate change summit on december 11-12 , at which the bloc hopes to institute a system by 2013 to auction off permits for the right to emit carbon dioxide .
poland , which is heavily dependent on coal , has expressed serious reservations about the proposal as well as the bloc 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by twenty percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 .
it had even hinted at the possibility of vetoing such a deal , which it says would favor more established eu member states over newer ones .
merkel , who has vowed to resist any eu climate measures that would cut german jobs , said that she and her polish counterpart were basically on the same page on this issue .
" we have made a great step forward , " merkel told journalists after the meeting .
" the possibility of a veto has become smaller . "

the eu is taking over a un security mission in kosovo , but is relunctant to commit troops in dr congo . the former breakaway province of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from serbia in february , will go from being a ward of the united nations to being under the auspices of a new european union-led mission on tuesday , dec .
9 . charged with overseeing the reform of the criminal justice system , the eu is expected to take urgent measures to resolve kosovo 's backlog of war crimes . " ten years after the end of the war in kosovo , the eu-led mission should ensure that the relatives of more than 3,000 disappeared and abducted people are told the truth about the fate of their loved ones and the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice , " said nicola duckworth , head of amnesty international 's europe program . under the eu plan , some 2,000 of the mission 's eulex police force will take over un responsibilities in kosovo .
eulex would operate " all over kosovo , " including the serb-controlled areas , according to a police spokeswoman . eu takes over from a strapped un short on troops and cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu takes over un mission in kosovo on tuesday the deployment plan comes at a time when un peacekeeping is headed towards a crisis with the demand for troops around the world 's hot spots skyrocketing .
furthermore un officials say that the annual budget is insufficient to cover the cost of current commitments in the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic as well as somalia , where the eu has just launched an anti-piracy mission . un peacekeepers may find it hard over the next few years to finance missions as member states feel the heat from the global financial crisis , fabienne hara , vice-president of the international crisis group , a brussels-based think-tank , told reuters news agency . " contributions will probably not grow at the very least , if not diminish , " she said , adding that some missions " may not funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources . " most of the 112,000 un troops stationed across the globe come from developing countries like india and pakistan , with rich western nations footing the bill for their deployment .
the united states for instance pays for 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget , but along with europe is facing a recession triggered by the international financial crisis . no eu soldiers to spare for dr congo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un called for an interim eu " bridging force " for dr congo eu states such as germany , which favor diplomatic rather than military solutions to conflict areas , complain that iraq and expanding commitments in afghanistan mean that they have no soldiers to spare for other un missions , such as the dr congo . over the weekend united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon called for an eu " bridging force , " saying it may take up to six months for the un to deploy 3,000 more peacekeepers to congo to boost its 17,000-strong monuc force .
the eu has a reserve contingent of combat troops , which could be deployed on short notice . the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday , but the bloc has been extremely reluctant to commit troops in the dr congo , a former belgian colony where some 250,000 civilians have been displaced by the violent clashes between pro-government militias and renegade tutsi rebels . belgian foreign minister karel de gucht did however say before the meeting monday that there was an urgent need for a bridging mission of 2,500 to 3,000 troops . " it will take four to six months before the additional troops for monuc will arrive and the humanitarian situation is dramatic over there , " de gucht told reporters . britain 's foreign secretary david miliband also told reporters that beefing up the un forces was a priority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups slam eu for not doing more to aid refugees " our position has always been that there is … a un commitment to increase the size of the monuc foce , so the first port of call is for countries to see whether they can add , either at a planning or operational level to that monuc force , " said miliband . aid groups criticize eu for not doing more the un has characterized the fighting in the dr congo as catastrophic and humanitarian aid groups have slammed the eu 's failure to deploy troops . " we have had a month of every possible excuse as to why europe will not send forces to bolster un peacekeepers , " said elise ford , head of oxfam international in brussels in an interview with the bbc . " without an adequate professional force supporting un peacekeepers to provide a measure of security for the population , the killing , raping and looting will continue unabated , " she added .
" we can not stand by and watch . " one senior un security council diplomat from a european country said such criticism was valid , but added that it was time for other countries with large , well-trained armies to offer soldiers to the dr congo and other missions in need of troops . " we 're not the only ones who can do this , " the diplomat said .

where are the developing countries who want to have seats on the security council ?

both want more flexibility . the one-day meeting came ahead of an eu climate change summit on december 11-12 , at which the bloc hopes to institute a system by 2013 to auction off permits for the right to emit carbon dioxide .
poland , which is heavily dependent on coal , has expressed serious reservations about the proposal as well as the bloc 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by twenty percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 .
it had even hinted at the possibility of vetoing such a deal , which it says would favor more established eu member states over newer ones .
merkel , who has vowed to resist any eu climate measures that would cut german jobs , said that she and her polish counterpart were basically on the same page on this issue .

" the possibility of a veto has become smaller . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of eastern europe requires coal to meet its power needs tusk concurred with that assessment .
" neither poland nor germany are interested in a veto , " the polish prime minister said .
" we want to work out a package which will take into consideration everyone 's concerns . "
perhaps with an eye toward france , which is hoping to pass the agreement unanimously , merkel said that eu member states needed to understand one another 's needs .
" poland wants to push back the auctioning process and that is understandable , given that poland has a long way to go before replacing its coal-fired power plants , " she said .

the eu is taking over a un security mission in kosovo , but is relunctant to commit troops in dr congo . the former breakaway province of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from serbia in february , will go from being a ward of the united nations to being under the auspices of a new european union-led mission on tuesday , dec .
9 . charged with overseeing the reform of the criminal justice system , the eu is expected to take urgent measures to resolve kosovo 's backlog of war crimes . " ten years after the end of the war in kosovo , the eu-led mission should ensure that the relatives of more than 3,000 disappeared and abducted people are told the truth about the fate of their loved ones and the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice , " said nicola duckworth , head of amnesty international 's europe program . under the eu plan , some 2,000 of the mission 's eulex police force will take over un responsibilities in kosovo .

investigators said the botched bombing could have ended in a bloodbath .
the defense argued the devices were not intended to explode . a dusseldorf court tuesday , dec .
9 , convicted the 24-year-old lebanese youssef al-hajj dib of planting bombs on two trains in germany that would have caused mass carnage if they had exploded . he was sentenced to life imprisonment for multiple attempted murders .
his accomplice , jihad hamad , was convicted at a separate trial in lebanon and is serving a 12-year prison term in beirut . german authorities said dib was a hardened islamic extremist who was trying to kill as many people as possible in revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases contained gas cannisters primed to explode men identified by police as dib and hamad were captured on security cameras placing suitcases packed with homemade explosives on two trains carrying 280 people on july 31 , 2006 . the images ran in heavy rotation on national television as the country digested how close it may have come to the first islamist attack on german soil since the anti-us suicide hijackings of sept .
11 , 2001 , which were planned in part in the german port city of hamburg . " germany was never closer to an islamist attack , " state prosecutor duscha gmel said . prosecutors argue that the explosions could have killed up to 75 people , saying only a technical fault prevented a massacre in a plot allegedly modeled on the deadly train blasts in madrid in 2004 and london in 2005 . accused tells of plan to scare not murder the defendant told the regional superior court in this western city on dec .
2 at the end of his year-long trial that he had never planned to murder anyone but had aimed to frighten the german public over the mohammed cartoons . " i swear by god almighty that it was never my intention to kill , " he said in a final statement to the court , adding that he knew " there would be no explosion " when he left the device on the train . he said hamad , who is serving a 12-year sentence in beirut over the case , was lying when he told lebanese investigators that the two had plotted mass murder . " it is because he was tortured , " dib asserted . would-be bombers fled to lebanon both men had lived as students in germany .
after putting the suitcases on the trains , they each disembarked at the next station and flew from cologne to istanbul and then lebanon , where hamad was captured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad hamad is serving 12 years in lebanon dib was arrested after he returned to germany days later . his defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz told the court that his client had made a conscious decision not to include oxygen in gas canisters used in the homemade bombs - the missing ingredient necessary for an explosion . " the aim was to frighten people with a mock-up , " he said ahead of the verdict . presiding judge ottmar breidling expressed doubts about this version of events in a hearing in late october , noting that dummy explosives would have no need for detonators , as were found in the suitcases on the trains . a " foothold " in religious extremism dib is the youngest of 13 children .
two of his brothers were killed combat in the middle east , while two others are being held in lebanese prisons on suspicion of terror . due to his limited knowledge of german , dib 's university applications in germany were repeatedly turned down .
court psychologists said he likely turned to islamic extremism because he could not live up to his parents ' expectations .

" we need to invest in a digital , low-carbon , environmentally-friendly europe of the 21st century , " said brown .
investment now in technology , construction and public works infrastructure would ensure that the " downturn is followed by an upturn , " he added . brown also said that a protectionist approach would " delay any recovery " and only deepen the current crisis . monday 's meeting in london preceded a two-day eu summit in brussels , beginning on thursday , where both the economy and climate change are to top the agenda . barroso has proposed a 200-billion-euro bloc wide stimulus plan , which would include spending on low-carbon public transport , high-speed internet connections and improvements to energy infrastructure . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so why were the spooks listening in on aid workers ? the charity , which is aimed at fighting hunger and has been active in afghanistan since 1980 , directed its appeal directly to germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel .
" we are astonished and puzzled to learn that a german constitutional body should have kept tabs on an independent german aid organisation , " german agro action general secretary hans-joachim preuss wrote in a letter to merkel .
he said the group had learned from the bnd itself that the intelligence service had secretly monitored at least 2000 e-mails , fax messages and telephone conversions within the charity between october 2005 and april 2008 .
preuß asked merkel to ensure that the surveillance was discontinued and said that the charity was consulting with lawyers as to whether the bnd might have violated the german constitution .
in april of this year , it emerged that the bnd had also intercepted emails between a german journalist and afghanistan 's economics minister in 2006 .
communications harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the charity wants the bnd to focus on prevent acts of taliban insurgency other german agro action employees said the revelations had hurt the charity 's ability to do its work .
" it will be more difficult for us to get information from other non-governmental organisations if one thinks one might be listened to , " the official in charge of german agro action 's afghanistan operations , nic lee , told afp news agency .
and he questioned the logic behind the surveillance .
in a statement to the dpa news agency , lee said it was " a transparent waste of taxpayers ' money to spy on organizations whose reports are public anyway . "
" the german secret service should concentrate on the taliban instead , " lee told dpa .
the deputy chairman of parliamentary intelligence oversight committee , max stadler of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also told a german radio station that the bnd should be called to testify about the affair in the german bundestag .
kosovo repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have not been good weeks for bnd head uhrlau the latest revelations increased the heat on bnd head ernst uhrlau , who 's still reeling from the arrest of three bnd operatives in kosovo last month .
the operatives were part of a covert mission so secret that even german government representatives in kosovo knew nothing of it .
they were arrested after they visited the site of a bomb attack on an eu target in the city of pristina .
the three men were later released , but the controversy raised further questions about the legality and efficiency of bnd operations .
green parliamentarian hans-christian stoebele has joined colleagues from the fdp and the conservatives bavarian sister party , the csu , in calling for further investigations .
" we have to find out what 's gone out of control there , " stroebele told the dpa news agency .
the main spokesman for the current government , on the other hand , has said uhrlau enjoys the " unrestricted trust " of the chancellor and the chancellor 's office . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so why were the spooks listening in on aid workers ? the charity , which is aimed at fighting hunger and has been active in afghanistan since 1980 , directed its appeal directly to germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel .
" we are astonished and puzzled to learn that a german constitutional body should have kept tabs on an independent german aid organisation , " german agro action general secretary hans-joachim preuss wrote in a letter to merkel .
he said the group had learned from the bnd itself that the intelligence service had secretly monitored at least 2000 e-mails , fax messages and telephone conversions within the charity between october 2005 and april 2008 .
preuß asked merkel to ensure that the surveillance was discontinued and said that the charity was consulting with lawyers as to whether the bnd might have violated the german constitution .
in april of this year , it emerged that the bnd had also intercepted emails between a german journalist and afghanistan 's economics minister in 2006 .
communications harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the charity wants the bnd to focus on prevent acts of taliban insurgency other german agro action employees said the revelations had hurt the charity 's ability to do its work .
" it will be more difficult for us to get information from other non-governmental organisations if one thinks one might be listened to , " the official in charge of german agro action 's afghanistan operations , nic lee , told afp news agency .
and he questioned the logic behind the surveillance .
in a statement to the dpa news agency , lee said it was " a transparent waste of taxpayers ' money to spy on organizations whose reports are public anyway . "
" the german secret service should concentrate on the taliban instead , " lee told dpa .
the deputy chairman of parliamentary intelligence oversight committee , max stadler of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also told a german radio station that the bnd should be called to testify about the affair in the german bundestag .
kosovo repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have not been good weeks for bnd head uhrlau the latest revelations increased the heat on bnd head ernst uhrlau , who 's still reeling from the arrest of three bnd operatives in kosovo last month .
the operatives were part of a covert mission so secret that even german government representatives in kosovo knew nothing of it .
they were arrested after they visited the site of a bomb attack on an eu target in the city of pristina .
the three men were later released , but the controversy raised further questions about the legality and efficiency of bnd operations .
green parliamentarian hans-christian stoebele has joined colleagues from the fdp and the conservatives bavarian sister party , the csu , in calling for further investigations .
" we have to find out what 's gone out of control there , " stroebele told the dpa news agency .
the main spokesman for the current government , on the other hand , has said uhrlau enjoys the " unrestricted trust " of the chancellor and the chancellor 's office . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .
a coroner 's report shows the boy was shot in the chest .
teachers lead mass demonstration against government schools and universities across the country closed their doors for three days and hundreds of teachers , university lecturers and students rallied in central athens .
around 2,000 protesters , led by the olme teachers ' union , marched on parliament carrying a large banner reading " assassins , the government is the culprit " .

" the government has lost public confidence , " papandreou told pasok socialist party deputies .
" the only thing it can give this country is to depart ... to seek a public verdict so that the people can give a solution . "
three successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted across greece and left many athenians angry about the response of the government and police to the riots and their inability to stop the destruction .
within hours of the shooting , riots erupted throughout greece , starting from the capital athens and quickly spreading to the northern port city of thessaloniki , volos , thessalia and to the holiday islands of corfu and crete .
almost every city across the country saw cars , buildings , banks and shops torched , looted or smashed .

karamanlis called a crisis cabinet meeting on monday night and held new meetings with president karolos papoulias and leaders of allied and opposition political parties on tuesday .
" we will tolerate no leniency in the attribution of responsibility , " the prime minister said after talks with the president .
papoulias meanwhile appealed for calm , calling on greeks to " honor alexis ' memory peacefully . "
the government , already in trouble over the state of the economy and a series of political scandals , has been strongly criticized over the havoc .
" the whole country was delivered to chaos by an irresponsible government , " the eleftherotypia daily said in an editorial tuesday .

" it has to do with the role played by the security forces ... who enjoy impunity . "
lawyer dimitris beladis , who specializes in urban troubles , the killing " is the detonator of a sort of social explosion due to economic insecurity that affects many youths and those who are unemployed or badly paid . "

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .
a coroner 's report shows the boy was shot in the chest .
teachers lead mass demonstration against government schools and universities across the country closed their doors for three days and hundreds of teachers , university lecturers and students rallied in central athens .
around 2,000 protesters , led by the olme teachers ' union , marched on parliament carrying a large banner reading " assassins , the government is the culprit " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rioting has already caused widespread damage greece braced for more widespread protests and possible violence following the funeral .
the shooting was seen as the last straw by many young greeks whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment rate and low wages .
unemployment is pegged at over 7 per cent and nearly 20 per cent of greeks live below the poverty line , earning less than 600 euros -lrb- $ 775 -rrb- a month .
" everyone appears to have let our children down .
students have become more hostile towards us and to figures of authority , " said christos kittas , after resigning as the dean of athens university after rioting spread to campuses .
rioting , political pressure could bring down government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity measures of the government are unpopular public unrest has grown with the conservative government 's austerity measures , with unions regularly demonstrating against privatizations , pension reforms and the cost of living , and this latest incident could topple the unpopular conservative government .
the main opposition socialist party leader george papandreou called on the government to resign in an effort to end the crisis .
" the government has lost public confidence , " papandreou told pasok socialist party deputies .
" the only thing it can give this country is to depart ... to seek a public verdict so that the people can give a solution . "
three successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted across greece and left many athenians angry about the response of the government and police to the riots and their inability to stop the destruction .
within hours of the shooting , riots erupted throughout greece , starting from the capital athens and quickly spreading to the northern port city of thessaloniki , volos , thessalia and to the holiday islands of corfu and crete .
almost every city across the country saw cars , buildings , banks and shops torched , looted or smashed .
greek leaders ' calls for calm go unheeded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis vowed to crack down on the rioters greece 's president appealed for calm and prime minister costas karamanlis vowed to crack down on the unrest , but protesters again defied the government and there was new unrest in athens and other cities .
karamanlis called a crisis cabinet meeting on monday night and held new meetings with president karolos papoulias and leaders of allied and opposition political parties on tuesday .
" we will tolerate no leniency in the attribution of responsibility , " the prime minister said after talks with the president .
papoulias meanwhile appealed for calm , calling on greeks to " honor alexis ' memory peacefully . "
the government , already in trouble over the state of the economy and a series of political scandals , has been strongly criticized over the havoc .
" the whole country was delivered to chaos by an irresponsible government , " the eleftherotypia daily said in an editorial tuesday .
the violence has showcased the organizational capacity of urban radicals and the failure of the government to crack down , critics said .
public anger aimed at " outlaw " police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the greek police act like they 're above the law many of the protesters say that the killing of grigoropoulos was the latest example of police acting as if they were above the law .
" this is not just a random incident , " said magda , a 27-year-old hotel worker who was participating in a leftwing demonstration in athens .
" it has to do with the role played by the security forces ... who enjoy impunity . "
lawyer dimitris beladis , who specializes in urban troubles , the killing " is the detonator of a sort of social explosion due to economic insecurity that affects many youths and those who are unemployed or badly paid . "
abroad , demonstrators attempted to take over the greek embassies in london and cyprus .
in the german capital berlin , protesters describing themselves as anarchists invaded the greek consulate on monday .
more than 60 people reportedly stormed the greek embassy in paris on tuesday .

the united nations has estimated that nearly 14,000 people have already been infected with the illness . because those figures do not include people who died at home , the real toll is thought to be much higher . the additional grant raises germany 's total aid to zimbabwe this year to nearly 6 million euros . poverty goes hand-in-hand with disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those weakened by a lack of food are more susceptible to cholera the funds are to be spent on rehydration fluids , infusion packs , antibiotics and protective clothing for staff treating cholera patients .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.12.2008 cinemas prepare for funke fantasy-thriller ' inkheart ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' inkheart ' world premiere is in berlin on tuesday the fantasy film " inkheart , " based on the best-selling youth fiction book series by german author cornelia funke , premieres in cinemas this week . los angeles-based funke is often described as the german equivalent of jk rowling , the author of the harry potter series .
and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brendan fraser plays the lead role earnest beginnings funke started out as a kindergarten teacher and illustrator for children 's books in the german city of hamburg before her writing career took off .
three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .
adult can delight in the complex dialogue and try fiercely to pick out historical figures such as adolf hitler among the plot 's villains .
youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .
one such cg scene shows a desert sandstorm morphing into flesh and blood .
younger children meanwhile can hold their breath , just hoping good will win out over evil .
when and where ?
" inkheart " is to be released first in germany with public screenings from thursday , dec .
11 , followed by britain on friday and italy on jan .
9 .
viewers in the united states will not see the new line cinema production till jan .
23 next year .
much of the film , which was delayed more than eight months by a writer 's strike and marketing hesitations , was shot at shepperton studios near london .
there are further film prospects for funke 's inkworld series , with sequels " inkspell " and " inkdeath " also open for film adaptation . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce . " " this proposal , steered by the self-interest of eu member states , sets the bar far too low , " said the coalition , as quoted by afp news agency . opposition from some eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a strong coal tradition in much of europe the eu 's climate package has in recent weeks also come under fire from its member states that depend the most on coal . poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they 've also demanded the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states . in addition , italy has demanded that the climate goals be reviewed half-way , in 2014 , a move some say could threaten investment and jobs in alternative energy sectors . the final climate deal is set to be agreed thursday and friday at the brussels summit . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 09.12.2008 germany increases aid to zimbabwe as cholera death toll rises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lack of clean water has contributed to the spread of cholera as a cholera epidemic continues to spread through zimbabwe , leaving orphans in its wake , germany has pledged an additional 1 million euros in aid as many in europe continues to call for president mugabe to step down . in response to the humanitarian crisis , which brought unprecedented calls for international assistance last week from the zimbabwean government , germany contributed 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- on monday , dec .
8 . nearly 600 people have died of the disease since the outbreak began in august and another 300,000 people are particularly susceptible to infection due to lack of food .
the united nations has estimated that nearly 14,000 people have already been infected with the illness . because those figures do not include people who died at home , the real toll is thought to be much higher . the additional grant raises germany 's total aid to zimbabwe this year to nearly 6 million euros . poverty goes hand-in-hand with disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those weakened by a lack of food are more susceptible to cholera the funds are to be spent on rehydration fluids , infusion packs , antibiotics and protective clothing for staff treating cholera patients .
the red cross is also to repair hand-powered water pumps to give more people access to clean drinking water . the country 's water supply network has failed and widespread water contamination has allowed the disease to spread rapidly .
in addition , over half of the population of 12 million is in need of food aid , which makes them more vulnerable to the illness . though children are most susceptible , the cholera outbreak has left many orphans .
zimbabwe already has the highest rate of orphaned children in the world .
it is estimated that over one million children have lost one or both parents to hiv / aids , poverty-related diseases , or - more recently - cholera . more international pressure on mugabe also on monday , european leaders including french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , called for zimbabwe 's long-time leader robert mugabe to step down .

8 . nearly 600 people have died of the disease since the outbreak began in august and another 300,000 people are particularly susceptible to infection due to lack of food .
the united nations has estimated that nearly 14,000 people have already been infected with the illness . because those figures do not include people who died at home , the real toll is thought to be much higher . the additional grant raises germany 's total aid to zimbabwe this year to nearly 6 million euros . poverty goes hand-in-hand with disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those weakened by a lack of food are more susceptible to cholera the funds are to be spent on rehydration fluids , infusion packs , antibiotics and protective clothing for staff treating cholera patients .
the red cross is also to repair hand-powered water pumps to give more people access to clean drinking water . the country 's water supply network has failed and widespread water contamination has allowed the disease to spread rapidly .
in addition , over half of the population of 12 million is in need of food aid , which makes them more vulnerable to the illness . though children are most susceptible , the cholera outbreak has left many orphans .
zimbabwe already has the highest rate of orphaned children in the world .
it is estimated that over one million children have lost one or both parents to hiv / aids , poverty-related diseases , or - more recently - cholera . more international pressure on mugabe also on monday , european leaders including french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , called for zimbabwe 's long-time leader robert mugabe to step down . " the time has come to put all the pressure on mugabe to step down and give the opportunity once again to the people of zimbabwe to put their lives together , " solana told reporters monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has held power in for 21 years mugabe 's government has accused western governments of using the epidemic as a reason for intervention by the un security council in zimbabwe .

but germany , europe 's largest economy , was n't represented . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy insisted at their meeting on monday , dec .

" i 've been in a lot of european capitals and what you hear is different than what you see in the newspapers , " he said .
" what germany is doing is being closely watched .
but i ca n't see that other countries are doing more than we 're doing in germany .

" we need to invest in a digital , low-carbon , environmentally-friendly europe of the 21st century , " said brown .
investment now in technology , construction and public works infrastructure would ensure that the " downturn is followed by an upturn , " he added . brown also said that a protectionist approach would " delay any recovery " and only deepen the current crisis . monday 's meeting in london preceded a two-day eu summit in brussels , beginning on thursday , where both the economy and climate change are to top the agenda . barroso has proposed a 200-billion-euro bloc wide stimulus plan , which would include spending on low-carbon public transport , high-speed internet connections and improvements to energy infrastructure . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce . " " this proposal , steered by the self-interest of eu member states , sets the bar far too low , " said the coalition , as quoted by afp news agency . opposition from some eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a strong coal tradition in much of europe the eu 's climate package has in recent weeks also come under fire from its member states that depend the most on coal . poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they 've also demanded the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states . in addition , italy has demanded that the climate goals be reviewed half-way , in 2014 , a move some say could threaten investment and jobs in alternative energy sectors . the final climate deal is set to be agreed thursday and friday at the brussels summit . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.12.2008 bremen 's diego to miss four games for strangle attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego later used his hands , and not his head , against karlsruhe a momentary loss of muscular control means werder will be without their playmaker until late february .
with striker claudio pizarro also banned , bremen 's title hopes may be dead and buried . games do n't get much costlier than bremen 's 1-0 defeat at karlsruhe last weekend .
not only did last year 's runners-up drop three points to what was then the worst team in the league but the team 's cool appeared to blow along with its title chances .
the german football federation , the dfb , has now also suspended playmaker diego , the motor of bremen 's offense , for four games after video footage showed him trying to strangle karlsruhe defender christian eichner .
one day before , on december 8 , the dfb banned striker claudio pizarro for three games for slapping karlruhe 's martin stoll in the dying minutes of the match .
bremen and the two players affected say they accept the suspensions - a wise decision considering that the prospects for a successful appeal would be next to none .
still two questions remain .
how did a perennial league powerhouse , which is currently tenth in the league , go so far off the rails ?
and what if anything can bremen do to get back on track ?
rogue electrons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has been the most irate season of schaaf 's tenure werder have astonished fans in recent years by consistently finishing in the top three despite losing key players to wealthier clubs almost every season .
much of the credit has to go to coach thomas schaaf 's finely honed team system .
but this season , key players have lost their heads instead of concentrating on their appointed roles .
in the 6th round , star defender per mertesacker earned a red card and a three-game ban for pulling down an opponent with a clear line to goal in bremen 's match against hoffenheim .
in round 12 , up-and-coming midfielder mesut oezil kicked out at a bochum player , for which he was also sent off and given an involuntarily three-round holiday .
with diego and pizarro now also relegated to the sidelines , much is being written about bremen 's implosion .
but that 's the wrong metaphor .
instead , bremen are suffering from a void at the heart of the team .
veteran midfielder torsten frings has been more concerned about feuding with germany coach joachim loew over his standing in the national squad than about leading bremen .
and daniel jensen , another player who has provided stability , has been out for most of the season with injury .
thus , bremen are more like an unstable atom then a dying star .
the nucleus has lost the pull to make the whole cohere , and the electrons are beginning to spin out of control .
tricky off-season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen could sure use a return to form by sanogo bremen had already said they would try to off-load some of their non-performers , including strikers boubacar sanogo and martin harnik , during the winter break .
but unless they want to write off this season , this long-term strategy may have to be modified to address some pressing needs .
not only will diego and pizarro have to be replaced .
hugo almeida could also now be out for some weeks with an injury so werder have to either buy a forward or rehabilitate one of those they already have .
bremen could also use a couple of stocking stuffers for their porous defense , but bringing in too much new talent could result in a glut , and further damage to team chemistry , when regulars return from injury and suspension .
werder are now eight points adrift of third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league .
with wolfsburg still to play this year , and three more league games to survive before the team is back to full strength , bremen could find itself too far back by march to mount a realistic challenge at the top three .
in any case , it 's going to be a precarious christmas this year for what was once the bundesliga 's most consistent club . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not only did last year 's runners-up drop three points to what was then the worst team in the league but the team 's cool appeared to blow along with its title chances .
the german football federation , the dfb , has now also suspended playmaker diego , the motor of bremen 's offense , for four games after video footage showed him trying to strangle karlsruhe defender christian eichner .
one day before , on december 8 , the dfb banned striker claudio pizarro for three games for slapping karlruhe 's martin stoll in the dying minutes of the match .
bremen and the two players affected say they accept the suspensions - a wise decision considering that the prospects for a successful appeal would be next to none .

veteran midfielder torsten frings has been more concerned about feuding with germany coach joachim loew over his standing in the national squad than about leading bremen .

with striker claudio pizarro also banned , bremen 's title hopes may be dead and buried . games do n't get much costlier than bremen 's 1-0 defeat at karlsruhe last weekend .
not only did last year 's runners-up drop three points to what was then the worst team in the league but the team 's cool appeared to blow along with its title chances .
the german football federation , the dfb , has now also suspended playmaker diego , the motor of bremen 's offense , for four games after video footage showed him trying to strangle karlsruhe defender christian eichner .
one day before , on december 8 , the dfb banned striker claudio pizarro for three games for slapping karlruhe 's martin stoll in the dying minutes of the match .
bremen and the two players affected say they accept the suspensions - a wise decision considering that the prospects for a successful appeal would be next to none .
still two questions remain .
how did a perennial league powerhouse , which is currently tenth in the league , go so far off the rails ?
and what if anything can bremen do to get back on track ?
rogue electrons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has been the most irate season of schaaf 's tenure werder have astonished fans in recent years by consistently finishing in the top three despite losing key players to wealthier clubs almost every season .
much of the credit has to go to coach thomas schaaf 's finely honed team system .
but this season , key players have lost their heads instead of concentrating on their appointed roles .
in the 6th round , star defender per mertesacker earned a red card and a three-game ban for pulling down an opponent with a clear line to goal in bremen 's match against hoffenheim .
in round 12 , up-and-coming midfielder mesut oezil kicked out at a bochum player , for which he was also sent off and given an involuntarily three-round holiday .
with diego and pizarro now also relegated to the sidelines , much is being written about bremen 's implosion .
but that 's the wrong metaphor .
instead , bremen are suffering from a void at the heart of the team .
veteran midfielder torsten frings has been more concerned about feuding with germany coach joachim loew over his standing in the national squad than about leading bremen .
and daniel jensen , another player who has provided stability , has been out for most of the season with injury .
thus , bremen are more like an unstable atom then a dying star .
the nucleus has lost the pull to make the whole cohere , and the electrons are beginning to spin out of control .

but unless they want to write off this season , this long-term strategy may have to be modified to address some pressing needs .
not only will diego and pizarro have to be replaced .
hugo almeida could also now be out for some weeks with an injury so werder have to either buy a forward or rehabilitate one of those they already have .
bremen could also use a couple of stocking stuffers for their porous defense , but bringing in too much new talent could result in a glut , and further damage to team chemistry , when regulars return from injury and suspension .
werder are now eight points adrift of third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league .
with wolfsburg still to play this year , and three more league games to survive before the team is back to full strength , bremen could find itself too far back by march to mount a realistic challenge at the top three .

the eu is taking over a un security mission in kosovo , but is relunctant to commit troops in dr congo . the former breakaway province of kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from serbia in february , will go from being a ward of the united nations to being under the auspices of a new european union-led mission on tuesday , dec .
9 . charged with overseeing the reform of the criminal justice system , the eu is expected to take urgent measures to resolve kosovo 's backlog of war crimes . " ten years after the end of the war in kosovo , the eu-led mission should ensure that the relatives of more than 3,000 disappeared and abducted people are told the truth about the fate of their loved ones and the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice , " said nicola duckworth , head of amnesty international 's europe program . under the eu plan , some 2,000 of the mission 's eulex police force will take over un responsibilities in kosovo .

the eu has a reserve contingent of combat troops , which could be deployed on short notice . the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday , but the bloc has been extremely reluctant to commit troops in the dr congo , a former belgian colony where some 250,000 civilians have been displaced by the violent clashes between pro-government militias and renegade tutsi rebels . belgian foreign minister karel de gucht did however say before the meeting monday that there was an urgent need for a bridging mission of 2,500 to 3,000 troops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.12.2008 bremen 's diego to miss four games for strangle attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego later used his hands , and not his head , against karlsruhe a momentary loss of muscular control means werder will be without their playmaker until late february .
with striker claudio pizarro also banned , bremen 's title hopes may be dead and buried . games do n't get much costlier than bremen 's 1-0 defeat at karlsruhe last weekend .
not only did last year 's runners-up drop three points to what was then the worst team in the league but the team 's cool appeared to blow along with its title chances .
the german football federation , the dfb , has now also suspended playmaker diego , the motor of bremen 's offense , for four games after video footage showed him trying to strangle karlsruhe defender christian eichner .
one day before , on december 8 , the dfb banned striker claudio pizarro for three games for slapping karlruhe 's martin stoll in the dying minutes of the match .
bremen and the two players affected say they accept the suspensions - a wise decision considering that the prospects for a successful appeal would be next to none .
still two questions remain .
how did a perennial league powerhouse , which is currently tenth in the league , go so far off the rails ?
and what if anything can bremen do to get back on track ?
rogue electrons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has been the most irate season of schaaf 's tenure werder have astonished fans in recent years by consistently finishing in the top three despite losing key players to wealthier clubs almost every season .
much of the credit has to go to coach thomas schaaf 's finely honed team system .
but this season , key players have lost their heads instead of concentrating on their appointed roles .
in the 6th round , star defender per mertesacker earned a red card and a three-game ban for pulling down an opponent with a clear line to goal in bremen 's match against hoffenheim .
in round 12 , up-and-coming midfielder mesut oezil kicked out at a bochum player , for which he was also sent off and given an involuntarily three-round holiday .
with diego and pizarro now also relegated to the sidelines , much is being written about bremen 's implosion .
but that 's the wrong metaphor .
instead , bremen are suffering from a void at the heart of the team .
veteran midfielder torsten frings has been more concerned about feuding with germany coach joachim loew over his standing in the national squad than about leading bremen .
and daniel jensen , another player who has provided stability , has been out for most of the season with injury .
thus , bremen are more like an unstable atom then a dying star .
the nucleus has lost the pull to make the whole cohere , and the electrons are beginning to spin out of control .
tricky off-season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen could sure use a return to form by sanogo bremen had already said they would try to off-load some of their non-performers , including strikers boubacar sanogo and martin harnik , during the winter break .
but unless they want to write off this season , this long-term strategy may have to be modified to address some pressing needs .
not only will diego and pizarro have to be replaced .
hugo almeida could also now be out for some weeks with an injury so werder have to either buy a forward or rehabilitate one of those they already have .
bremen could also use a couple of stocking stuffers for their porous defense , but bringing in too much new talent could result in a glut , and further damage to team chemistry , when regulars return from injury and suspension .
werder are now eight points adrift of third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league .
with wolfsburg still to play this year , and three more league games to survive before the team is back to full strength , bremen could find itself too far back by march to mount a realistic challenge at the top three .
in any case , it 's going to be a precarious christmas this year for what was once the bundesliga 's most consistent club . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brendan fraser plays the lead role earnest beginnings funke started out as a kindergarten teacher and illustrator for children 's books in the german city of hamburg before her writing career took off .
three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .
adult can delight in the complex dialogue and try fiercely to pick out historical figures such as adolf hitler among the plot 's villains .
youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .
one such cg scene shows a desert sandstorm morphing into flesh and blood .
younger children meanwhile can hold their breath , just hoping good will win out over evil .

and like rowling , she has hooked huge numbers of adult readers worldwide along with the children and teens who relish the magic worlds of her novels .
funke 's smash-hit fantasies have sold 15 million copies worldwide and are showing no signs of slowing down .
the upcoming release of " inkheart " in cinemas looks set to mark a shift in the 49-year-old 's status from big to mega .
it took a while for the german literary world to begin taking funke seriously , but her books - she has now written more than 50 - are increasingly being discussed on high-brow book-review pages and in literary circles .
indeed anyone who enjoyed the harry potter or narnia series is likely to be a pushover for " inkheart , " in which mo folchart , played by us actor brendan fraser , unwittingly conjures literary villains into real life .
to fight the evildoer capricorn mo must travel the world with his daughter meggie , played by young british actress eliza hope bennett , who develops the same strange power as her father .
his eccentric sister elinor is played by british actress helen mirren .
the cast is expected in berlin for the world premiere tuesday evening at the plush potsdamer platz cinema , home of the berlin film festival .
the opening should serve as the perfect birthday present for funke , who turns 50 the next day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brendan fraser plays the lead role earnest beginnings funke started out as a kindergarten teacher and illustrator for children 's books in the german city of hamburg before her writing career took off .
three years ago she moved to the us with her two children and her late husband .
although she lives these days with daughter anna , 18 , and son ben , 14 , in los angeles , funke continues to write all her books in her mother tongue german .
" inkheart " and its sequels were translated into english by anthea bell .
knowing all too well how awry film adaptations of popular novels can be , funke insisted on keeping close control of the $ 60-million film project in her role as co-producer .
unlike many authors who fear money and celebrity will sully their talents , funke said she was accustomed to working with filmmakers and that many of her books had already been adapted for television and the big screen in her native germany .
one desire she was keen on fulfilling for the " inkheart " film was to see brendan fraser play mo , something she said she had decided on before the book was first published in 2003 .
funke concedes however that a lot of the detail in the book has vanished from director iain softley 's final product , which attempts to boil down 550-plus pages of action and drama into less than two hours of screen time .
film for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke envisioned fraser playing mo when she was writing ' inkheart ' funke 's books have created much fanfare over the years and the upcoming film is sure to appeal to audiences of all ages .
adult can delight in the complex dialogue and try fiercely to pick out historical figures such as adolf hitler among the plot 's villains .
youthful viewers of the film will enjoy the story 's action and magic , which have been enhanced using computer-generated effects .

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .

" the government has lost public confidence , " papandreou told pasok socialist party deputies .
" the only thing it can give this country is to depart ... to seek a public verdict so that the people can give a solution . "
three successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted across greece and left many athenians angry about the response of the government and police to the riots and their inability to stop the destruction .
within hours of the shooting , riots erupted throughout greece , starting from the capital athens and quickly spreading to the northern port city of thessaloniki , volos , thessalia and to the holiday islands of corfu and crete .

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .
a coroner 's report shows the boy was shot in the chest .
teachers lead mass demonstration against government schools and universities across the country closed their doors for three days and hundreds of teachers , university lecturers and students rallied in central athens .
around 2,000 protesters , led by the olme teachers ' union , marched on parliament carrying a large banner reading " assassins , the government is the culprit " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rioting has already caused widespread damage greece braced for more widespread protests and possible violence following the funeral .
the shooting was seen as the last straw by many young greeks whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment rate and low wages .
unemployment is pegged at over 7 per cent and nearly 20 per cent of greeks live below the poverty line , earning less than 600 euros -lrb- $ 775 -rrb- a month .

the main opposition socialist party leader george papandreou called on the government to resign in an effort to end the crisis .
" the government has lost public confidence , " papandreou told pasok socialist party deputies .
" the only thing it can give this country is to depart ... to seek a public verdict so that the people can give a solution . "
three successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted across greece and left many athenians angry about the response of the government and police to the riots and their inability to stop the destruction .
within hours of the shooting , riots erupted throughout greece , starting from the capital athens and quickly spreading to the northern port city of thessaloniki , volos , thessalia and to the holiday islands of corfu and crete .
almost every city across the country saw cars , buildings , banks and shops torched , looted or smashed .

karamanlis called a crisis cabinet meeting on monday night and held new meetings with president karolos papoulias and leaders of allied and opposition political parties on tuesday .
" we will tolerate no leniency in the attribution of responsibility , " the prime minister said after talks with the president .
papoulias meanwhile appealed for calm , calling on greeks to " honor alexis ' memory peacefully . "
the government , already in trouble over the state of the economy and a series of political scandals , has been strongly criticized over the havoc .
" the whole country was delivered to chaos by an irresponsible government , " the eleftherotypia daily said in an editorial tuesday .
the violence has showcased the organizational capacity of urban radicals and the failure of the government to crack down , critics said .

" this is not just a random incident , " said magda , a 27-year-old hotel worker who was participating in a leftwing demonstration in athens .
" it has to do with the role played by the security forces ... who enjoy impunity . "
lawyer dimitris beladis , who specializes in urban troubles , the killing " is the detonator of a sort of social explosion due to economic insecurity that affects many youths and those who are unemployed or badly paid . "

both want more flexibility . the one-day meeting came ahead of an eu climate change summit on december 11-12 , at which the bloc hopes to institute a system by 2013 to auction off permits for the right to emit carbon dioxide .
poland , which is heavily dependent on coal , has expressed serious reservations about the proposal as well as the bloc 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by twenty percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 .
it had even hinted at the possibility of vetoing such a deal , which it says would favor more established eu member states over newer ones .
merkel , who has vowed to resist any eu climate measures that would cut german jobs , said that she and her polish counterpart were basically on the same page on this issue .
" we have made a great step forward , " merkel told journalists after the meeting .
" the possibility of a veto has become smaller . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of eastern europe requires coal to meet its power needs tusk concurred with that assessment .
" neither poland nor germany are interested in a veto , " the polish prime minister said .

the columbus is on a round-the-world cruise and will pick up passengers in sallalah , oman after sailing through the gulf of aden with only a skeleton crew on board .
hapag-lloyd said the decision was unavoidable .
" the reason for this precautionary measure is the political situation in the gulf of aden , " the company said in its official statement .
" against the backdrop of the german foreign ministry 's travel advisory for the region , hapag lloyd cruises … is not allowing any ships with passengers on board to sail through the gulf of aden . "
the company said that it had asked the german navy for an armed escort but that its request had been denied .
the passengers will spend three days in dubai before continuing their journey .

last week , the german navy said it had foiled an attempted pirate attack on the cruise ship ms astor in the gulf of aden , after firing warning shots at the pirates ' vessel .
instances of piracy have increased dramatically in the gulf of aden of the coast of somalia in recent weeks .
pirates currently hold around a dozen ships , including saudi arabian oil supertanker , under their control .
operation atalanta is the first time the eu has taken joint naval action .

9 , in brussels is part of a larger eu climate plan that also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and reduce energy consumption by 20 percent over the next decade . eu leaders will fine tune the total package on thursday and friday at a bloc-wide summit . significantly , negotiators - including delegates from the 27 eu member states , the eu commission and the european parliament - also reached an agreement on the use of biofuels .
officials said the new law should stipulate that 10 percent of the eu 's total energy needs is supplied through plant-based biofuels . the issue of biofuel quotas has been a bone of contention with some environmental and humanitarian groups , which say over-zealous biofuel production could cause massive deforestation and lead to food shortages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are concerned biofuel production could lead to food shortages to take those concerns into account , eu officials and parliamentarians agreed to a set of rules aimed at making sure that only environmentally-friendly biofuels are counted towards the overall target . cross-border renewable projects in january , the european commission had proposed a law setting individual targets for each member state to boost its use of renewable energy as a way of meeting the overall eu target . tuesday 's agreement , while still needing ratification by eu member states and the full european parliament , gives a strong political impulse to that proposal . however , in deference to member states ' wishes , it also includes a number of clauses which would give those states credit for supporting renewable-energy projects in other countries .
italian investment , for example , could finance a wind power project in germany , or even outside the eu , and italy would still gain credit toward its national targets . the accord follows a separate agreement made last week to cut emissions in new cars starting in 2015 . effort sharing slammed green groups currently in poznan , poland , for a two-week un climate summit widely approved of the agreements made in brussels .
however , they were unhappy with one component of the plan , known as effort sharing . this part of the plan calls for energy reduction targets in sectors not covered by trading in carbon emissions , including agriculture , transport and private households . a coalition of environmental groups , climate action network , called effort sharing " a farce . " " this proposal , steered by the self-interest of eu member states , sets the bar far too low , " said the coalition , as quoted by afp news agency . opposition from some eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a strong coal tradition in much of europe the eu 's climate package has in recent weeks also come under fire from its member states that depend the most on coal . poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they 've also demanded the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states . in addition , italy has demanded that the climate goals be reviewed half-way , in 2014 , a move some say could threaten investment and jobs in alternative energy sectors . the final climate deal is set to be agreed thursday and friday at the brussels summit . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the hooded teenagers ran onto the streets and attacked banks , reports said .
meanwhile , in downtown athens , riot police attempted to fight back protestors as young as 10 years of age using tear gas to keep them from reaching the building .
many demonstrators could be seen hurling firebombs and pieces of marble , and torching barricades in front of parliament in a violent press that threatens to topple the government .
in other parts of the city , students attacked four police stations in nea smyrni while elsewhere around the country , students clashed with police on the holiday island of rhodes and in the northern city of thessaloniki and the western city of ioannina .
the funeral of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos took place before nearly 3,000 mourners , many of them teenagers who gathered to pay their last respects and lay wreaths .
grigoropoulos was allegedly among a group of youths that had thrown stones at a squad car in a district of athens that is known as a radical stronghold .
the policeman who fired the shots which killed him and his partner have been arrested .
a coroner 's report shows the boy was shot in the chest .
teachers lead mass demonstration against government schools and universities across the country closed their doors for three days and hundreds of teachers , university lecturers and students rallied in central athens .
around 2,000 protesters , led by the olme teachers ' union , marched on parliament carrying a large banner reading " assassins , the government is the culprit " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rioting has already caused widespread damage greece braced for more widespread protests and possible violence following the funeral .
the shooting was seen as the last straw by many young greeks whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment rate and low wages .
unemployment is pegged at over 7 per cent and nearly 20 per cent of greeks live below the poverty line , earning less than 600 euros -lrb- $ 775 -rrb- a month .
" everyone appears to have let our children down .
students have become more hostile towards us and to figures of authority , " said christos kittas , after resigning as the dean of athens university after rioting spread to campuses .
rioting , political pressure could bring down government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity measures of the government are unpopular public unrest has grown with the conservative government 's austerity measures , with unions regularly demonstrating against privatizations , pension reforms and the cost of living , and this latest incident could topple the unpopular conservative government .
the main opposition socialist party leader george papandreou called on the government to resign in an effort to end the crisis .
" the government has lost public confidence , " papandreou told pasok socialist party deputies .
" the only thing it can give this country is to depart ... to seek a public verdict so that the people can give a solution . "
three successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted across greece and left many athenians angry about the response of the government and police to the riots and their inability to stop the destruction .
within hours of the shooting , riots erupted throughout greece , starting from the capital athens and quickly spreading to the northern port city of thessaloniki , volos , thessalia and to the holiday islands of corfu and crete .
almost every city across the country saw cars , buildings , banks and shops torched , looted or smashed .
greek leaders ' calls for calm go unheeded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis vowed to crack down on the rioters greece 's president appealed for calm and prime minister costas karamanlis vowed to crack down on the unrest , but protesters again defied the government and there was new unrest in athens and other cities .
karamanlis called a crisis cabinet meeting on monday night and held new meetings with president karolos papoulias and leaders of allied and opposition political parties on tuesday .
" we will tolerate no leniency in the attribution of responsibility , " the prime minister said after talks with the president .
papoulias meanwhile appealed for calm , calling on greeks to " honor alexis ' memory peacefully . "
the government , already in trouble over the state of the economy and a series of political scandals , has been strongly criticized over the havoc .
" the whole country was delivered to chaos by an irresponsible government , " the eleftherotypia daily said in an editorial tuesday .
the violence has showcased the organizational capacity of urban radicals and the failure of the government to crack down , critics said .
public anger aimed at " outlaw " police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the greek police act like they 're above the law many of the protesters say that the killing of grigoropoulos was the latest example of police acting as if they were above the law .
" this is not just a random incident , " said magda , a 27-year-old hotel worker who was participating in a leftwing demonstration in athens .
" it has to do with the role played by the security forces ... who enjoy impunity . "
lawyer dimitris beladis , who specializes in urban troubles , the killing " is the detonator of a sort of social explosion due to economic insecurity that affects many youths and those who are unemployed or badly paid . "
abroad , demonstrators attempted to take over the greek embassies in london and cyprus .
in the german capital berlin , protesters describing themselves as anarchists invaded the greek consulate on monday .
more than 60 people reportedly stormed the greek embassy in paris on tuesday .
german police investigate sympathetic anarchists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are investigating anarchist links german police were investigating damage done by anarchists in the eastern city of dresden during an overnight protest linked to the athens riots on tuesday .
between 20 and 30 black-clad sympathizers with the greek anarchists first handed out leaflets .
some of the group then tipped rubbish bins onto city streets , knocked over building-site fences and smashed a police-car windscreen .
police were seeking to identify them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the people of sark prepare to embrace democracy on wednesday , with its first elected government for more than four centuries , there were certain early pointers .
travel arrangements to the tiny island , situated about 25 miles -lrb- 40km -rrb- from the french coast , gave the first hint with the discovery it was possible to fly to the neighbouring island of guernsey , but from there the only means of transport was by boat - the following day .
an e-mail from a work colleague at bbc guernsey provided a few more clues - and raised some nervous flutters - as it offered a list of bicycle hire shops .
there are no cars , no buses and definitely no taxis or black cabs on sark , so covering the island has to be done on two wheels or two feet .
' toast rack ' a good torch was the next " must have " - sark has no street lighting and in mid-december daylight hours are at a premium .
a later e-mail reinforced its importance - a search party had to be sent out for a journalist lost in the dark .
the lack of street lights was not so surprising , however , as the island does not really have an abundance of streets , roads or pavements .
what it has are lanes and paths aplenty , which , when it rains , can become somewhat muddy - thereby explaining why " wellies " or stout walking boots were also required .
passengers disembarking on sark from the little ferry are transported to the village in the " toast rack " - a tractor-drawn carrier .
you show me a law that says you can beat your wife and i 'll show you a newer law that calls it assault lt col reg guille , sark seneschal little appears to have changed since hellier de carteret , a jersey nobleman , was granted a fiefdom -lrb- inherited land -rrb- from queen elizabeth i in 1565 .
this gave the seigneur -lrb- lord -rrb- the right to colonise sark with 40 families in exchange for guarding the island from pirates .
more than 400 years later , seigneur michael beaumont has retained that right by taking an oath of allegiance to the queen and by paying the british crown his annual feudal rent equal to one-twentieth of a knight 's pay - £ 1.79 .
to this day , he and the descendants of the original 40 tenants are theoretically required to keep a musket to defend sark , although , in reality , britain is responsible for sark 's defence .
as head of the island , the seigneur continues to have other privileges dating back for centuries , including the right to be the only person on sark who is allowed to keep doves and pigeons or an unspayed dog .
there is also a colombier -lrb- dove cote -rrb- at his 17th century home , known as the seigneurie , but mr beaumont does not have an unspayed dog .
the island 's leafy paths and lanes have no street lights frequently asked by inquisitive visitors about droit de seigneur -lrb- sleeping with a bride on her wedding night -rrb- , the seigneur 's standard reply is that it would get him into trouble .
nor , he has said , does he exercise a sarkee husband 's right to beat his wife with a stick no broader than his finger .
as lt col reg guille , the seneschal -lrb- senior judge -rrb- pointed out : " you show me a law that says you can beat your wife and i 'll show you a newer law that calls it assault . "
one ancient right all sarkees can invoke if they believe their property is being threatened is the clameur de haro .
by falling to their knees in front of witnesses , they can recite the lord 's prayer in french then cry out for justice : " haro , haro , haro !
a mon aide mon prince , on me fait tort ! "
-lrb- help me , my prince , i have been wronged -rrb- .
if the clameur is registered with the greffe -lrb- court -rrb- , the alleged wrong must stop until it is dealt with by the court .
the seneschal said he had dealt with only one clameur in 1999 , but they almost always involve a boundary dispute .
unknown future " it 's a very immediate form of justice .
if someone 's putting a wall up where they should n't be , the clameur stops it , " he said .
the island has a breathtakingly beautiful and unspoilt charm and its inhabitants appear welcoming and friendly - most waving a cheery " hello " to friends and strangers alike as they whizz past on their bicycles .
services taken for granted on the mainland , including the police , fire service and the government , are mostly done on an unpaid voluntary basis by sarkees from a sense of responsibility to each other .
to outsiders , sark 's way of life may be described as quaint , quirky or old-fashioned , but , for the island 's inhabitants , it has suited them very well for nearly 450 years .
only time will tell whether the historic move to a democratic future on wednesday might change that .

as the people of sark prepare to embrace democracy on wednesday , with its first elected government for more than four centuries , there were certain early pointers .
travel arrangements to the tiny island , situated about 25 miles -lrb- 40km -rrb- from the french coast , gave the first hint with the discovery it was possible to fly to the neighbouring island of guernsey , but from there the only means of transport was by boat - the following day .
an e-mail from a work colleague at bbc guernsey provided a few more clues - and raised some nervous flutters - as it offered a list of bicycle hire shops .
there are no cars , no buses and definitely no taxis or black cabs on sark , so covering the island has to be done on two wheels or two feet .
' toast rack ' a good torch was the next " must have " - sark has no street lighting and in mid-december daylight hours are at a premium .
a later e-mail reinforced its importance - a search party had to be sent out for a journalist lost in the dark .
the lack of street lights was not so surprising , however , as the island does not really have an abundance of streets , roads or pavements .
what it has are lanes and paths aplenty , which , when it rains , can become somewhat muddy - thereby explaining why " wellies " or stout walking boots were also required .
passengers disembarking on sark from the little ferry are transported to the village in the " toast rack " - a tractor-drawn carrier .
you show me a law that says you can beat your wife and i 'll show you a newer law that calls it assault lt col reg guille , sark seneschal little appears to have changed since hellier de carteret , a jersey nobleman , was granted a fiefdom -lrb- inherited land -rrb- from queen elizabeth i in 1565 .
this gave the seigneur -lrb- lord -rrb- the right to colonise sark with 40 families in exchange for guarding the island from pirates .
more than 400 years later , seigneur michael beaumont has retained that right by taking an oath of allegiance to the queen and by paying the british crown his annual feudal rent equal to one-twentieth of a knight 's pay - £ 1.79 .
to this day , he and the descendants of the original 40 tenants are theoretically required to keep a musket to defend sark , although , in reality , britain is responsible for sark 's defence .
as head of the island , the seigneur continues to have other privileges dating back for centuries , including the right to be the only person on sark who is allowed to keep doves and pigeons or an unspayed dog .
there is also a colombier -lrb- dove cote -rrb- at his 17th century home , known as the seigneurie , but mr beaumont does not have an unspayed dog .
the island 's leafy paths and lanes have no street lights frequently asked by inquisitive visitors about droit de seigneur -lrb- sleeping with a bride on her wedding night -rrb- , the seigneur 's standard reply is that it would get him into trouble .
nor , he has said , does he exercise a sarkee husband 's right to beat his wife with a stick no broader than his finger .
as lt col reg guille , the seneschal -lrb- senior judge -rrb- pointed out : " you show me a law that says you can beat your wife and i 'll show you a newer law that calls it assault . "
one ancient right all sarkees can invoke if they believe their property is being threatened is the clameur de haro .
by falling to their knees in front of witnesses , they can recite the lord 's prayer in french then cry out for justice : " haro , haro , haro !
a mon aide mon prince , on me fait tort ! "
-lrb- help me , my prince , i have been wronged -rrb- .
if the clameur is registered with the greffe -lrb- court -rrb- , the alleged wrong must stop until it is dealt with by the court .
the seneschal said he had dealt with only one clameur in 1999 , but they almost always involve a boundary dispute .
unknown future " it 's a very immediate form of justice .
if someone 's putting a wall up where they should n't be , the clameur stops it , " he said .
the island has a breathtakingly beautiful and unspoilt charm and its inhabitants appear welcoming and friendly - most waving a cheery " hello " to friends and strangers alike as they whizz past on their bicycles .
services taken for granted on the mainland , including the police , fire service and the government , are mostly done on an unpaid voluntary basis by sarkees from a sense of responsibility to each other .
to outsiders , sark 's way of life may be described as quaint , quirky or old-fashioned , but , for the island 's inhabitants , it has suited them very well for nearly 450 years .
only time will tell whether the historic move to a democratic future on wednesday might change that .

it was popular with generations of children who loved both its strangeness and the reassuring warmth of postgate 's voice-overs .
oliver postgate was born in north london in 1925 .
he was the grandson of the labour mp george lansbury and inherited many of his principles , risking prison as a conscientious objector during the second world war .
he was later to be active in the campaign against nuclear weapons , addressing public meetings and writing pamphlets .
he went into partnership with peter firmin , forming the production company smallfilms .
it was just that ; a two-man operation making short animated films from a makeshift studio in a disused cowshed in kent .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement highlights from some of postgate 's work including bagpuss , ivor the engine and the clangers they started in 1959 with ivor the engine , a series for itv about a little welsh steam engine who wanted to sing in a choir -lrb- it was remade in colour for the bbc in the 1970s -rrb- .
they were simple stories and simple animations , no more than cardboard cut-outs .
firmin did the artwork , postgate wrote the scripts , did the filming and many of the voices , in rather dodgy welsh accents .
they produced two minutes of film a day , ten times as much as a conventional animation studio , with postgate moving the cardboard pieces himself , and working his 16mm camera frame-by-frame with a home-made clicker .
early films like ivor the engine relied on cardboard cut outs ivor was followed in the early 1960s by the sagas of noggin the nog for the bbc .
noggin was the baby-faced king of the race of nogs , norsemen who lived in the chilly north .
there was his villainous uncle nogbad the bad ; a sensible talking bird , graculus ; and a court inventor , olaf the lofty .
his adventures were sometimes alarming , sometimes charming , and eventually ran to five series -lrb- some of those , too , were remade in colour many years later -rrb- .
by now postgate and firmin were established as reliable purveyors of children 's entertainment , in the days when there were just two channels and children 's television occupied a privileged teatime slot on both .
it was a gentlemanly and rather innocent business , as postgate later described .
" we would go to the bbc once a year , show them the films we 'd made , and they would say , ' yes , lovely , now what are you going to do next ? " '
" we would tell them , and they would say , ' that sounds fine , we 'll mark it in for eighteen months from now ' , and we would be given praise and encouragement and some money in advance , and we 'd just go away and do it . "
the clangers saw postgate 's surreal imagination in overdrive in 1963 they branched out into stop-motion puppet animation , first with the pingwings and then with the pogles .
the pingwings were knitted penguin puppets who lived in firmin 's barn while the pogles lived in a tree-root in a wood .
the first pogles series , in which they encountered a witch , was deemed a little too scary ; later series , under the new title of pogles wood , were gentler .
the arrival of colour television spurred the team to new heights of invention .
their work took on a decidedly surreal edge with the clangers , pink creatures with pointed noses who lived on a blue moon with a friendly soup dragon , and spoke in whistles .
postgate and another actor did their voices with swanee whistles , after postgate had painstakingly written out every word of the script .
the original dialogue was virtually indecipherable , which did n't stop postgate getting into trouble when a bbc executive correctly divined that for one clanger he 'd written the line : " oh sod it , the bloody thing wo n't open " .
the clangers were perhaps postgate and firmin 's finest achievement though not , apparently , their most popular .
postgate did the script and voices while firmin made the artwork that honour went to bagpuss , a pink and white striped cat , who presided over a shop dedicated to mending broken articles .
each episode featured a different object , along with a ragdoll , a pompous mechanical bird called professor yaffle -lrb- whose catchphrase was " fiddlesticks and flapdoodle ! " -rrb- and a bunch of industrious but occasionally mutinous mice who did most of the repair work .
bagpuss made his first appearance in 1974 , and was repeated endlessly until 1987 despite the fact that only 13 episodes were ever made .
have your say oliver postgate 's work was a big part of my childhood .
noggin the nog , the clangers , brilliant , inspired stuff ian barker , bolton send us your comments bbc management declined to commission any more bagpuss stories in the mistaken belief that children found puppets too old fashioned .
in 1998 -lrb- by which time the bagpuss generation had reached their 20s and early 30s -rrb- the programme was voted the best children 's series ever in a television poll .
oliver postgate made his last film in 1987 , complaining that children 's television commissioners were no longer interested in what he had to offer .
with his story-telling skills , his love of found objects and mechanical improvisation , his funny voices and air of eccentricity , the man himself gave a good imitation of everyone 's favourite uncle .
and his creations live on , at once surreal and comforting .

it was popular with generations of children who loved both its strangeness and the reassuring warmth of postgate 's voice-overs .
oliver postgate was born in north london in 1925 .
he was the grandson of the labour mp george lansbury and inherited many of his principles , risking prison as a conscientious objector during the second world war .
he was later to be active in the campaign against nuclear weapons , addressing public meetings and writing pamphlets .
he went into partnership with peter firmin , forming the production company smallfilms .
it was just that ; a two-man operation making short animated films from a makeshift studio in a disused cowshed in kent .

advertisement highlights from some of postgate 's work including bagpuss , ivor the engine and the clangers they started in 1959 with ivor the engine , a series for itv about a little welsh steam engine who wanted to sing in a choir -lrb- it was remade in colour for the bbc in the 1970s -rrb- .
they were simple stories and simple animations , no more than cardboard cut-outs .
firmin did the artwork , postgate wrote the scripts , did the filming and many of the voices , in rather dodgy welsh accents .
they produced two minutes of film a day , ten times as much as a conventional animation studio , with postgate moving the cardboard pieces himself , and working his 16mm camera frame-by-frame with a home-made clicker .
early films like ivor the engine relied on cardboard cut outs ivor was followed in the early 1960s by the sagas of noggin the nog for the bbc .
noggin was the baby-faced king of the race of nogs , norsemen who lived in the chilly north .
there was his villainous uncle nogbad the bad ; a sensible talking bird , graculus ; and a court inventor , olaf the lofty .
his adventures were sometimes alarming , sometimes charming , and eventually ran to five series -lrb- some of those , too , were remade in colour many years later -rrb- .
by now postgate and firmin were established as reliable purveyors of children 's entertainment , in the days when there were just two channels and children 's television occupied a privileged teatime slot on both .
it was a gentlemanly and rather innocent business , as postgate later described .
" we would go to the bbc once a year , show them the films we 'd made , and they would say , ' yes , lovely , now what are you going to do next ? " '
" we would tell them , and they would say , ' that sounds fine , we 'll mark it in for eighteen months from now ' , and we would be given praise and encouragement and some money in advance , and we 'd just go away and do it . "
the clangers saw postgate 's surreal imagination in overdrive in 1963 they branched out into stop-motion puppet animation , first with the pingwings and then with the pogles .
the pingwings were knitted penguin puppets who lived in firmin 's barn while the pogles lived in a tree-root in a wood .
the first pogles series , in which they encountered a witch , was deemed a little too scary ; later series , under the new title of pogles wood , were gentler .
the arrival of colour television spurred the team to new heights of invention .
their work took on a decidedly surreal edge with the clangers , pink creatures with pointed noses who lived on a blue moon with a friendly soup dragon , and spoke in whistles .
postgate and another actor did their voices with swanee whistles , after postgate had painstakingly written out every word of the script .
the original dialogue was virtually indecipherable , which did n't stop postgate getting into trouble when a bbc executive correctly divined that for one clanger he 'd written the line : " oh sod it , the bloody thing wo n't open " .
the clangers were perhaps postgate and firmin 's finest achievement though not , apparently , their most popular .
postgate did the script and voices while firmin made the artwork that honour went to bagpuss , a pink and white striped cat , who presided over a shop dedicated to mending broken articles .
each episode featured a different object , along with a ragdoll , a pompous mechanical bird called professor yaffle -lrb- whose catchphrase was " fiddlesticks and flapdoodle ! " -rrb- and a bunch of industrious but occasionally mutinous mice who did most of the repair work .
bagpuss made his first appearance in 1974 , and was repeated endlessly until 1987 despite the fact that only 13 episodes were ever made .

however , 11 ni premises processed pork from the republic and the meat was put on sale in northern ireland .
the agency has advised retailers and consumers that any pork products bought since 1 september should not be eaten .
however , it is hopeful that pork sales can start in northern ireland again in a day or two .
almost 1,400 pork processing workers in the republic of ireland have been laid off following the contamination scare .
pork products from the republic were recalled over fears that pig feed at an animal meal plant was tainted with oil containing potentially harmful dioxins .
it said it believed no pigs in northern ireland had consumed the tainted feed but advised retailers and caterers to " temporarily remove products manufactured in northern ireland from sale until they can satisfy themselves that these products do n't contain pork sourced from the republic of ireland after 1 september " .
eleven businesses in northern ireland had received pork from the republic which was processed and placed on sale locally , it added .
' low risk ' the food standards agency said adverse health effects were " only likely if people are exposed to relatively high levels of this contaminant for long periods " .
dr andrew wadge , director of food safety , said they were ensuring pork from affected farms was removed from shops .
" if anyone 's not clear about where the product comes from - they 've got it in their fridge or in their freezer - then our advice is to take that back to the point of purchase and get a refund , " he said .
although the risk is said to be low , people are advised not to eat any irish pork and the health scare has had a devastating effect for the pork industry on both sides of the border .
the trade union siptu has warned as many as 6,000 jobs are at risk in the republic 's pork industry , estimated to be worth £ 350m a year .
at the largest pig processor in the republic , county offaly-based rosderra meats , 850 workers have been laid off and a further 650 put on protective notice .
in northern ireland , 26,000 pigs are processed every week but major firms halted slaughtering on monday and a backlog is building up on farms .
twelve european union countries and nine non-eu countries have been affected by the scare .

the un-appointed prosecutor asked judges to intervene after he and his cambodian counterpart were unable to move forward .
it is the first time that international and cambodian officials have had a public disagreement since the tribunal started two years ago .
the court is looking into the deaths of some two million people in the 1970s .
who were the khmer rouge ?
maoist regime that ruled cambodia from 1975-1979 founded and led by pol pot , who died in 1998 abolished religion , schools and currency in a bid to create agrarian utopia up to two million people thought to have died from starvation , overwork or execution brutal khmer rouge regime the filing of an official " statement of disagreement " suggests the tribunal may have a serious problem .
five former khmer rouge leaders are in custody awaiting trial on charges of crimes against humanity .
and international co-prosecutor robert petit believes several more people should be investigated .
but he has been unable to convince his cambodian colleague , chea leang .
and asking the judges to intervene indicates that any attempts to reach a compromise have failed .
embarrassment there has always been the potential for the tribunal to hit such a problem .
although it is backed by the united nations , it is actually a cambodian court .
and the government 's enthusiasm for the process has frequently been called into question .
many senior figures in the current administration were themselves formerly members of the khmer rouge .
and as the number of prosecutions rises , so does the chance of embarrassment - or worse - for people in high places .
but organisations monitoring the tribunal have said that proceeding with more cases is vital for the court 's credibility .

damage to hair cells in the inner ear due to ageing and overstimulation causes hearing problems in 10 % of people worldwide .
the cell loss is irreversible , but us scientists believe it may be possible to replace them with stem cells from a region of the brain .
the study appears in proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
there might be questions as to whether taking cells from the brain to replace inner ear hair cells would prove clinically acceptable professor andy forge ucl ear institute the key ependymal cells come from the lining of the lateral ventricle of the brain .
they share characteristics with inner ear hair cells - but crucially , unlike them , they have the ability to reproduce .
the researchers , led by dr dongguang wei , from the university of california at davis , believe the brain cells could potentially be transplanted from a person 's brain into their ear , where they would take on the role of hair cells , and restore hearing .
nerve cells loss of inner ear hair cells often also leads to breakdown of the nerve cells along which the signals they generate are transmitted to the brain .
the researchers believe these spiral ganglion cells can also be replaced - this time by stem cells from another area of the brain 's lateral ventricle .
their conclusions are based on a detailed analysis of the structure , chemistry and role of the brain cells .
tests of the theory are already underway in the laboratory .
and they believe the cells also hold out hope for use in the treatment of diseases of the nervous system .
professor andy forge , of the university college london ear institute , said previous work had suggested that the inner ear might have a small number of stem cells of its own which might be able to replace damaged hair cells .
others are working on using embryonic stem cells to achieve the same effect .
the latest paper raised the possibility of a third potential source of cells .
professor forge said : " the present paper identifies a possible single tissue source for both the elements that may be lost from the damaged sensory tissues of the inner ear .
" however , there might be questions as to whether taking cells from the brain to replace inner ear hair cells would prove clinically acceptable . "
dr mark downs , of the charity rnid , said nine million people in the uk alone were deaf or hard of hearing , but much work was underway into developing restorative treatments .
he said : " there is a long way to go .
this research is still at a very early stage and but the future looks increasingly brighter for people with hearing loss . "

damage to hair cells in the inner ear due to ageing and overstimulation causes hearing problems in 10 % of people worldwide .
the cell loss is irreversible , but us scientists believe it may be possible to replace them with stem cells from a region of the brain .
the study appears in proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
there might be questions as to whether taking cells from the brain to replace inner ear hair cells would prove clinically acceptable professor andy forge ucl ear institute the key ependymal cells come from the lining of the lateral ventricle of the brain .
they share characteristics with inner ear hair cells - but crucially , unlike them , they have the ability to reproduce .
the researchers , led by dr dongguang wei , from the university of california at davis , believe the brain cells could potentially be transplanted from a person 's brain into their ear , where they would take on the role of hair cells , and restore hearing .
nerve cells loss of inner ear hair cells often also leads to breakdown of the nerve cells along which the signals they generate are transmitted to the brain .
the researchers believe these spiral ganglion cells can also be replaced - this time by stem cells from another area of the brain 's lateral ventricle .
their conclusions are based on a detailed analysis of the structure , chemistry and role of the brain cells .
tests of the theory are already underway in the laboratory .
and they believe the cells also hold out hope for use in the treatment of diseases of the nervous system .
professor andy forge , of the university college london ear institute , said previous work had suggested that the inner ear might have a small number of stem cells of its own which might be able to replace damaged hair cells .
others are working on using embryonic stem cells to achieve the same effect .
the latest paper raised the possibility of a third potential source of cells .
professor forge said : " the present paper identifies a possible single tissue source for both the elements that may be lost from the damaged sensory tissues of the inner ear .
" however , there might be questions as to whether taking cells from the brain to replace inner ear hair cells would prove clinically acceptable . "
dr mark downs , of the charity rnid , said nine million people in the uk alone were deaf or hard of hearing , but much work was underway into developing restorative treatments .

young people have been clashing with police in cities across greece the riots that have swept greece for the past two days and look set to continue for the foreseeable future underline why the most important day in the national calendar is " oxi " or " no " day .
" oxi " day commemorates 28 october 1940 , when greek leader ioannis metaxas used that single word to reply to mussolini 's ultimatum to allow italy to invade greece , propelling his nation into world war ii .
when greeks say no , they mean it in spades .
rebellion is deeply embedded in the greek psyche .
the students and school children who are now laying siege to police stations and trying to bring down the government are undergoing a rite of passage .
they may be the ipod generation , but they are the inheritors of a tradition that goes back centuries , when nuns would rather hurl themselves to death from mountain convents than submit to the ravages of greece 's turkish ottoman invaders .
' springboards for violence ' the centre for this december rebellion is the athens polytechnic , where students have been out on the streets with wheelbarrows and shopping trolleys to collect and recycle rocks and pieces of marble used in the previous night 's assaults .
the violence began in athens and then spread to thessaloniki the polytechnic is the symbol of modern rebellion .
on 17 november 1973 , tanks of the then six-year-old military dictatorship burst through the iron railings to suppress a student uprising against the colonels .
the exact casualty figure is still unknown to this day but it is believed that around 40 people were killed .
the sacrifice of the polytechnic was so significant that the post-junta architects of greece 's new constitution drafted the right of asylum , which bans the authorities from entering the grounds of schools and universities .
that is why places of learning are the springboards for the current wave of violence and it also explains why many of the riots are in university towns .
students and pupils have effectively been given carte blanche to carry on protesting , because their professors have declared a three-day strike .
' out of control ' although many of today 's protestors were not born when the polytechnic gates were crushed by the tanks , the lesson of the students ' martyrdom is a key component of every greek child 's school democracy curriculum .
if greece had already appeared difficult to govern , it will now will be out of control nikos konstandaras , managing editor of kathimerini newspaper the latent greek contempt for the police , which has now erupted so volcanically , has its roots in the dictatorship , when the police were regarded as the colonels ' enforcers and traitors to the people .
the death of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos at the hands of an experienced 37-year-old policeman has precipitated a wave of nationwide violence unseen since the dictatorship .
whether it will lead to the fall of the unpopular conservative government of prime minister kostas karamanlis is unclear .
it is premature to see the troubles as greece 's reprise of the paris uprising of 1968 .
one of the wisest observations has come from nikos konstandaras , the managing editor of kathimerini , one of greece 's more sober and respected newspapers .
in an editorial entitled " anger 's teen martyr " , mr konstandaras wrote that mr grioropoulos ' blood would be " used to bind together every disparate protest and complaint into a platform of righteous rage against all the ills of our society .
" it will quickly become a flag of convenience for anyone who has a grudge against the state , the government , the economic system , foreign powers , capitalism and so on . "
" if greece had already appeared difficult to govern , it will now be out of control . "

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- rebellion deeply embedded in greece bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 08:18 gmt , tuesday , 9 december 2008 rebellion deeply embedded in greece the bbc 's malcolm brabant looks at why student anger has erupted across greece over saturday 's fatal police shooting of a teenage boy .
the riots that have swept greece for the past two days and look set to continue for the foreseeable future underline why the most important day in the national calendar is " oxi " or " no " day .
" oxi " day commemorates 28 october 1940 , when greek leader ioannis metaxas used that single word to reply to mussolini 's ultimatum to allow italy to invade greece , propelling his nation into world war ii .
when greeks say no , they mean it in spades .
rebellion is deeply embedded in the greek psyche .
the students and school children who are now laying siege to police stations and trying to bring down the government are undergoing a rite of passage .
they may be the ipod generation , but they are the inheritors of a tradition that goes back centuries , when nuns would rather hurl themselves to death from mountain convents than submit to the ravages of greece 's turkish ottoman invaders .
' springboards for violence ' the centre for this december rebellion is the athens polytechnic , where students have been out on the streets with wheelbarrows and shopping trolleys to collect and recycle rocks and pieces of marble used in the previous night 's assaults .
the polytechnic is the symbol of modern rebellion .
on 17 november 1973 , tanks of the then six-year-old military dictatorship burst through the iron railings to suppress a student uprising against the colonels .
the exact casualty figure is still unknown to this day but it is believed that around 40 people were killed .
the sacrifice of the polytechnic was so significant that the post-junta architects of greece 's new constitution drafted the right of asylum , which bans the authorities from entering the grounds of schools and universities .
that is why places of learning are the springboards for the current wave of violence and it also explains why many of the riots are in university towns .
students and pupils have effectively been given carte blanche to carry on protesting , because their professors have declared a three-day strike .
' out of control ' although many of today 's protestors were not born when the polytechnic gates were crushed by the tanks , the lesson of the students ' martyrdom is a key component of every greek child 's school democracy curriculum . "
if greece had already appeared difficult to govern , it will now will be out of control " nikos konstandaras , managing editor of kathimerini newspaper the latent greek contempt for the police , which has now erupted so volcanically , has its roots in the dictatorship , when the police were regarded as the colonels ' enforcers and traitors to the people .
the death of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos at the hands of an experienced 37-year-old policeman has precipitated a wave of nationwide violence unseen since the dictatorship .
whether it will lead to the fall of the unpopular conservative government of prime minister kostas karamanlis is unclear .
it is premature to see the troubles as greece 's reprise of the paris uprising of 1968 .
one of the wisest observations has come from nikos konstandaras , the managing editor of kathimerini , one of greece 's more sober and respected newspapers .
in an editorial entitled " anger 's teen martyr " , mr konstandaras wrote that mr grioropoulos ' blood would be " used to bind together every disparate protest and complaint into a platform of righteous rage against all the ills of our society .
" it will quickly become a flag of convenience for anyone who has a grudge against the state , the government , the economic system , foreign powers , capitalism and so on . "
" if greece had already appeared difficult to govern , it will now be out of control . "

but plans for an outright ban on tobacco vending machines and branding on cigarette packets have been scrapped - at least for now .
ministers hope the display ban , which is also under consideration in scotland , will reduce smoking .
northern ireland is yet to decide a policy .
critics say the moves do not go far enough to stop young people smoking .
a government consultation on how to deter young people from smoking launched six months ago found the " overwhelming majority " of 100,000 responses backed the display ban . "
we expect nothing less than a robust tobacco control plan which includes a total ban on cigarette vending machines " british heart foundation tobacco store fears lessons from abroad health secretary for england alan johnson said he had been impressed with evidence from other countries , suggesting the move would have an impact on smoking rates .
ministers say where other countries - such as iceland and canada - have removed displays , smoking prevalence among young people has fallen by up to 10 % .
alan johnson said : " they see the point of sale display and as a result of seeing it , it encourages them to take up smoking .
this is the key evidence as to why we have 200,000 11 to 15-year-olds smoking . "
from the today programme more from today programme he said people who start smoking in their youth - aged 11 to 15 - are three times more likely to die a premature death than someone who takes up smoking at the age of 20 .
they are also more likely to be hooked for life .
deborah arnott , director of the anti-smoking group ash , backed the ban and said the prohibition of the display of tobacco products at point of sale would be " a proportionate response to the death and disease caused by tobacco " .
england 's chief medical officer , professor sir liam donaldson , called the move " another step on the road to victory on tobacco-related illness . "
from the today programme more from today programme liberal democrat shadow health secretary norman lamb said it was " the nanny state going too far . "
simon clark , director of the smokers ' lobby group forest , said a display ban would inconvenience millions of consumers .
" it 's gesture politics , designed to denormalise adults who wish to purchase and consume a perfectly legal product . "
the tobacco manufacturers ' association also opposes the cigarette display ban and says it could have serious unintended consequences , such as driving the sale of illicit tobacco .
it could also damage the income of smaller shops that rely heavily on tobacco sales , said the tma 's chief executive mr chris ogden .
mr johnson said the big supermarkets would be asked first to remove their displays - in 2011 - followed by corner shops - in 2013 .
restricting access he said other plans had been scrapped as a result of the consultation - such as getting rid of 10-pack cigarettes .
only selling cigarettes in packs of 20 might drive people who are trying to quit to smoke more , he said .
but mr johnson said they would clamp down on underage sales from cigarette sales vending machines - people wanting to buy these cigarettes will have to show proof of age to obtain a token to work the machine .
if this does n't work , mr johnson said they had the power to ban vending machines altogether .
the british heart foundation says a total ban on vending machines is the only way to prevent children accessing cigarettes .
vending machines are the source of cigarettes for nearly one in five young smokers aged 11 to 15 - some 46,000 children .
have your say " let 's face it - illegal drugs flourish without advertising or display .

the british lung foundation agreed , saying : " nearly three quarters of people with lung disease tell us that they believe there should be a total ban on cigarette vending machines as they are the main source of cigarettes to young smokers . "
dr vivienne nathanson of the british medical association said : " we hope the proposals to make vending machines ' child-proof ' will be rigidly enforced and that if they do not work then this issue will be revisited by ministers . "
the government had also considered banning all promotional material from tobacco packaging .
but ministers say until there is enough evidence such a move would actually stop young people taking up smoking it will not introduce a ban .
