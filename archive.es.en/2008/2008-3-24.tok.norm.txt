big business moves into a pristine wilderness and starts destroying the environment and by turn the livelihoods of the indigenous people who live there .
but in a reversal of plot , there are now cases of people living traditional lifestyles who are now invading the territory of the big companies and taking them on at their own game .
the story of the achuar tribe living in the amazon rainforest of north-eastern peru is one of them .
last year , they filed a class action lawsuit against oil giant occidental petroleum , in los angeles .
now they are awaiting a judge 's decision on whether the case can proceed in the us or will be sent back to peru , where it stands little chance of coming to court .
' no credible data the achuar people , who have lived for thousands of years in the rainforest , allege that the company contaminated their territory during more than 30 years of oil drilling , making their people sick , even causing some to die , and damaging their land and livelihoods beyond repair .
occidental petroleum , which pulled out of peru eight years ago , denies liability in the case .
oil spills are still found , the achuar say it has responded , saying : " we are aware of no credible data of negative community health impacts resulting from occidental 's operations in peru . "
the oil bonanza began in peru almost 40 years ago when many foreign companies were given an open invitation by successive governments to test and drill in the amazon .
what they did not consider was the devastating impact it would have on the native people , principally the achuar - their land , their livelihood and their health .
the achuar 's spiritual leader , tomas maynas , wears a bright red headdress made of toucan feathers , and has red war paint streaked on his face .
he is the plaintiff in the suit against the company .
he remembers how everything changed when the oil companies arrived .
he says the animals ran away , the fish died and their crops started to wilt .
a whole generation had their health damaged .
how can we keep quiet as our parents did petronila chumpi " the peruvian state just wants to extract as much oil as they can from our land .
they 've made millions of dollars but we have n't seen it here .
" we know there 's wealth here and there 'll be more drilling so the state will keep on killing us .
but sometimes , when there is pressure , the state gives in . "
the lawsuit alleges occidental petroleum ignored industry standards and employed out-of-date practices , dumping around 9bn barrels of toxic waste water into streams and rivers over 30 years .
after occidental left , its operations were taken over by pluspetrol .
pluspetrol agreed to change practices in late 2006 when the achuar , after repeated attempts to negotiate , took direct action .
shotguns and spears many of the older achuar men once fought in tribal wars with their neighbours , now they finally had the chance to hit their elusive new enemies where it hurt - in their pockets .
peacefully , yet armed with shotguns and spears , they occupied and held the amazon oil wells in october 2006 .
the ecosystem is the genetic bank of the amazon ... that is our capital , the genetic bank that we have to preserve for humanity , and for the world ivan vasquez loreto regional president the government and the company , losing millions of dollars a day , were forced to come to the negotiating table .
the achuar came away with a commitment from pluspetrol to reduce contamination and to pay millions of dollars to clean up and establish a 10-year health plan .
it was thanks to help from outside but also a new generation of indigenous leaders who are learning how to protect their rights in the modern world .
" a whole generation had their health damaged .
how can we keep quiet as our parents did ? " asks 29-year-old petronila chumpi .
" we ca n't allow this , we 're a new generation , we know how to read and write and we have to help our people because they did n't have the knowledge to defend themselves against the oil companies .
but now we do . "
improvement even on a fast motorboat , trompeteros is a long day 's journey up three rain-swollen rivers from loreto 's regional capital , iquitos .
a hamlet of some 3,000 people , it is situated right opposite block eight , one of the main oil wells .
the achuar have lived in the region for thousands of years local people say there is still contamination and oil spills , but now the achuar have gps transceivers to log the problems where they find them .
little by little there are signs of improvement .
but there is frustration on the part of pluspetrol , which has pledged to pay millions of dollars , that the government is not playing a bigger role .
" this oil industry should be of benefit for everybody - maybe today it 's not of benefit to indigenous people and the government should find the best way to solve that problem , " says roberto ramallo , general manager of pluspetrol norte .
but the problem is that the achuar and other tribes live on top of potentially enormous reserves of crude oil .
thanks to an intense drive to auction it off , almost three-quarters of the peruvian amazon is leased for oil exploration and extraction .
high global demand and the price of oil is also making companies look at the peruvian amazon as an attractive prospect , but is it sustainable ?
" all of this petroleum exploration in the amazon is a grand experiment , " says bill powers of e-tech , a not-for-profit engineering firm .
" it 's just coming into the jungle , developing the resource , getting the economic benefit and historically it 's been whatever happens to whoever was there before , happens .
" there 's no plan , there 's no effort made to ensure that they maintain their cultural integrity or that they have something to do once the rivers and the forest do n't provide what they used to provide . "
future plans carbon trading schemes have yet to reach this part of the amazon and the oil boom is not the only threat .
president alan garcia has proposed privatising large areas of the rainforest , but local officials say the government in lima does not understand the impact this would have .
pluspetrol norte says oil should benefit everyone the regional president of loreto , ivan vasquez , says the amazon needs to preserve its diversity at all costs .
" the ecosystem is the genetic bank of the amazon , as it brings together genetic matrices which do n't exist anywhere else - thousands of interconnected genetic bases .
" that is our capital , the genetic bank that we have to preserve for humanity , and for the world . "
the achuar have so far rejected new oil exploration on their territory .
their story is an emblematic case of resistance for indigenous amazonians and is unprecedented in peru .
but the peruvian rainforest , the biggest stretch of amazon outside brazil , is still the focus of the relentless global hunt to find new sources of fossil fuels .

big business moves into a pristine wilderness and starts destroying the environment and by turn the livelihoods of the indigenous people who live there .
but in a reversal of plot , there are now cases of people living traditional lifestyles who are now invading the territory of the big companies and taking them on at their own game .
the story of the achuar tribe living in the amazon rainforest of north-eastern peru is one of them .
last year , they filed a class action lawsuit against oil giant occidental petroleum , in los angeles .
now they are awaiting a judge 's decision on whether the case can proceed in the us or will be sent back to peru , where it stands little chance of coming to court .
' no credible data the achuar people , who have lived for thousands of years in the rainforest , allege that the company contaminated their territory during more than 30 years of oil drilling , making their people sick , even causing some to die , and damaging their land and livelihoods beyond repair .
occidental petroleum , which pulled out of peru eight years ago , denies liability in the case .
oil spills are still found , the achuar say it has responded , saying : " we are aware of no credible data of negative community health impacts resulting from occidental 's operations in peru . "
the oil bonanza began in peru almost 40 years ago when many foreign companies were given an open invitation by successive governments to test and drill in the amazon .
what they did not consider was the devastating impact it would have on the native people , principally the achuar - their land , their livelihood and their health .
the achuar 's spiritual leader , tomas maynas , wears a bright red headdress made of toucan feathers , and has red war paint streaked on his face .
he is the plaintiff in the suit against the company .
he remembers how everything changed when the oil companies arrived .
he says the animals ran away , the fish died and their crops started to wilt .
a whole generation had their health damaged .
how can we keep quiet as our parents did petronila chumpi " the peruvian state just wants to extract as much oil as they can from our land .
they 've made millions of dollars but we have n't seen it here .
" we know there 's wealth here and there 'll be more drilling so the state will keep on killing us .
but sometimes , when there is pressure , the state gives in . "
the lawsuit alleges occidental petroleum ignored industry standards and employed out-of-date practices , dumping around 9bn barrels of toxic waste water into streams and rivers over 30 years .
after occidental left , its operations were taken over by pluspetrol .
pluspetrol agreed to change practices in late 2006 when the achuar , after repeated attempts to negotiate , took direct action .
shotguns and spears many of the older achuar men once fought in tribal wars with their neighbours , now they finally had the chance to hit their elusive new enemies where it hurt - in their pockets .
peacefully , yet armed with shotguns and spears , they occupied and held the amazon oil wells in october 2006 .
the ecosystem is the genetic bank of the amazon ... that is our capital , the genetic bank that we have to preserve for humanity , and for the world ivan vasquez loreto regional president the government and the company , losing millions of dollars a day , were forced to come to the negotiating table .
the achuar came away with a commitment from pluspetrol to reduce contamination and to pay millions of dollars to clean up and establish a 10-year health plan .
it was thanks to help from outside but also a new generation of indigenous leaders who are learning how to protect their rights in the modern world .
" a whole generation had their health damaged .
how can we keep quiet as our parents did ? " asks 29-year-old petronila chumpi .
" we ca n't allow this , we 're a new generation , we know how to read and write and we have to help our people because they did n't have the knowledge to defend themselves against the oil companies .
but now we do . "
improvement even on a fast motorboat , trompeteros is a long day 's journey up three rain-swollen rivers from loreto 's regional capital , iquitos .
a hamlet of some 3,000 people , it is situated right opposite block eight , one of the main oil wells .
the achuar have lived in the region for thousands of years local people say there is still contamination and oil spills , but now the achuar have gps transceivers to log the problems where they find them .
little by little there are signs of improvement .
but there is frustration on the part of pluspetrol , which has pledged to pay millions of dollars , that the government is not playing a bigger role .
" this oil industry should be of benefit for everybody - maybe today it 's not of benefit to indigenous people and the government should find the best way to solve that problem , " says roberto ramallo , general manager of pluspetrol norte .
but the problem is that the achuar and other tribes live on top of potentially enormous reserves of crude oil .
thanks to an intense drive to auction it off , almost three-quarters of the peruvian amazon is leased for oil exploration and extraction .
high global demand and the price of oil is also making companies look at the peruvian amazon as an attractive prospect , but is it sustainable ?
" all of this petroleum exploration in the amazon is a grand experiment , " says bill powers of e-tech , a not-for-profit engineering firm .
" it 's just coming into the jungle , developing the resource , getting the economic benefit and historically it 's been whatever happens to whoever was there before , happens .

it will argue that early academic teaching could distort a child 's natural way of learning through play .
the nut 's leader said the early years curriculum must not be " too tick box " .

" if the teacher believes a three-year-old does n't have any language at all , that 's what the teacher is going to concentrate on , " he said .
a motion , due to be debated at the annual conference on monday , expresses concern over government plans to ensure children 's centres are lead by early years professionals by 2010 .
it argues that the role of qualified teachers could be undermined by the move .
despite their high cost , nurseries are mostly staffed by low-paid workers with only basic qualifications .
the motion calls for all government-funded children 's centres , which offer nursery provision for three to five year olds - often in deprived areas - to be led by qualified teachers .

in the last few days , prominent members of the catholic clergy have called for mps to have a free vote on the bill .
alan johnson , health secretary " for people out there suffering from parkinson 's disease and motor neurone disease , this is not a question of some issue about the procedure through the house of commons .
this is an issue about whether we can find the drugs that can cure their illnesses .
so this is the heart of the matter . "
the most reverend peter smith , roman catholic archbishop of cardiff " this is a matter which is clearly affecting many mps .
" i have written to the prime minister myself asking him that , in view of these very important issues which touch on the sacredness of human life , its meaning and purpose , would he please grant a free vote , because that is what is really required . "
shaun woodward , northern ireland secretary mr woodward said the bill was an important piece of government business which must be passed , but suggested a compromise was possible .

medical research council ; royal society ; wellcome trust ; academy of medical sciences " this research has massive potential to provide treatments for serious debilitating disorders ranging from developmental abnormalities in young children , to stroke , cancer , hiv / aids , diabetes and parkinson 's disease , as well as better and safer treatment for infertile couples .

denis macshane , former labour minister " mps are also ethically challenged by decisions to go to war , to vote for nuclear weapons , or on issues like id cards or length of detention before charges .
" i respect the catholic and other religions , just as i respect cnd and liberty , but if every difficult issue with ethical implications is a matter for free votes , then democracy , parliament , and the purpose of government becomes meaningless . "
dr kieran breen , parkinson 's disease society " it gives us a tool by which we can try to understand why nerve cells die in parkinson 's .

yet in recent months , these have become fixtures of the country 's public debate .
the opening shot was fired by mark steyn , an outspoken conservative columnist regarded by supporters as the canadian equivalent of denmark 's cartoonists or the netherlands ' ayaan hirsi ali .
in a 2006 article he used demographics to suggest that the west would succumb to muslim domination .
the piece , entitled " the future belongs to islam " and published by the toronto magazine maclean 's , argued that europe was " too enfeebled to resist its remorseless transformation into eurabia " .
mr steyn summarised the presumed global advantage of militant islam with a stark equation : " youth + will = disaster for whoever gets in your way . "
to some , he had crossed the line between vigorous polemic and islamophobia .
the notion that muslims should be feared by virtue of their numbers and purported militancy is " quite inflammatory " , says toronto law student khurrum awan .
short shrift mr awan and fellow students marched on maclean 's a year ago to demand a chance to issue a full-length rebuttal in canada 's only nationwide news magazine .
when people feel insulted they should have recourse khaled mouammar canadian arab federation " what we said is that we want an opportunity to participate in the debate when you are talking about the issues that relate directly to us , " mr awan told the bbc news website .
maclean 's editor gave the students short shrift .
he said he had published 27 letters in response to the steyn article , and would " rather go bankrupt " than let outsiders dictate the content of his magazine .
late last year the students , supported by the canadian islamic congress , took their demand to the federal human rights commission and similar bodies in british columbia and ontario .
the move both publicised the dispute and highlighted a previously little-known aspect of the commissions ' remit - the possibility of acting against speech that is deemed offensive .
defiance the human rights commissions were set up in the 1960s and early 1970s to investigate claims of discrimination in housing and employment .
but section 13 of the 1977 human rights act authorised them to hear complaints about material " likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt " by reason of race , age , gender , disability , marital status , sexual orientation , religion , etc .
mark steyn is a writer with a zest for vigorous polemic -lrb- photo flapsblog -rrb- to some groups , this provides a useful remedy .
" when people feel insulted they should have recourse , " says khaled mouammar , president of the canadian arab federation , who argues that the maclean 's article promoted hate against muslims .
but others are alarmed .
leading the charge against the commissions is ezra levant , an alberta-based publisher who was targeted by a complaint after reprinting the danish caricatures of the prophet muhammad in his -lrb- now-defunct -rrb- newspaper in early 2006 .
his accuser , a calgary muslim leader who cited the koran in his complaint , said the publisher had spread hatred .
in january mr levant appeared before an alberta human rights official charged with deciding whether to refer the matter to a special tribunal .
in a videotaped statement later posted on his website , mr levant called the commission a " sick joke " and defiantly pleaded guilty .
" i 'm not going to try to minimise what i 've done and beg for mercy , " he told the bbc news website .
" i have the right to violate all those koranic precepts because we follow queen elizabeth 's law , not muhammad 's law . "
rights , old and new but by focusing on the legal process , mr levant and others added an important new dimension to the dispute .
it no longer centred on the familiar " islam v west " question .
canada 's human rights act is not an islamic creation ; jewish and other groups have supported complaints under its speech provisions .
the human rights statutes were designed to deal with discriminatory acts , not discriminatory words alan borovoy human rights lawyer and the complainants against both maclean 's and mr levant , in bbc interviews , professed their attachment to free speech and abhorrence of radical islam .
the core of the dispute is best understood not as a clash of civilisations , but as a conflict within the west itself .
it pits old liberal values that sanctify individuals against a new emphasis on the rights of groups .
mr levant regards commission officers as " new-fangled , political crusaders " bent on overturning centuries-old common law .
canada 's human rights tribunals , he points out , are quasi-judicial bodies , not regular courts bound by strict standards of procedure to protect defendants .
every single " section 13 " complaint referred to the federal human rights tribunal has been upheld .
and those targeted often incur heavy costs even if a complaint is dropped - as was the case for mr levant , who says his legal bills amount to c $ 100,000 -lrb- £ 49,000 -rrb- .
' flawed approach ' the commission officials who vet complaints deny acting like rogue inquisitors , and insist they strictly follow the law .
" we have a legal obligation to consider every complaint we receive if it fits one of the grounds for which discrimination cases can be heard , " says carmen gregoire , a spokeswoman for the canadian human rights commission .
but according to critics , the fact that commissions are acting within the law offers little comfort .
alan borovoy , a veteran lawyer who campaigned to set up the commissions , says their willingness to hear complaints about speech rests on flawed legislation .
he regards the provisions on " hatred or contempt " as departures from the original purpose of the human rights act , and wants them scrapped .
" the human rights statutes were designed to deal with discriminatory acts , not discriminatory words , " he says .
mr borovoy believes that minorities ' push for equality , which he supports , has led to a neglect of traditional freedoms .
" other interests have for the time being trumped the free-speech values and i 'm hoping that with some of these cases we might be able to turn the tide , " he says .

yet in recent months , these have become fixtures of the country 's public debate .
the opening shot was fired by mark steyn , an outspoken conservative columnist regarded by supporters as the canadian equivalent of denmark 's cartoonists or the netherlands ' ayaan hirsi ali .
in a 2006 article he used demographics to suggest that the west would succumb to muslim domination .
the piece , entitled " the future belongs to islam " and published by the toronto magazine maclean 's , argued that europe was " too enfeebled to resist its remorseless transformation into eurabia " .
mr steyn summarised the presumed global advantage of militant islam with a stark equation : " youth + will = disaster for whoever gets in your way . "
to some , he had crossed the line between vigorous polemic and islamophobia .
the notion that muslims should be feared by virtue of their numbers and purported militancy is " quite inflammatory " , says toronto law student khurrum awan .
short shrift mr awan and fellow students marched on maclean 's a year ago to demand a chance to issue a full-length rebuttal in canada 's only nationwide news magazine .
when people feel insulted they should have recourse khaled mouammar canadian arab federation " what we said is that we want an opportunity to participate in the debate when you are talking about the issues that relate directly to us , " mr awan told the bbc news website .
maclean 's editor gave the students short shrift .
he said he had published 27 letters in response to the steyn article , and would " rather go bankrupt " than let outsiders dictate the content of his magazine .
late last year the students , supported by the canadian islamic congress , took their demand to the federal human rights commission and similar bodies in british columbia and ontario .
the move both publicised the dispute and highlighted a previously little-known aspect of the commissions ' remit - the possibility of acting against speech that is deemed offensive .
defiance the human rights commissions were set up in the 1960s and early 1970s to investigate claims of discrimination in housing and employment .
but section 13 of the 1977 human rights act authorised them to hear complaints about material " likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt " by reason of race , age , gender , disability , marital status , sexual orientation , religion , etc .

" when people feel insulted they should have recourse , " says khaled mouammar , president of the canadian arab federation , who argues that the maclean 's article promoted hate against muslims .
but others are alarmed .
leading the charge against the commissions is ezra levant , an alberta-based publisher who was targeted by a complaint after reprinting the danish caricatures of the prophet muhammad in his -lrb- now-defunct -rrb- newspaper in early 2006 .
his accuser , a calgary muslim leader who cited the koran in his complaint , said the publisher had spread hatred .
in january mr levant appeared before an alberta human rights official charged with deciding whether to refer the matter to a special tribunal .
in a videotaped statement later posted on his website , mr levant called the commission a " sick joke " and defiantly pleaded guilty .
" i 'm not going to try to minimise what i 've done and beg for mercy , " he told the bbc news website .
" i have the right to violate all those koranic precepts because we follow queen elizabeth 's law , not muhammad 's law . "
rights , old and new but by focusing on the legal process , mr levant and others added an important new dimension to the dispute .
it no longer centred on the familiar " islam v west " question .
canada 's human rights act is not an islamic creation ; jewish and other groups have supported complaints under its speech provisions .
the human rights statutes were designed to deal with discriminatory acts , not discriminatory words alan borovoy human rights lawyer and the complainants against both maclean 's and mr levant , in bbc interviews , professed their attachment to free speech and abhorrence of radical islam .
the core of the dispute is best understood not as a clash of civilisations , but as a conflict within the west itself .
it pits old liberal values that sanctify individuals against a new emphasis on the rights of groups .
mr levant regards commission officers as " new-fangled , political crusaders " bent on overturning centuries-old common law .
canada 's human rights tribunals , he points out , are quasi-judicial bodies , not regular courts bound by strict standards of procedure to protect defendants .
every single " section 13 " complaint referred to the federal human rights tribunal has been upheld .
and those targeted often incur heavy costs even if a complaint is dropped - as was the case for mr levant , who says his legal bills amount to c $ 100,000 -lrb- £ 49,000 -rrb- .

josh fowler , who stands 6ft 10in -lrb- 2.08m -rrb- , has been coaching basketball at schools in rhondda , south wales .
it is part of the 5x60 project run by the sports council for wales and funded by the welsh assembly government .
the projects aims to encourage secondary school pupils to do 60 minutes of exercise , five times a week .
josh , 24 , who played college basketball in south carolina , came to wales to play for the glamorgan gladiators in the english basketball league and has been coaching children in his spare time .
" the kids seem to love it and every session i 've done they seem to be having a blast , " he said .
takeaways " even though basketball has been in wales for a long time , it 's rarely in the normal curriculum in schools .
" it 's mostly rugby around here is n't it ! "
the children say they have enjoyed learning skills from josh and , with figures suggesting that around one in five 13-year-olds are obese or overweight , they are aware of the importance of exercise .
james messenger , 13 , a pupil at ferndale community school , said : " it 's good to do exercise .
" at our age it 's quite easy to get obese with takeaways and , when you go out , it 's easy to pick up fast food instead of healthy stuff like fruit . "
ryan howells , 12 , said : " josh is really tall and really good !
" he 's taught us new stuff and sometimes comes to the tournaments with us and encourages us . "
one of the main aims of the 5x60 project is to encourage children who do not enjoy traditional sports such as rugby , to find an activity that suits them .
julie rotchell , of the sports council for wales , said : " we 're looking to encourage those children that are n't currently participating in sporting activity to become involved .
" we 're encouraging them to become much more active in their lifestyles and become active adults . "
although the aim is to get children to take part in activities out of school as well , 5x60 organisers are hoping to get all secondary schools in wales to take part by 2009 .
josh was due to fly back to south carolina on the evening of this interview but he said he had enjoyed a fantastic experience in south wales .
" the rhondda is great and the people are very friendly , " he said .
" it 's been a great experience , probably the most valuable experience of my life . "

josh fowler , who stands 6ft 10in -lrb- 2.08m -rrb- , has been coaching basketball at schools in rhondda , south wales .
it is part of the 5x60 project run by the sports council for wales and funded by the welsh assembly government .
the projects aims to encourage secondary school pupils to do 60 minutes of exercise , five times a week .
josh , 24 , who played college basketball in south carolina , came to wales to play for the glamorgan gladiators in the english basketball league and has been coaching children in his spare time .
" the kids seem to love it and every session i 've done they seem to be having a blast , " he said .
takeaways " even though basketball has been in wales for a long time , it 's rarely in the normal curriculum in schools .
" it 's mostly rugby around here is n't it ! "
the children say they have enjoyed learning skills from josh and , with figures suggesting that around one in five 13-year-olds are obese or overweight , they are aware of the importance of exercise .
james messenger , 13 , a pupil at ferndale community school , said : " it 's good to do exercise .
" at our age it 's quite easy to get obese with takeaways and , when you go out , it 's easy to pick up fast food instead of healthy stuff like fruit . "
pupils at ferndale have picked up new basketball skills ryan howells , 12 , said : " josh is really tall and really good !
" he 's taught us new stuff and sometimes comes to the tournaments with us and encourages us . "
one of the main aims of the 5x60 project is to encourage children who do not enjoy traditional sports such as rugby , to find an activity that suits them .
julie rotchell , of the sports council for wales , said : " we 're looking to encourage those children that are n't currently participating in sporting activity to become involved .
" we 're encouraging them to become much more active in their lifestyles and become active adults . "
although the aim is to get children to take part in activities out of school as well , 5x60 organisers are hoping to get all secondary schools in wales to take part by 2009 .
josh was due to fly back to south carolina on the evening of this interview but he said he had enjoyed a fantastic experience in south wales .
" the rhondda is great and the people are very friendly , " he said .
" it 's been a great experience , probably the most valuable experience of my life . "

tougher controls on vending machines in pubs and restaurants are also being discussed , and the public will be consulted on the proposals soon .
ex-smoker and tory leader david cameron said the idea was worth looking at .
but the association of convenience stores said the move would be ineffective and present major problems .
it said forcing shops to hide their cigarettes would create practical difficulties and result in extra expense for shop owners .
under the counter outlining the proposals , public health minister dawn primarolo said it was " vital " to teach children that " smoking is bad " .
" if that means stripping out vending machines or removing cigarettes from behind the counter , i 'm willing to do that , " she said .
ms primarolo stressed : " children who smoke are putting their lives at risk and are more likely to die of cancer than people who start smoking later . "
opposition leader mr cameron backed the idea , saying : " as someone who struggled with giving up smoking , it helps if you take away some of the temptation .
" it is difficult and there will be all sorts of problems in terms of the layout of shops , that 's why it is right to have a consultation .
have your say " either ban cigarettes entirely -lrb- and deal with the loss to the treasury -rrb- or do n't , but enough with demonising smokers . "
ebon _ bear , stoke-on-trent send us your comments " let 's not rule it out , " he added .
the measures could effectively force the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products under the counter in convenience shops and supermarkets .
measures that make it easier to sell nicotine replacement gums and patches are also under consideration .
the department of health , which is keen to prevent youngsters from smoking , has cited research that suggests someone who starts smoking at the age of 15 is three times more likely to die of smoking-related cancer than someone who starts in their late 20s .
the proposed measures come after this year 's budget in which chancellor alistair darling increased the duty on tobacco , adding 11p to the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes and 4p to the price of five cigars .
the chancellor also said the government was continuing the 5 % reduced rate of vat on smoking cessation products beyond 30 june .
a ban on smoking in public places and workplaces in england came into force last july .
bans were introduced in scotland in 2006 , and in wales and northern ireland in 2007 .
