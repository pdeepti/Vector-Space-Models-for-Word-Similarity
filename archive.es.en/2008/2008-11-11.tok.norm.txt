11 - the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month , and went down in history as the moment , every year , when the world remembers the dead .
but not many combat veterans will be in attendance at tuesday 's ceremonies .
today , there are few surviving members of the british forces that joined france , russia and italy in the battle against germany and the other central powers .
erich kastner , the last of the german troops , died on jan .
1 this year , aged 107 .
the last french veteran , italian-born legionnaire lazare ponticelli , survived him by only two months , dying on march 12 , aged 110 .
one of the five remaining british veterans died last week at the age of 108 in australia , where he moved in 1928 , the bbc reported .
sydney maurice lucas , who was born in leicester , england , on sept .
21 , 1900 , regularly led the annual anzac day parade in melbourne , said the report .
he was among the last batch of conscripts to be called up in aug . , 1918 .
in world war ii , he volunteered for the australian army in june 1940 and was posted to a machine-gun unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciliation : france 's mitterand and germany 's kohl at verdun in 1984 australia is also home to another of the known world war i survivors , 107-year-old claude choules .
meanwhile , three of the veterans still alive in britain are expected to attend this year 's official celebrations .
henry allingham , 112 , harry patch , 110 and bill stone , 108 , are scheduled to lead a two-minute period of silence at a ceremony in london .
the fight against forgetting but even though few eye witnesses are still alive , " to forget would be the worst thing , " as france 's minister for veterans ' affairs jean-marie bockel said last week .
" now that the last -lrb- french -rrb- veteran has gone , 90 years on we once more share a moment of awareness .
this war is part of our collective memory , and he who does not know his past has no future , " he said , inaugurating a memorial .
france 's president nicolas sarkozy , britain 's prince charles , the speaker of the german parliament peter mueller and australia 's governor general quentin bryce will hold a solemn ceremony of remembrance on tuesday .
they will meet at fort douaumont , epicenter of the 1916 battle of verdun , for speeches and prayers at the ossuary where the remains lie of 300,000 men cut down by machine-gun and artillery fire in 300 days and nights of hell .
afterwards , sarkozy will visit the nearby german cemetery .
but in a break with tradition , will not commemorate the event at the tomb of the unknown soldier under the arc de triomphe in the heart of paris .
too many memorial days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb of the unknown soldier is the arc de triomphe , paris while sarkozy is busy paying tribute to the war 's victims , a government-commissioned report said the country should cut back on the number of official memorial days .
world war i , fought in large part on their home soil , cost more than 1.4 million french lives between 1914 and 1918 .
with 11 other national days ranging from memorials to the dead of france 's colonial wars in algeria and indochina to the abolition of slavery , complaints have been made that official commemoration has gone overboard .
" it is not healthy that within half a century , the number of commemorations has doubled , " said the report of the commission headed by historian andre kaspi .
the commission recommends retaining armistice day , the may 8 celebration to mark the defeat of nazi germany , and the bastille day celebration on july 14 , relegating the other commemorations to local or regional events , reported reuters . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .
the gfz said the death toll would have been considerably lower if an early warning system had been in place at the time .
avoiding the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buoys can detect the waves when they 're still far out at sea the system about to be launched makes use of sensors placed on the seabed which relay details of changes in water pressure to buoys on the surface .

the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .
" the central question is knowing how to interpret the data so that we can say with complete certainty that a tsunami is coming or not - and predicting what effect it will have , " said stefan dech , director of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen and head of the " early warning and situation center , risk modeling and earth observation " project team .
" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "

" the indonesian meteorological and geophysical services were able to issue a warning 15 to 20 minutes before the wave hit , " said lauterjung .
all the buoys should be installed by early 2009 , and the german team will remain in indonesia another year to help train local staff .
" i believe we need to work on the system with our indonesian counterparts for another few years and to continue training , " said lauterjung .

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .
the gfz said the death toll would have been considerably lower if an early warning system had been in place at the time .
avoiding the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buoys can detect the waves when they 're still far out at sea the system about to be launched makes use of sensors placed on the seabed which relay details of changes in water pressure to buoys on the surface .

the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .
" the central question is knowing how to interpret the data so that we can say with complete certainty that a tsunami is coming or not - and predicting what effect it will have , " said stefan dech , director of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen and head of the " early warning and situation center , risk modeling and earth observation " project team .
" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "
" if our predictions are correct 50 percent of the time then we could say the system was successful , " he went on .

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .
the gfz said the death toll would have been considerably lower if an early warning system had been in place at the time .
avoiding the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buoys can detect the waves when they 're still far out at sea the system about to be launched makes use of sensors placed on the seabed which relay details of changes in water pressure to buoys on the surface .
the information is then transmitted via satellite to a tsunami early-warning center in indonesia .
the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .
" the central question is knowing how to interpret the data so that we can say with complete certainty that a tsunami is coming or not - and predicting what effect it will have , " said stefan dech , director of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen and head of the " early warning and situation center , risk modeling and earth observation " project team .
" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "
" if our predictions are correct 50 percent of the time then we could say the system was successful , " he went on .
" other tsunami early-warning systems such as those that exist in the pacific regularly issue false alarms . "
educating the public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next step is to ensure that the public knows what to do when a tsunami is detected the gitews projects can already point to one success - the bengkulu earthquake off sumatra on sept .
12 , 2007 , when it was possible to obtain a first " heads-up " alert after less than two minutes and a first estimate of location , depth range and magnitude after two-and-a-half minutes .
" the indonesian meteorological and geophysical services were able to issue a warning 15 to 20 minutes before the wave hit , " said lauterjung .
all the buoys should be installed by early 2009 , and the german team will remain in indonesia another year to help train local staff .
" i believe we need to work on the system with our indonesian counterparts for another few years and to continue training , " said lauterjung .
" this is a very long-term project .
our indonesian partners also have to educate the population in terms of how they should react to a warning , and this is a huge task . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 - the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month , and went down in history as the moment , every year , when the world remembers the dead .
but not many combat veterans will be in attendance at tuesday 's ceremonies .
today , there are few surviving members of the british forces that joined france , russia and italy in the battle against germany and the other central powers .
erich kastner , the last of the german troops , died on jan .
1 this year , aged 107 .
the last french veteran , italian-born legionnaire lazare ponticelli , survived him by only two months , dying on march 12 , aged 110 .
one of the five remaining british veterans died last week at the age of 108 in australia , where he moved in 1928 , the bbc reported .
sydney maurice lucas , who was born in leicester , england , on sept .
21 , 1900 , regularly led the annual anzac day parade in melbourne , said the report .
he was among the last batch of conscripts to be called up in aug . , 1918 .
in world war ii , he volunteered for the australian army in june 1940 and was posted to a machine-gun unit .

henry allingham , 112 , harry patch , 110 and bill stone , 108 , are scheduled to lead a two-minute period of silence at a ceremony in london .
the fight against forgetting but even though few eye witnesses are still alive , " to forget would be the worst thing , " as france 's minister for veterans ' affairs jean-marie bockel said last week .
" now that the last -lrb- french -rrb- veteran has gone , 90 years on we once more share a moment of awareness .
this war is part of our collective memory , and he who does not know his past has no future , " he said , inaugurating a memorial .
france 's president nicolas sarkozy , britain 's prince charles , the speaker of the german parliament peter mueller and australia 's governor general quentin bryce will hold a solemn ceremony of remembrance on tuesday .
they will meet at fort douaumont , epicenter of the 1916 battle of verdun , for speeches and prayers at the ossuary where the remains lie of 300,000 men cut down by machine-gun and artillery fire in 300 days and nights of hell .
afterwards , sarkozy will visit the nearby german cemetery .
but in a break with tradition , will not commemorate the event at the tomb of the unknown soldier under the arc de triomphe in the heart of paris .
too many memorial days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb of the unknown soldier is the arc de triomphe , paris while sarkozy is busy paying tribute to the war 's victims , a government-commissioned report said the country should cut back on the number of official memorial days .
world war i , fought in large part on their home soil , cost more than 1.4 million french lives between 1914 and 1918 .
with 11 other national days ranging from memorials to the dead of france 's colonial wars in algeria and indochina to the abolition of slavery , complaints have been made that official commemoration has gone overboard .
" it is not healthy that within half a century , the number of commemorations has doubled , " said the report of the commission headed by historian andre kaspi .
the commission recommends retaining armistice day , the may 8 celebration to mark the defeat of nazi germany , and the bastille day celebration on july 14 , relegating the other commemorations to local or regional events , reported reuters . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .
" you ca n't build a business model just on banking secrecy . "

drawn up by the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the zew index rose to minus 53.5 , rebounding from minus 63 in october amid signs that an element of calm has returned to global share markets after weeks of chaotic selling .
analysts had forecast that the indicator would remain at about minus 63 in october .
the survey represents a key test of sentiment in europe 's biggest economy amid fallout from the world financial crisis .
shoring up confidence the 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan and the 500-billion-euro bank rescue package unveiled by chancellor angela merkel 's government in recent weeks also helped to steady investor nerves .
in addition , the release of the zew survey came in the wake of a wave of global rate cuts and a weaker euro against the us dollar .
" the earlier pessimistic expectations of the financial market experts are confirmed by the current economic development in germany , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the survey 's release .
" the experts , however , seem hopeful that the collective actions of governments and central banks will mitigate the economic slowdown , " he added .
well below historical average the release of the zew survey comes after the index plunged in october amid deepening economic fears following the global share market sell off .
however , the zew indicator still remains well below its historical average of 27.1 points .
the release of the index comes ahead of the publication on thursday of official data showing germany slumping into a recession during the third quarter .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , with analysts expecting that upcoming figures from germany 's statistics office to show a further 0.1 percent contraction in the quarter which ended september 30 .
as a result , germany will fulfill the technical definition of recession after clocking up two consecutive quarters of negative growth . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .

the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”

merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 11.11.2008 nuclear transport protests particularly violent , say police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convoy of 11 nuclear waste containers arrived in gorleben a train carrying nuclear waste has finally reached its destination in gorleben , germany , where the radioactive material is to be stored .
but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 11.11.2008 germany , indonesia launch tsunami early-warning system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses buoys to detect changes in sea conditions - and possible tsunamis nearly four years after the devastating asian tsunami of december 2004 which claimed 230,000 lives , an early-warning system developed and funded with german assistance is set to begin operation . indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono will attend tuesday 's ceremony in jakarta along with representatives of the german government , the german research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- said .
the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .
the gfz said the death toll would have been considerably lower if an early warning system had been in place at the time .
avoiding the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buoys can detect the waves when they 're still far out at sea the system about to be launched makes use of sensors placed on the seabed which relay details of changes in water pressure to buoys on the surface .
the information is then transmitted via satellite to a tsunami early-warning center in indonesia .
the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .

10 , that efforts to defend europe 's car industry would resemble in some way the expected us approach to its own auto sector crisis .
european governments " ca n't avoid seeing what the americans are doing " and could not afford to let europe 's automobile sector " disappear , " juncker told radio france inter .
calls for subsidized low-cost loans the efforts come as german carmakers look to chancellor angela merkel 's government for signs it will provide further relief for its embattled auto industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has warned it is slowly running out of operating cash german carmaker opel has asked for tax incentives for new car purchases , the introduction of low-cost consumer loans and a bonus for taking cars more than 10 years old off the road .
the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .
the requests were made only a week after the german government said it would implement a series of support measures including cancelling the road tax for new car owners for one or two years .
" the measures presented are a first step but are not enough to underpin demand for new cars by families with weak or modest incomes , " said a letter sent friday by opel chief hans demant , works committee head klaus franz and general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- europe boss carl-peter forster .
opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .
ford , the second largest auto firm in the us , also reported substantial losses and said it would cut 10 percent of its north american labor costs , which equates to substantial layoffs .
the carmaker said it had lost $ 129 million in the third quarter of 2008 .
us leaders appeal for auto aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahm emanuel , left , and obama have made clear their desire to help out us carmakers us congressional leaders saturday joined president-elect barack obama in calling for support for the ailing us auto industry , sending a letter to treasury secretary henry paulson to tap money from the government 's $ 700-billion financial rescue package .
" a healthy automobile manufacturing sector is essential to the restoration of financial market stability , the overall health of our economy and the livelihood of the automobile sector 's workforce , " said speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid .
on friday , obama called the auto industry the " backbone of american manufacturing , " signalling his intention to help detroit under his presidency , which begins jan .
20 .
" washington needs to look at fast-forwarding the $ 25 billion that has been provided for retooling the factories for basically a more fuel-efficient auto fleet , " said obama 's chief of staff , congressman rahm emanuel , referring to an aid package recently authorized by congress for the car industry .
but automakers have asked for more help , insisting they need another $ 25 billion - on top of the aid package for improving fuel efficiency - to stave off what they say could be their imminent collapse . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has warned it is slowly running out of operating cash german carmaker opel has asked for tax incentives for new car purchases , the introduction of low-cost consumer loans and a bonus for taking cars more than 10 years old off the road .
the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .
the requests were made only a week after the german government said it would implement a series of support measures including cancelling the road tax for new car owners for one or two years .

opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 11.11.2008 germany 's " fifth season " begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people come together to celebrate carnival in big german cities in many parts of germany , 11:11 am on nov .
11 marks the start of carnival , a season of controlled debauchery and uncontrolled drinking that climaxes during the days preceding ash wednesday . at 11:11 on nov .
11 , an always colorful crowd in cologne 's alter markt square really gets raucous .
it 's at this moment that plans for the " fifth season " - carnival - officially get rolling and party starts , at least for a while .
germans of all ages begin anticipating a good dose of debauchery and revelry ahead of the sobriety of lent .
particularly in the rhineland , carnival has been ushered in with much fanfare since the 19th century - something that has to do with the magical " fool 's number . "
since the middle ages , the number 11 has been considered the number of sin , and associated with court jesters and fools .
from nov .
11 , many clubs in the region begin organizing dances , comedy shows and other performances in the lead up to a short suspension of festivities over advent and christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival celebrations can take on a political tone in the city of cologne , for example , carnival peaks when around one million people use the fifth season as an excuse to get raucously drunk in bars , on the streets , on buses and on trains .
in fact , one would be challenged to find any public space during this period where people were n't standing around gulping down beer and endulging in general merryment .
and that 's the modern concept of carnival : unwind and be foolish .
in fact a common carnival battle cry is , " anyone who is not a fool at carnival is foolish for the rest of the year . "
here one day , gone the next but perhaps the greatest oddity of carnival is the scary ease with which society returns to normal , daily life immediately after the celebrations conclude .
business people , some of whom only one day prior had been drinking in the streets dressed as clowns and giant bumble bees , pack trams on the way to work and look down to find empty beer bottles rolling back and forth on the floor , all the while seeming as though they would have no idea what had transpired over the previous days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne becomes clown-city during carnival this , of course , all comes at the business end of carnival , on and around the thursday before ash wednesday , the first day of lent .
the jocularity reaches its peak with the rose monday parades on feb .
23 .
saint martin 's day but the celebration 's official launch date , nov .
11 , actually represents a more austere event - saint martin 's day , which during the middle ages heralded a 40-day fast both preceded and followed by hearty celebrations with much drinking and eating .

10 , that efforts to defend europe 's car industry would resemble in some way the expected us approach to its own auto sector crisis .
european governments " ca n't avoid seeing what the americans are doing " and could not afford to let europe 's automobile sector " disappear , " juncker told radio france inter .
calls for subsidized low-cost loans the efforts come as german carmakers look to chancellor angela merkel 's government for signs it will provide further relief for its embattled auto industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has warned it is slowly running out of operating cash german carmaker opel has asked for tax incentives for new car purchases , the introduction of low-cost consumer loans and a bonus for taking cars more than 10 years old off the road .
the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .
the requests were made only a week after the german government said it would implement a series of support measures including cancelling the road tax for new car owners for one or two years .
" the measures presented are a first step but are not enough to underpin demand for new cars by families with weak or modest incomes , " said a letter sent friday by opel chief hans demant , works committee head klaus franz and general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- europe boss carl-peter forster .
opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .
ford , the second largest auto firm in the us , also reported substantial losses and said it would cut 10 percent of its north american labor costs , which equates to substantial layoffs .
the carmaker said it had lost $ 129 million in the third quarter of 2008 .
us leaders appeal for auto aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahm emanuel , left , and obama have made clear their desire to help out us carmakers us congressional leaders saturday joined president-elect barack obama in calling for support for the ailing us auto industry , sending a letter to treasury secretary henry paulson to tap money from the government 's $ 700-billion financial rescue package .
" a healthy automobile manufacturing sector is essential to the restoration of financial market stability , the overall health of our economy and the livelihood of the automobile sector 's workforce , " said speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid .
on friday , obama called the auto industry the " backbone of american manufacturing , " signalling his intention to help detroit under his presidency , which begins jan .
20 .
" washington needs to look at fast-forwarding the $ 25 billion that has been provided for retooling the factories for basically a more fuel-efficient auto fleet , " said obama 's chief of staff , congressman rahm emanuel , referring to an aid package recently authorized by congress for the car industry .
but automakers have asked for more help , insisting they need another $ 25 billion - on top of the aid package for improving fuel efficiency - to stave off what they say could be their imminent collapse . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .
let us use it and use it well , " said de hoop scheffer . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .

the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .

the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .
" the central question is knowing how to interpret the data so that we can say with complete certainty that a tsunami is coming or not - and predicting what effect it will have , " said stefan dech , director of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen and head of the " early warning and situation center , risk modeling and earth observation " project team .
" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "
" if our predictions are correct 50 percent of the time then we could say the system was successful , " he went on .
" other tsunami early-warning systems such as those that exist in the pacific regularly issue false alarms . "

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .

merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 11.11.2008 nuclear transport protests particularly violent , say police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convoy of 11 nuclear waste containers arrived in gorleben a train carrying nuclear waste has finally reached its destination in gorleben , germany , where the radioactive material is to be stored .
but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .
10 .
she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .
let us use it and use it well , " said de hoop scheffer . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .
the gfz said the death toll would have been considerably lower if an early warning system had been in place at the time .
avoiding the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buoys can detect the waves when they 're still far out at sea the system about to be launched makes use of sensors placed on the seabed which relay details of changes in water pressure to buoys on the surface .
the information is then transmitted via satellite to a tsunami early-warning center in indonesia .
the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .
" the central question is knowing how to interpret the data so that we can say with complete certainty that a tsunami is coming or not - and predicting what effect it will have , " said stefan dech , director of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen and head of the " early warning and situation center , risk modeling and earth observation " project team .
" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "
" if our predictions are correct 50 percent of the time then we could say the system was successful , " he went on .
" other tsunami early-warning systems such as those that exist in the pacific regularly issue false alarms . "
educating the public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next step is to ensure that the public knows what to do when a tsunami is detected the gitews projects can already point to one success - the bengkulu earthquake off sumatra on sept .
12 , 2007 , when it was possible to obtain a first " heads-up " alert after less than two minutes and a first estimate of location , depth range and magnitude after two-and-a-half minutes .
" the indonesian meteorological and geophysical services were able to issue a warning 15 to 20 minutes before the wave hit , " said lauterjung .
all the buoys should be installed by early 2009 , and the german team will remain in indonesia another year to help train local staff .
" i believe we need to work on the system with our indonesian counterparts for another few years and to continue training , " said lauterjung .
" this is a very long-term project .
our indonesian partners also have to educate the population in terms of how they should react to a warning , and this is a huge task . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 marks the start of carnival , a season of controlled debauchery and uncontrolled drinking that climaxes during the days preceding ash wednesday . at 11:11 on nov .
11 , an always colorful crowd in cologne 's alter markt square really gets raucous .
it 's at this moment that plans for the " fifth season " - carnival - officially get rolling and party starts , at least for a while .
germans of all ages begin anticipating a good dose of debauchery and revelry ahead of the sobriety of lent .
particularly in the rhineland , carnival has been ushered in with much fanfare since the 19th century - something that has to do with the magical " fool 's number . "
since the middle ages , the number 11 has been considered the number of sin , and associated with court jesters and fools .
from nov .
11 , many clubs in the region begin organizing dances , comedy shows and other performances in the lead up to a short suspension of festivities over advent and christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival celebrations can take on a political tone in the city of cologne , for example , carnival peaks when around one million people use the fifth season as an excuse to get raucously drunk in bars , on the streets , on buses and on trains .
in fact , one would be challenged to find any public space during this period where people were n't standing around gulping down beer and endulging in general merryment .
and that 's the modern concept of carnival : unwind and be foolish .
in fact a common carnival battle cry is , " anyone who is not a fool at carnival is foolish for the rest of the year . "
here one day , gone the next but perhaps the greatest oddity of carnival is the scary ease with which society returns to normal , daily life immediately after the celebrations conclude .
business people , some of whom only one day prior had been drinking in the streets dressed as clowns and giant bumble bees , pack trams on the way to work and look down to find empty beer bottles rolling back and forth on the floor , all the while seeming as though they would have no idea what had transpired over the previous days .

world war i , fought in large part on their home soil , cost more than 1.4 million french lives between 1914 and 1918 .
with 11 other national days ranging from memorials to the dead of france 's colonial wars in algeria and indochina to the abolition of slavery , complaints have been made that official commemoration has gone overboard .
" it is not healthy that within half a century , the number of commemorations has doubled , " said the report of the commission headed by historian andre kaspi .
the commission recommends retaining armistice day , the may 8 celebration to mark the defeat of nazi germany , and the bastille day celebration on july 14 , relegating the other commemorations to local or regional events , reported reuters . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .
the gfz said the death toll would have been considerably lower if an early warning system had been in place at the time .
avoiding the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buoys can detect the waves when they 're still far out at sea the system about to be launched makes use of sensors placed on the seabed which relay details of changes in water pressure to buoys on the surface .
the information is then transmitted via satellite to a tsunami early-warning center in indonesia .
the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .
" the central question is knowing how to interpret the data so that we can say with complete certainty that a tsunami is coming or not - and predicting what effect it will have , " said stefan dech , director of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen and head of the " early warning and situation center , risk modeling and earth observation " project team .
" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "
" if our predictions are correct 50 percent of the time then we could say the system was successful , " he went on .
" other tsunami early-warning systems such as those that exist in the pacific regularly issue false alarms . "
educating the public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next step is to ensure that the public knows what to do when a tsunami is detected the gitews projects can already point to one success - the bengkulu earthquake off sumatra on sept .
12 , 2007 , when it was possible to obtain a first " heads-up " alert after less than two minutes and a first estimate of location , depth range and magnitude after two-and-a-half minutes .
" the indonesian meteorological and geophysical services were able to issue a warning 15 to 20 minutes before the wave hit , " said lauterjung .
all the buoys should be installed by early 2009 , and the german team will remain in indonesia another year to help train local staff .
" i believe we need to work on the system with our indonesian counterparts for another few years and to continue training , " said lauterjung .
" this is a very long-term project .
our indonesian partners also have to educate the population in terms of how they should react to a warning , and this is a huge task . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.11.2008 experts : obama will demand end to swiss banking secrecy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama could start calling for the swiss to change their banking ways the majority of swiss were in favor of barack obama 's candidacy .
but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .
" you ca n't build a business model just on banking secrecy . "
so when obama takes office in january , the first cracks may begin to appear in the proverbial wall of silence around switzerland 's banking industry . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .

human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .

" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .

merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 11.11.2008 nuclear transport protests particularly violent , say police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convoy of 11 nuclear waste containers arrived in gorleben a train carrying nuclear waste has finally reached its destination in gorleben , germany , where the radioactive material is to be stored .
but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .

10 , that efforts to defend europe 's car industry would resemble in some way the expected us approach to its own auto sector crisis .
european governments " ca n't avoid seeing what the americans are doing " and could not afford to let europe 's automobile sector " disappear , " juncker told radio france inter .
calls for subsidized low-cost loans the efforts come as german carmakers look to chancellor angela merkel 's government for signs it will provide further relief for its embattled auto industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has warned it is slowly running out of operating cash german carmaker opel has asked for tax incentives for new car purchases , the introduction of low-cost consumer loans and a bonus for taking cars more than 10 years old off the road .
the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .
the requests were made only a week after the german government said it would implement a series of support measures including cancelling the road tax for new car owners for one or two years .
" the measures presented are a first step but are not enough to underpin demand for new cars by families with weak or modest incomes , " said a letter sent friday by opel chief hans demant , works committee head klaus franz and general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- europe boss carl-peter forster .
opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .

10 , that efforts to defend europe 's car industry would resemble in some way the expected us approach to its own auto sector crisis .
european governments " ca n't avoid seeing what the americans are doing " and could not afford to let europe 's automobile sector " disappear , " juncker told radio france inter .
calls for subsidized low-cost loans the efforts come as german carmakers look to chancellor angela merkel 's government for signs it will provide further relief for its embattled auto industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has warned it is slowly running out of operating cash german carmaker opel has asked for tax incentives for new car purchases , the introduction of low-cost consumer loans and a bonus for taking cars more than 10 years old off the road .
the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .
the requests were made only a week after the german government said it would implement a series of support measures including cancelling the road tax for new car owners for one or two years .
" the measures presented are a first step but are not enough to underpin demand for new cars by families with weak or modest incomes , " said a letter sent friday by opel chief hans demant , works committee head klaus franz and general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- europe boss carl-peter forster .
opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .
ford , the second largest auto firm in the us , also reported substantial losses and said it would cut 10 percent of its north american labor costs , which equates to substantial layoffs .
the carmaker said it had lost $ 129 million in the third quarter of 2008 .
us leaders appeal for auto aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahm emanuel , left , and obama have made clear their desire to help out us carmakers us congressional leaders saturday joined president-elect barack obama in calling for support for the ailing us auto industry , sending a letter to treasury secretary henry paulson to tap money from the government 's $ 700-billion financial rescue package .
" a healthy automobile manufacturing sector is essential to the restoration of financial market stability , the overall health of our economy and the livelihood of the automobile sector 's workforce , " said speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid .
on friday , obama called the auto industry the " backbone of american manufacturing , " signalling his intention to help detroit under his presidency , which begins jan .
20 .
" washington needs to look at fast-forwarding the $ 25 billion that has been provided for retooling the factories for basically a more fuel-efficient auto fleet , " said obama 's chief of staff , congressman rahm emanuel , referring to an aid package recently authorized by congress for the car industry .
but automakers have asked for more help , insisting they need another $ 25 billion - on top of the aid package for improving fuel efficiency - to stave off what they say could be their imminent collapse . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .
10 .
she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .
let us use it and use it well , " said de hoop scheffer . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .
10 .
she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .

10 , that efforts to defend europe 's car industry would resemble in some way the expected us approach to its own auto sector crisis .
european governments " ca n't avoid seeing what the americans are doing " and could not afford to let europe 's automobile sector " disappear , " juncker told radio france inter .
calls for subsidized low-cost loans the efforts come as german carmakers look to chancellor angela merkel 's government for signs it will provide further relief for its embattled auto industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has warned it is slowly running out of operating cash german carmaker opel has asked for tax incentives for new car purchases , the introduction of low-cost consumer loans and a bonus for taking cars more than 10 years old off the road .
the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .
the requests were made only a week after the german government said it would implement a series of support measures including cancelling the road tax for new car owners for one or two years .
" the measures presented are a first step but are not enough to underpin demand for new cars by families with weak or modest incomes , " said a letter sent friday by opel chief hans demant , works committee head klaus franz and general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- europe boss carl-peter forster .
opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .
ford , the second largest auto firm in the us , also reported substantial losses and said it would cut 10 percent of its north american labor costs , which equates to substantial layoffs .
the carmaker said it had lost $ 129 million in the third quarter of 2008 .
us leaders appeal for auto aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahm emanuel , left , and obama have made clear their desire to help out us carmakers us congressional leaders saturday joined president-elect barack obama in calling for support for the ailing us auto industry , sending a letter to treasury secretary henry paulson to tap money from the government 's $ 700-billion financial rescue package .
" a healthy automobile manufacturing sector is essential to the restoration of financial market stability , the overall health of our economy and the livelihood of the automobile sector 's workforce , " said speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid .
on friday , obama called the auto industry the " backbone of american manufacturing , " signalling his intention to help detroit under his presidency , which begins jan .
20 .
" washington needs to look at fast-forwarding the $ 25 billion that has been provided for retooling the factories for basically a more fuel-efficient auto fleet , " said obama 's chief of staff , congressman rahm emanuel , referring to an aid package recently authorized by congress for the car industry .
but automakers have asked for more help , insisting they need another $ 25 billion - on top of the aid package for improving fuel efficiency - to stave off what they say could be their imminent collapse . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .
the requests were made only a week after the german government said it would implement a series of support measures including cancelling the road tax for new car owners for one or two years .

opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .

" washington needs to look at fast-forwarding the $ 25 billion that has been provided for retooling the factories for basically a more fuel-efficient auto fleet , " said obama 's chief of staff , congressman rahm emanuel , referring to an aid package recently authorized by congress for the car industry .

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

shoring up confidence the 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan and the 500-billion-euro bank rescue package unveiled by chancellor angela merkel 's government in recent weeks also helped to steady investor nerves .
in addition , the release of the zew survey came in the wake of a wave of global rate cuts and a weaker euro against the us dollar .
" the earlier pessimistic expectations of the financial market experts are confirmed by the current economic development in germany , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the survey 's release .
" the experts , however , seem hopeful that the collective actions of governments and central banks will mitigate the economic slowdown , " he added .
well below historical average the release of the zew survey comes after the index plunged in october amid deepening economic fears following the global share market sell off .
however , the zew indicator still remains well below its historical average of 27.1 points .
the release of the index comes ahead of the publication on thursday of official data showing germany slumping into a recession during the third quarter .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , with analysts expecting that upcoming figures from germany 's statistics office to show a further 0.1 percent contraction in the quarter which ended september 30 .
as a result , germany will fulfill the technical definition of recession after clocking up two consecutive quarters of negative growth . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .
10 .
she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .
let us use it and use it well , " said de hoop scheffer . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .
10 .
she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .
let us use it and use it well , " said de hoop scheffer . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .

" africa conquers the white house " is the heading of a statement issued from the office of the npd deputy juergen gansel from the eastern german state of saxony .
the npd has never cleared the five-percent minimum for representation in the german bundestag on a national parliamentary level , but the party holds seats in two regional states in eastern germany , where its anti-semitic and anti-immigrant platform has attracted a following among disaffected youth and the unemployed .
gansel characterized obama 's election triumph as " the american alliance of jews and negroes " and even condemned the german public for their outpouring of enthusiasm for the us president-elect , who was born to a white american mother and a kenyan father .
" many people in the ' diverse ' republic germany have been swept up in obama fever which resembles an african tropical disease , " he said .
deirdre berger , who is the director of the american jewish committee 's -lrb- ajc -rrb- office in berlin told afp news agency that she was shocked by gansel 's " open expression of racism , anti-semitism and anti-americanism . "
she said the ajc hoped german authorities would look into gansel 's press release .
" we are investigating the legal situation concerning the statement and will continue monitoring closely political statements using extremist language , " she said .

11 - the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month , and went down in history as the moment , every year , when the world remembers the dead .
but not many combat veterans will be in attendance at tuesday 's ceremonies .
today , there are few surviving members of the british forces that joined france , russia and italy in the battle against germany and the other central powers .
erich kastner , the last of the german troops , died on jan .
1 this year , aged 107 .
the last french veteran , italian-born legionnaire lazare ponticelli , survived him by only two months , dying on march 12 , aged 110 .
one of the five remaining british veterans died last week at the age of 108 in australia , where he moved in 1928 , the bbc reported .
sydney maurice lucas , who was born in leicester , england , on sept .
21 , 1900 , regularly led the annual anzac day parade in melbourne , said the report .
he was among the last batch of conscripts to be called up in aug . , 1918 .
in world war ii , he volunteered for the australian army in june 1940 and was posted to a machine-gun unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciliation : france 's mitterand and germany 's kohl at verdun in 1984 australia is also home to another of the known world war i survivors , 107-year-old claude choules .
meanwhile , three of the veterans still alive in britain are expected to attend this year 's official celebrations .
henry allingham , 112 , harry patch , 110 and bill stone , 108 , are scheduled to lead a two-minute period of silence at a ceremony in london .
the fight against forgetting but even though few eye witnesses are still alive , " to forget would be the worst thing , " as france 's minister for veterans ' affairs jean-marie bockel said last week .
" now that the last -lrb- french -rrb- veteran has gone , 90 years on we once more share a moment of awareness .
this war is part of our collective memory , and he who does not know his past has no future , " he said , inaugurating a memorial .
france 's president nicolas sarkozy , britain 's prince charles , the speaker of the german parliament peter mueller and australia 's governor general quentin bryce will hold a solemn ceremony of remembrance on tuesday .
they will meet at fort douaumont , epicenter of the 1916 battle of verdun , for speeches and prayers at the ossuary where the remains lie of 300,000 men cut down by machine-gun and artillery fire in 300 days and nights of hell .
afterwards , sarkozy will visit the nearby german cemetery .
but in a break with tradition , will not commemorate the event at the tomb of the unknown soldier under the arc de triomphe in the heart of paris .
too many memorial days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb of the unknown soldier is the arc de triomphe , paris while sarkozy is busy paying tribute to the war 's victims , a government-commissioned report said the country should cut back on the number of official memorial days .
world war i , fought in large part on their home soil , cost more than 1.4 million french lives between 1914 and 1918 .
with 11 other national days ranging from memorials to the dead of france 's colonial wars in algeria and indochina to the abolition of slavery , complaints have been made that official commemoration has gone overboard .
" it is not healthy that within half a century , the number of commemorations has doubled , " said the report of the commission headed by historian andre kaspi .
the commission recommends retaining armistice day , the may 8 celebration to mark the defeat of nazi germany , and the bastille day celebration on july 14 , relegating the other commemorations to local or regional events , reported reuters . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

particularly in the rhineland , carnival has been ushered in with much fanfare since the 19th century - something that has to do with the magical " fool 's number . "
since the middle ages , the number 11 has been considered the number of sin , and associated with court jesters and fools .
from nov .
11 , many clubs in the region begin organizing dances , comedy shows and other performances in the lead up to a short suspension of festivities over advent and christmas .

martin of tours was a roman soldier who went on to become a monk around the end of the fourth century .
it was said that jesus came to saint martin in a dream after the latter had , so the story goes , cut his coat in half to give to a beggar during a spot of bad weather .

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .
" you ca n't build a business model just on banking secrecy . "
so when obama takes office in january , the first cracks may begin to appear in the proverbial wall of silence around switzerland 's banking industry . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .

in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .
" you ca n't build a business model just on banking secrecy . "
so when obama takes office in january , the first cracks may begin to appear in the proverbial wall of silence around switzerland 's banking industry . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 11.11.2008 nuclear transport protests particularly violent , say police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convoy of 11 nuclear waste containers arrived in gorleben a train carrying nuclear waste has finally reached its destination in gorleben , germany , where the radioactive material is to be stored .
but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .

drawn up by the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the zew index rose to minus 53.5 , rebounding from minus 63 in october amid signs that an element of calm has returned to global share markets after weeks of chaotic selling .
analysts had forecast that the indicator would remain at about minus 63 in october .
the survey represents a key test of sentiment in europe 's biggest economy amid fallout from the world financial crisis .
shoring up confidence the 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan and the 500-billion-euro bank rescue package unveiled by chancellor angela merkel 's government in recent weeks also helped to steady investor nerves .
in addition , the release of the zew survey came in the wake of a wave of global rate cuts and a weaker euro against the us dollar .
" the earlier pessimistic expectations of the financial market experts are confirmed by the current economic development in germany , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the survey 's release .
" the experts , however , seem hopeful that the collective actions of governments and central banks will mitigate the economic slowdown , " he added .
well below historical average the release of the zew survey comes after the index plunged in october amid deepening economic fears following the global share market sell off .
however , the zew indicator still remains well below its historical average of 27.1 points .
the release of the index comes ahead of the publication on thursday of official data showing germany slumping into a recession during the third quarter .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , with analysts expecting that upcoming figures from germany 's statistics office to show a further 0.1 percent contraction in the quarter which ended september 30 .
as a result , germany will fulfill the technical definition of recession after clocking up two consecutive quarters of negative growth . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .

" police spokesman willy marcel higiro told afp that the demonstrators numbered around 7,500 . the protestors marched from the heavily-protected german embassy to the offices of germany 's international broadcaster deutsche welle , on the outskirts of kigali . at around lunchtime , cars drove across the capital blaring out messages announcing that all offices were closed for the afternoon and urging civil servants and members of the public to join the demonstrations .
rwandan security forces in riot gear kept an eye on the protesters . rwanda said the arrest warrant for kabuye was a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government . " germany justifies arrest rose kabuye , chief of protocol for rwandan president paul kagame , was arrested at a frankfurt airport on sunday on an international warrant issued by france in 2006 . france wants to question her about her alleged involvement in the 1994 plane crash that killed then-president juvenal habyarimana .
the crash led to 100 days of genocidal killing in rwanda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyaza cemetery outside kigali commemorates the victims of the 1994 genocide but a spokesman for the foreign ministry in berlin said german officials had been obliged to arrest kabuye . " the arrest warrant was binding and obligatory for the german government and the police .
against this backdrop we had no other choice than to make the arrest , " ministry spokesman jens ploettner said . the rwandan government said kabuye was traveling on official government business when she was arrested .
however , hildegard becker-toussaint , a state prosecutor in hesse , told reuters : " she came in the company of another private individual who did not have any diplomatic status . " becker-toussaint also added that kabuye was accused of a serious crime due to the suspected involvement in the 1994 plane crash : " she allegedly participated in the planning and execution of that .
this means if the allegations are true , she participated in a terror attack and the manslaughter of several people . " kabuye facing extradition according to ministry spokesman jens ploettner , rose kabuye will be extradited from germany to france within weeks . kabuye 's lawyer , lef forster , told reuters in paris that his client was willing to go before a french judge . " she believes there are no charges , " forster said , adding that his client denied any involvement in the april 6 , 1994 attack . dw staff -lrb- ew -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .

human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .

she is wanted for questioning by a french judge in conjunction with the country 's genocide in 1994 . thousands of people gathered outside the german embassy in kigali on monday as rwanda made a formal protest .
standing in driving rain , the people chanted " free rose , free rose . " some protestors waved signs reading " france : your days of lies are numbered " and " germany : why do n't you arrest genocidaires on your soil . " police spokesman willy marcel higiro told afp that the demonstrators numbered around 7,500 . the protestors marched from the heavily-protected german embassy to the offices of germany 's international broadcaster deutsche welle , on the outskirts of kigali . at around lunchtime , cars drove across the capital blaring out messages announcing that all offices were closed for the afternoon and urging civil servants and members of the public to join the demonstrations .
rwandan security forces in riot gear kept an eye on the protesters . rwanda said the arrest warrant for kabuye was a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government . " germany justifies arrest rose kabuye , chief of protocol for rwandan president paul kagame , was arrested at a frankfurt airport on sunday on an international warrant issued by france in 2006 . france wants to question her about her alleged involvement in the 1994 plane crash that killed then-president juvenal habyarimana .
the crash led to 100 days of genocidal killing in rwanda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyaza cemetery outside kigali commemorates the victims of the 1994 genocide but a spokesman for the foreign ministry in berlin said german officials had been obliged to arrest kabuye . " the arrest warrant was binding and obligatory for the german government and the police .
against this backdrop we had no other choice than to make the arrest , " ministry spokesman jens ploettner said . the rwandan government said kabuye was traveling on official government business when she was arrested .
however , hildegard becker-toussaint , a state prosecutor in hesse , told reuters : " she came in the company of another private individual who did not have any diplomatic status . " becker-toussaint also added that kabuye was accused of a serious crime due to the suspected involvement in the 1994 plane crash : " she allegedly participated in the planning and execution of that .
this means if the allegations are true , she participated in a terror attack and the manslaughter of several people . " kabuye facing extradition according to ministry spokesman jens ploettner , rose kabuye will be extradited from germany to france within weeks . kabuye 's lawyer , lef forster , told reuters in paris that his client was willing to go before a french judge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .

germans of all ages begin anticipating a good dose of debauchery and revelry ahead of the sobriety of lent .
particularly in the rhineland , carnival has been ushered in with much fanfare since the 19th century - something that has to do with the magical " fool 's number . "
since the middle ages , the number 11 has been considered the number of sin , and associated with court jesters and fools .

and that 's the modern concept of carnival : unwind and be foolish .
in fact a common carnival battle cry is , " anyone who is not a fool at carnival is foolish for the rest of the year . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 11.11.2008 germany 's " fifth season " begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people come together to celebrate carnival in big german cities in many parts of germany , 11:11 am on nov .
11 marks the start of carnival , a season of controlled debauchery and uncontrolled drinking that climaxes during the days preceding ash wednesday . at 11:11 on nov .
11 , an always colorful crowd in cologne 's alter markt square really gets raucous .
it 's at this moment that plans for the " fifth season " - carnival - officially get rolling and party starts , at least for a while .
germans of all ages begin anticipating a good dose of debauchery and revelry ahead of the sobriety of lent .
particularly in the rhineland , carnival has been ushered in with much fanfare since the 19th century - something that has to do with the magical " fool 's number . "
since the middle ages , the number 11 has been considered the number of sin , and associated with court jesters and fools .
from nov .
11 , many clubs in the region begin organizing dances , comedy shows and other performances in the lead up to a short suspension of festivities over advent and christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival celebrations can take on a political tone in the city of cologne , for example , carnival peaks when around one million people use the fifth season as an excuse to get raucously drunk in bars , on the streets , on buses and on trains .
in fact , one would be challenged to find any public space during this period where people were n't standing around gulping down beer and endulging in general merryment .
and that 's the modern concept of carnival : unwind and be foolish .
in fact a common carnival battle cry is , " anyone who is not a fool at carnival is foolish for the rest of the year . "
here one day , gone the next but perhaps the greatest oddity of carnival is the scary ease with which society returns to normal , daily life immediately after the celebrations conclude .
business people , some of whom only one day prior had been drinking in the streets dressed as clowns and giant bumble bees , pack trams on the way to work and look down to find empty beer bottles rolling back and forth on the floor , all the while seeming as though they would have no idea what had transpired over the previous days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne becomes clown-city during carnival this , of course , all comes at the business end of carnival , on and around the thursday before ash wednesday , the first day of lent .
the jocularity reaches its peak with the rose monday parades on feb .
23 .
saint martin 's day but the celebration 's official launch date , nov .
11 , actually represents a more austere event - saint martin 's day , which during the middle ages heralded a 40-day fast both preceded and followed by hearty celebrations with much drinking and eating .
martin of tours was a roman soldier who went on to become a monk around the end of the fourth century .
it was said that jesus came to saint martin in a dream after the latter had , so the story goes , cut his coat in half to give to a beggar during a spot of bad weather .
in the dream , martin heard jesus whisper to the angels : " here is martin , the roman soldier who is not baptized .
he has clothed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for young and old to this day , children take to the streets and go from house to house at night carrying paper lanterns and candles in search of sweets : the more innocent of the two ways of remembering martin 's charity .
the other way : use martin 's generosity as the starting point of a carnival that spans winter and culminates in a weekend bender the following february .
for at no other point throughout the calender does a better opportunity arise to get ridiculously drunk , sing loudly and charge through the streets in masks ringing bells to drive away evil spirits . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 11.11.2008 nuclear transport protests particularly violent , say police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convoy of 11 nuclear waste containers arrived in gorleben a train carrying nuclear waste has finally reached its destination in gorleben , germany , where the radioactive material is to be stored .
but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 11.11.2008 nuclear transport protests particularly violent , say police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the convoy of 11 nuclear waste containers arrived in gorleben a train carrying nuclear waste has finally reached its destination in gorleben , germany , where the radioactive material is to be stored .
but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .

" africa conquers the white house " is the heading of a statement issued from the office of the npd deputy juergen gansel from the eastern german state of saxony .
the npd has never cleared the five-percent minimum for representation in the german bundestag on a national parliamentary level , but the party holds seats in two regional states in eastern germany , where its anti-semitic and anti-immigrant platform has attracted a following among disaffected youth and the unemployed .
gansel characterized obama 's election triumph as " the american alliance of jews and negroes " and even condemned the german public for their outpouring of enthusiasm for the us president-elect , who was born to a white american mother and a kenyan father .
" many people in the ' diverse ' republic germany have been swept up in obama fever which resembles an african tropical disease , " he said .
deirdre berger , who is the director of the american jewish committee 's -lrb- ajc -rrb- office in berlin told afp news agency that she was shocked by gansel 's " open expression of racism , anti-semitism and anti-americanism . "
she said the ajc hoped german authorities would look into gansel 's press release .
" we are investigating the legal situation concerning the statement and will continue monitoring closely political statements using extremist language , " she said .

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .

" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .

under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .

11 marks the start of carnival , a season of controlled debauchery and uncontrolled drinking that climaxes during the days preceding ash wednesday . at 11:11 on nov .
11 , an always colorful crowd in cologne 's alter markt square really gets raucous .
it 's at this moment that plans for the " fifth season " - carnival - officially get rolling and party starts , at least for a while .
germans of all ages begin anticipating a good dose of debauchery and revelry ahead of the sobriety of lent .
particularly in the rhineland , carnival has been ushered in with much fanfare since the 19th century - something that has to do with the magical " fool 's number . "
since the middle ages , the number 11 has been considered the number of sin , and associated with court jesters and fools .

and that 's the modern concept of carnival : unwind and be foolish .
in fact a common carnival battle cry is , " anyone who is not a fool at carnival is foolish for the rest of the year . "

martin of tours was a roman soldier who went on to become a monk around the end of the fourth century .
it was said that jesus came to saint martin in a dream after the latter had , so the story goes , cut his coat in half to give to a beggar during a spot of bad weather .

" africa conquers the white house " is the heading of a statement issued from the office of the npd deputy juergen gansel from the eastern german state of saxony .
the npd has never cleared the five-percent minimum for representation in the german bundestag on a national parliamentary level , but the party holds seats in two regional states in eastern germany , where its anti-semitic and anti-immigrant platform has attracted a following among disaffected youth and the unemployed .
gansel characterized obama 's election triumph as " the american alliance of jews and negroes " and even condemned the german public for their outpouring of enthusiasm for the us president-elect , who was born to a white american mother and a kenyan father .
" many people in the ' diverse ' republic germany have been swept up in obama fever which resembles an african tropical disease , " he said .
deirdre berger , who is the director of the american jewish committee 's -lrb- ajc -rrb- office in berlin told afp news agency that she was shocked by gansel 's " open expression of racism , anti-semitism and anti-americanism . "
she said the ajc hoped german authorities would look into gansel 's press release .
" we are investigating the legal situation concerning the statement and will continue monitoring closely political statements using extremist language , " she said .
" we urge state authorities to do their utmost within legal bounds to prosecute such incitement , " she added . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 , actually represents a more austere event - saint martin 's day , which during the middle ages heralded a 40-day fast both preceded and followed by hearty celebrations with much drinking and eating .
martin of tours was a roman soldier who went on to become a monk around the end of the fourth century .
it was said that jesus came to saint martin in a dream after the latter had , so the story goes , cut his coat in half to give to a beggar during a spot of bad weather .
in the dream , martin heard jesus whisper to the angels : " here is martin , the roman soldier who is not baptized .
he has clothed me . "

the other way : use martin 's generosity as the starting point of a carnival that spans winter and culminates in a weekend bender the following february .

she is wanted for questioning by a french judge in conjunction with the country 's genocide in 1994 . thousands of people gathered outside the german embassy in kigali on monday as rwanda made a formal protest .
standing in driving rain , the people chanted " free rose , free rose . " some protestors waved signs reading " france : your days of lies are numbered " and " germany : why do n't you arrest genocidaires on your soil . " police spokesman willy marcel higiro told afp that the demonstrators numbered around 7,500 . the protestors marched from the heavily-protected german embassy to the offices of germany 's international broadcaster deutsche welle , on the outskirts of kigali . at around lunchtime , cars drove across the capital blaring out messages announcing that all offices were closed for the afternoon and urging civil servants and members of the public to join the demonstrations .
rwandan security forces in riot gear kept an eye on the protesters . rwanda said the arrest warrant for kabuye was a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government . " germany justifies arrest rose kabuye , chief of protocol for rwandan president paul kagame , was arrested at a frankfurt airport on sunday on an international warrant issued by france in 2006 . france wants to question her about her alleged involvement in the 1994 plane crash that killed then-president juvenal habyarimana .
the crash led to 100 days of genocidal killing in rwanda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyaza cemetery outside kigali commemorates the victims of the 1994 genocide but a spokesman for the foreign ministry in berlin said german officials had been obliged to arrest kabuye . " the arrest warrant was binding and obligatory for the german government and the police .
against this backdrop we had no other choice than to make the arrest , " ministry spokesman jens ploettner said . the rwandan government said kabuye was traveling on official government business when she was arrested .
however , hildegard becker-toussaint , a state prosecutor in hesse , told reuters : " she came in the company of another private individual who did not have any diplomatic status . " becker-toussaint also added that kabuye was accused of a serious crime due to the suspected involvement in the 1994 plane crash : " she allegedly participated in the planning and execution of that .
this means if the allegations are true , she participated in a terror attack and the manslaughter of several people . " kabuye facing extradition according to ministry spokesman jens ploettner , rose kabuye will be extradited from germany to france within weeks . kabuye 's lawyer , lef forster , told reuters in paris that his client was willing to go before a french judge . " she believes there are no charges , " forster said , adding that his client denied any involvement in the april 6 , 1994 attack . dw staff -lrb- ew -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

drawn up by the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the zew index rose to minus 53.5 , rebounding from minus 63 in october amid signs that an element of calm has returned to global share markets after weeks of chaotic selling .
analysts had forecast that the indicator would remain at about minus 63 in october .
the survey represents a key test of sentiment in europe 's biggest economy amid fallout from the world financial crisis .
shoring up confidence the 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan and the 500-billion-euro bank rescue package unveiled by chancellor angela merkel 's government in recent weeks also helped to steady investor nerves .
in addition , the release of the zew survey came in the wake of a wave of global rate cuts and a weaker euro against the us dollar .
" the earlier pessimistic expectations of the financial market experts are confirmed by the current economic development in germany , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the survey 's release .
" the experts , however , seem hopeful that the collective actions of governments and central banks will mitigate the economic slowdown , " he added .
well below historical average the release of the zew survey comes after the index plunged in october amid deepening economic fears following the global share market sell off .
however , the zew indicator still remains well below its historical average of 27.1 points .
the release of the index comes ahead of the publication on thursday of official data showing germany slumping into a recession during the third quarter .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , with analysts expecting that upcoming figures from germany 's statistics office to show a further 0.1 percent contraction in the quarter which ended september 30 .
as a result , germany will fulfill the technical definition of recession after clocking up two consecutive quarters of negative growth . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.11.2008 experts : obama will demand end to swiss banking secrecy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama could start calling for the swiss to change their banking ways the majority of swiss were in favor of barack obama 's candidacy .
but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .
" you ca n't build a business model just on banking secrecy . "
so when obama takes office in january , the first cracks may begin to appear in the proverbial wall of silence around switzerland 's banking industry . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .

" the earlier pessimistic expectations of the financial market experts are confirmed by the current economic development in germany , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the survey 's release .

10 , that efforts to defend europe 's car industry would resemble in some way the expected us approach to its own auto sector crisis .
european governments " ca n't avoid seeing what the americans are doing " and could not afford to let europe 's automobile sector " disappear , " juncker told radio france inter .
calls for subsidized low-cost loans the efforts come as german carmakers look to chancellor angela merkel 's government for signs it will provide further relief for its embattled auto industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has warned it is slowly running out of operating cash german carmaker opel has asked for tax incentives for new car purchases , the introduction of low-cost consumer loans and a bonus for taking cars more than 10 years old off the road .
the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .
the requests were made only a week after the german government said it would implement a series of support measures including cancelling the road tax for new car owners for one or two years .
" the measures presented are a first step but are not enough to underpin demand for new cars by families with weak or modest incomes , " said a letter sent friday by opel chief hans demant , works committee head klaus franz and general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- europe boss carl-peter forster .
opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .
ford , the second largest auto firm in the us , also reported substantial losses and said it would cut 10 percent of its north american labor costs , which equates to substantial layoffs .
the carmaker said it had lost $ 129 million in the third quarter of 2008 .

" a healthy automobile manufacturing sector is essential to the restoration of financial market stability , the overall health of our economy and the livelihood of the automobile sector 's workforce , " said speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid .
on friday , obama called the auto industry the " backbone of american manufacturing , " signalling his intention to help detroit under his presidency , which begins jan .
20 .
" washington needs to look at fast-forwarding the $ 25 billion that has been provided for retooling the factories for basically a more fuel-efficient auto fleet , " said obama 's chief of staff , congressman rahm emanuel , referring to an aid package recently authorized by congress for the car industry .
but automakers have asked for more help , insisting they need another $ 25 billion - on top of the aid package for improving fuel efficiency - to stave off what they say could be their imminent collapse . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .

the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .

" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "
" if our predictions are correct 50 percent of the time then we could say the system was successful , " he went on .
" other tsunami early-warning systems such as those that exist in the pacific regularly issue false alarms . "

" the indonesian meteorological and geophysical services were able to issue a warning 15 to 20 minutes before the wave hit , " said lauterjung .
all the buoys should be installed by early 2009 , and the german team will remain in indonesia another year to help train local staff .
" i believe we need to work on the system with our indonesian counterparts for another few years and to continue training , " said lauterjung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 11.11.2008 germany , indonesia launch tsunami early-warning system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses buoys to detect changes in sea conditions - and possible tsunamis nearly four years after the devastating asian tsunami of december 2004 which claimed 230,000 lives , an early-warning system developed and funded with german assistance is set to begin operation . indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono will attend tuesday 's ceremony in jakarta along with representatives of the german government , the german research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- said .
the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .
the gfz said the death toll would have been considerably lower if an early warning system had been in place at the time .
avoiding the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buoys can detect the waves when they 're still far out at sea the system about to be launched makes use of sensors placed on the seabed which relay details of changes in water pressure to buoys on the surface .
the information is then transmitted via satellite to a tsunami early-warning center in indonesia .
the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .
" the central question is knowing how to interpret the data so that we can say with complete certainty that a tsunami is coming or not - and predicting what effect it will have , " said stefan dech , director of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen and head of the " early warning and situation center , risk modeling and earth observation " project team .
" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "
" if our predictions are correct 50 percent of the time then we could say the system was successful , " he went on .
" other tsunami early-warning systems such as those that exist in the pacific regularly issue false alarms . "
educating the public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next step is to ensure that the public knows what to do when a tsunami is detected the gitews projects can already point to one success - the bengkulu earthquake off sumatra on sept .
12 , 2007 , when it was possible to obtain a first " heads-up " alert after less than two minutes and a first estimate of location , depth range and magnitude after two-and-a-half minutes .
" the indonesian meteorological and geophysical services were able to issue a warning 15 to 20 minutes before the wave hit , " said lauterjung .
all the buoys should be installed by early 2009 , and the german team will remain in indonesia another year to help train local staff .
" i believe we need to work on the system with our indonesian counterparts for another few years and to continue training , " said lauterjung .
" this is a very long-term project .
our indonesian partners also have to educate the population in terms of how they should react to a warning , and this is a huge task . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" not on the guest list but lech walesa - a nobel peace prize winner and anti-communist icon - was not invited to an evening gala due to a long-standing tension with polish president lech kaczynski . walesa became a hero to many after leading the strikes in the gdansk shipyards that challenged poland 's communist regime in the 1980s .
then in 2000 , he won a court case that proved his innocence against allegations of his cooperation with communist secret police . but kaczynski has said he knows walesa was a communist spy , while former prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - the president 's twin brother - said he has seen original documents that prove walesa 's guilt . prime minister donald tusk , however , came to walesa 's defense recently and said he feared right-wing politicians such as the kaczynski twins were using such theories for their own gains . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .

the automaker said around $ 52 billion -lrb- 40 billion euros -rrb- would be needed to set up and finance the low-cost consumer loans which could be managed by the european investment bank .

opel is a subsidiary of us auto giant gm , which itself is facing one of its worst years to date due to decreased sales , job cuts and the credit crunch .
gm issued a stark warning saturday insisting it was running out of the minimum amount of cash it needed to operate until the end of the year after posting third-quarter operating losses of $ 4.2 billion .

she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government financed the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 58 million -rrb- project , known as the german-indonesian tsunami early warning system , or gitews .
the devastating tsunami four years ago was triggered by an earthquake that measured 9.3 on the richter scale off the coast of the indonesian island of sumatra .
the gfz said the death toll would have been considerably lower if an early warning system had been in place at the time .
avoiding the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buoys can detect the waves when they 're still far out at sea the system about to be launched makes use of sensors placed on the seabed which relay details of changes in water pressure to buoys on the surface .
the information is then transmitted via satellite to a tsunami early-warning center in indonesia .
the german government proposed developing an early-warning system shortly in cooperation with indonesia after the disaster struck .
the backbone of the system is ten large yellow steel buoys which monitor the water and seabed and flash news of changes to authorities .
" were a tsunami to cross a sensor then the pressure would change , " said joern lauterjung , project coordinator at the gfz .
" this pressure can be measured very exactly . "
reacting fast the new system also boasts 20 stations where sea levels can be measured , using some 100 seismometers and global positioning system satellites to detect tremors .
collected data is sent to a headquarters , where experts have to be ready to make instant decisions based on the information they receive .
the tsunami warnings have to be issued preferably within five minutes .
they will be based on rapidly determined earthquake parameters and pre-calculated tsunami scenarios .
" the central question is knowing how to interpret the data so that we can say with complete certainty that a tsunami is coming or not - and predicting what effect it will have , " said stefan dech , director of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen and head of the " early warning and situation center , risk modeling and earth observation " project team .
" our experts have at most ten minutes to reach conclusions and issue a warning . "
" if our predictions are correct 50 percent of the time then we could say the system was successful , " he went on .
" other tsunami early-warning systems such as those that exist in the pacific regularly issue false alarms . "
educating the public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next step is to ensure that the public knows what to do when a tsunami is detected the gitews projects can already point to one success - the bengkulu earthquake off sumatra on sept .
12 , 2007 , when it was possible to obtain a first " heads-up " alert after less than two minutes and a first estimate of location , depth range and magnitude after two-and-a-half minutes .
" the indonesian meteorological and geophysical services were able to issue a warning 15 to 20 minutes before the wave hit , " said lauterjung .
all the buoys should be installed by early 2009 , and the german team will remain in indonesia another year to help train local staff .
" i believe we need to work on the system with our indonesian counterparts for another few years and to continue training , " said lauterjung .
" this is a very long-term project .
our indonesian partners also have to educate the population in terms of how they should react to a warning , and this is a huge task . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor put aside differences with moscow in the spirit of mutual cooperation . german chancellor angela merkel extended an olive branch to russia at an annual conference hosted by the german atlantic society in berlin on monday , nov .
10 .
she said that nato needed to reach out to moscow in the run up-to a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the trans-atlantic alliance next april to be held in both germany and france . both nato and russia need to work together in addressing global security concerns , the chancellor emphasized .
" i think it is better to talk with each other rather than about each other , " said merkel , who has been a vocal critic of russia on human rights issues .
in the past , merkel has even said she welcomed the prospect of georgia and ukraine joining the nato alliance , a stance that russia vehemently opposes .
but this time she focused more on cooperation with germany 's giant eastern neighbour .
" i know it is not always easy but i think it would be wise to send out a signal to russia , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel puts aside differences with russia 's dmitry medvedev earlier , the european union had agreed to re-launch its stalled talks with russia on a wide-ranging partnership pact after negotiations had been frozen following moscow 's brief incursion into neighboring georgia in a violent conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia last august .
" we need each other .
we are partners , " reiterated merkel , saying that russia and nato together were a more powerful force against terrorism , nuclear proliferation and other security challenges .
trans-atlantic ties under obama merkel also said she looked forward to strengthening the trans-atlantic partnership with barack obama , who would be attending the april summit for the first time as us president .
the president-elect is likely to ask germany for military and economic assistance in fighting taliban insurgents once he takes office , but merkel reassured her countrymen last week that she would resist any call from obama to commit german troops in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
merkel , however , sharply rejected public pressure to set a time limit on withdrawing german troops already deployed as part of nato 's international security assistance force , saying that they should remain until afghanistan “ can stand on its own two feet . ”
the german contingent of nato 's isaf is based in the quieter north of the country .
fighting militants and civilian reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel resists committing more troops to fight the taliban the chancellor added that the isaf mission in afghanistan was a clear example of the security gains that could be made by not only fighting militants , but developing civilian infrastructure at the same time .
merkel explained that the only approach that would work in afghanistan was " networked security " provided by both military and civilian elements .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also underscored merkel 's point that military deployments and civilian reconstruction were not mutually exclusive from each other and expressed confidence that nato and the eu would work closely together under obama 's administration .
" like his predecessors , the new president will make a review of policy , " said de hoop scheffer in a speech at the same conference sponsored by the german atlantic society , a non-governmental organization that promotes public support for nato and its partnership for peace countries .
" at such a time , it is not surprising if the united states will consider europe a privileged partner .
i see no need to worry , " he said , adding that common security concerns bound the west together .
" nato is at the core of the trans-atlantic community .

" africa conquers the white house " is the heading of a statement issued from the office of the npd deputy juergen gansel from the eastern german state of saxony .
the npd has never cleared the five-percent minimum for representation in the german bundestag on a national parliamentary level , but the party holds seats in two regional states in eastern germany , where its anti-semitic and anti-immigrant platform has attracted a following among disaffected youth and the unemployed .
gansel characterized obama 's election triumph as " the american alliance of jews and negroes " and even condemned the german public for their outpouring of enthusiasm for the us president-elect , who was born to a white american mother and a kenyan father .
" many people in the ' diverse ' republic germany have been swept up in obama fever which resembles an african tropical disease , " he said .
deirdre berger , who is the director of the american jewish committee 's -lrb- ajc -rrb- office in berlin told afp news agency that she was shocked by gansel 's " open expression of racism , anti-semitism and anti-americanism . "
she said the ajc hoped german authorities would look into gansel 's press release .
" we are investigating the legal situation concerning the statement and will continue monitoring closely political statements using extremist language , " she said .
" we urge state authorities to do their utmost within legal bounds to prosecute such incitement , " she added . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" police spokesman willy marcel higiro told afp that the demonstrators numbered around 7,500 . the protestors marched from the heavily-protected german embassy to the offices of germany 's international broadcaster deutsche welle , on the outskirts of kigali . at around lunchtime , cars drove across the capital blaring out messages announcing that all offices were closed for the afternoon and urging civil servants and members of the public to join the demonstrations .

but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .

human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .
“ the us gave us the marshall plan , they helped berlin with the airlift .
we have every reason to help the americans and to take these people in is a step in the right direction , ” said marianne heuwagen , director of human rights watch germany .
amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" africa conquers the white house " is the heading of a statement issued from the office of the npd deputy juergen gansel from the eastern german state of saxony .
the npd has never cleared the five-percent minimum for representation in the german bundestag on a national parliamentary level , but the party holds seats in two regional states in eastern germany , where its anti-semitic and anti-immigrant platform has attracted a following among disaffected youth and the unemployed .
gansel characterized obama 's election triumph as " the american alliance of jews and negroes " and even condemned the german public for their outpouring of enthusiasm for the us president-elect , who was born to a white american mother and a kenyan father .
" many people in the ' diverse ' republic germany have been swept up in obama fever which resembles an african tropical disease , " he said .
deirdre berger , who is the director of the american jewish committee 's -lrb- ajc -rrb- office in berlin told afp news agency that she was shocked by gansel 's " open expression of racism , anti-semitism and anti-americanism . "
she said the ajc hoped german authorities would look into gansel 's press release .
" we are investigating the legal situation concerning the statement and will continue monitoring closely political statements using extremist language , " she said .
" we urge state authorities to do their utmost within legal bounds to prosecute such incitement , " she added . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is wanted for questioning by a french judge in conjunction with the country 's genocide in 1994 . thousands of people gathered outside the german embassy in kigali on monday as rwanda made a formal protest .
standing in driving rain , the people chanted " free rose , free rose . " some protestors waved signs reading " france : your days of lies are numbered " and " germany : why do n't you arrest genocidaires on your soil . " police spokesman willy marcel higiro told afp that the demonstrators numbered around 7,500 . the protestors marched from the heavily-protected german embassy to the offices of germany 's international broadcaster deutsche welle , on the outskirts of kigali . at around lunchtime , cars drove across the capital blaring out messages announcing that all offices were closed for the afternoon and urging civil servants and members of the public to join the demonstrations .
rwandan security forces in riot gear kept an eye on the protesters . rwanda said the arrest warrant for kabuye was a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government . " germany justifies arrest rose kabuye , chief of protocol for rwandan president paul kagame , was arrested at a frankfurt airport on sunday on an international warrant issued by france in 2006 . france wants to question her about her alleged involvement in the 1994 plane crash that killed then-president juvenal habyarimana .

against this backdrop we had no other choice than to make the arrest , " ministry spokesman jens ploettner said . the rwandan government said kabuye was traveling on official government business when she was arrested .
however , hildegard becker-toussaint , a state prosecutor in hesse , told reuters : " she came in the company of another private individual who did not have any diplomatic status . " becker-toussaint also added that kabuye was accused of a serious crime due to the suspected involvement in the 1994 plane crash : " she allegedly participated in the planning and execution of that .
this means if the allegations are true , she participated in a terror attack and the manslaughter of several people . " kabuye facing extradition according to ministry spokesman jens ploettner , rose kabuye will be extradited from germany to france within weeks . kabuye 's lawyer , lef forster , told reuters in paris that his client was willing to go before a french judge .

drawn up by the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the zew index rose to minus 53.5 , rebounding from minus 63 in october amid signs that an element of calm has returned to global share markets after weeks of chaotic selling .
analysts had forecast that the indicator would remain at about minus 63 in october .
the survey represents a key test of sentiment in europe 's biggest economy amid fallout from the world financial crisis .
shoring up confidence the 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan and the 500-billion-euro bank rescue package unveiled by chancellor angela merkel 's government in recent weeks also helped to steady investor nerves .
in addition , the release of the zew survey came in the wake of a wave of global rate cuts and a weaker euro against the us dollar .
" the earlier pessimistic expectations of the financial market experts are confirmed by the current economic development in germany , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the survey 's release .
" the experts , however , seem hopeful that the collective actions of governments and central banks will mitigate the economic slowdown , " he added .
well below historical average the release of the zew survey comes after the index plunged in october amid deepening economic fears following the global share market sell off .
however , the zew indicator still remains well below its historical average of 27.1 points .
the release of the index comes ahead of the publication on thursday of official data showing germany slumping into a recession during the third quarter .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , with analysts expecting that upcoming figures from germany 's statistics office to show a further 0.1 percent contraction in the quarter which ended september 30 .
as a result , germany will fulfill the technical definition of recession after clocking up two consecutive quarters of negative growth . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2008 european governments asked to help us close guantanamo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us detention center at guantanamo bay has been the target of global criticism us president-elect obama has promised to shutter guantanamo , although how he ’ ll do so remains unclear .
human rights groups are holding him to his word and asking european nations for their support once the prison closes . “ as president , i will close guantánamo , reject the military commissions act , and adhere to the geneva conventions , ” then-candidate barack obama told a crowd of supporters in august of 2007 .
with a long campaign behind him and a few months before he enters the white house , the us president-elect will be pressed to make good on a number of campaign promises , including , as he said last year , closing the us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba .
just how he ’ ll do that , however , remains uncertain .
laurence tribe , a harvard law professor and obama legal adviser , told the associated press that discussions about how to handle the controversial detention center had been “ theoretical ” before the election .
still , tribe admitted , the issue would quickly come into focus , as closing the prison is a top priority .
" in reality and symbolically , the idea that we have people in legal black holes is an extremely serious black mark , " tribe said .
" it has to be dealt with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-rights groups are calling for an end to the military tribunal process as obama and his advisers contemplate just how best to deal with a legal anomaly that has blighted the country ’ s reputation over the last seven years , experts say this campaign promise is not one to renege on .
" if the president-elect is serious about building bridges with allies and demonstrating core american values , it 's what people are going to be looking to see , " bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert at georgetown university told afp news agency .
many steps to be taken still , the question of how best to close the prison is not an easy one to answer .
deciding what to do with the 255 detainees still held there could prove a logistical and political nightmare .
though the number of inmates at the camp is down from the 390 counted at the end of 2006 , only two have been held to account before a military tribunal - the legal structure outlined in the military commissions act that obama said he rejects .
the current administration likewise says it only intends to charge another 80 detainees with war crimes .
that leaves more than two-thirds of the prisoners as yet uncharged .
at least 60 of them have already been cleared for transfer out of guantanamo but remain there in limbo , waiting for countries willing to take them in .
persecution of ex-detainees last month , ahead of the us elections , the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- said it worried about the fate of guantanamo detainees who have been cleared of all suspicion of terrorist activity but who can not return to their home countries because they risk persecution .
“ we have to remember that the us does not admit they ’ ve made a mistake , ” said cori crider , a staff attorney for the london-based charity reprieve , which offers legal counsel to 35 or so of the detainees .
“ they hand over the prisoner along with his file .
these untested , unproven allegations follow our clients back to their home countries . ”
working with the documents in these files - which may include coerced confessions made under duress - security agents in each country are allowed to determine what happens to the detainee next .
and depending on the country , the detainee may be subjected to further imprisonment or torture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , the us supreme court ordered a halt to the return of a tunisian national because of torture fears “ closing guantanamo shouldn ’ t be an excuse to transfer human rights violations elsewhere , ” said daniel gorevan , a campaign manager with amnesty international .
together with other human rights ngos , amnesty international is calling on european governments to help prevent further human rights violations by taking in those nationals most vulnerable to persecution if returned to their home countries .
“ there are at least 50 detainees that the us will not or does not want to charge but they can not transfer them to their home countries , ” said gorevan .
nationals of china , algeria , tunisia , russia and uzbekistan were pointed out as especially at risk .
halting guantanamo practices as proof of this heightened risk , crider told the story of abdullah bin omar al hadi , one of her clients who was released from guantanamo and returned to tunisia , despite his lawyer ’ s warning to the us that al hadi would be tortured upon his return .
on the day of his arrival , al hadi was taken to the ministry of interior in tunis , arrested , hit , drugged and threatened with the rape of his wife and daughter .
during his time at guantanamo , crider said , her client said the confession he signed was coerced , a result of beatings .
it was later used by tunisia to jail al hadi for seven years , following a trial in which his lawyer was shouted down and threatened .
it ’ s practices like these , said gorevan , that need to be taken into account before detainees are released .
“ this isn ’ t just about closing those detention facilities but -lrb- halting -rrb- the practices that those facilities embody . ”
europe 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resettlement would not include any so-called " high value " cases - only those determined innocent one of the ways europe can help speed up the closure of guantanamo , said gorevan , is to take in those most at risk of persecution if returned to their home countries .
so far , only albania has granted asylum to three former detainees from china .

amnesty international 's gorevan cited the repatriation of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who spent four years in the camp as one relatively successful example of life-after-guantanamo .
“ european governments can offer them international protection and reintegrate them into society , ” he said .
though the process of integrating a non-native torture victim into european society would be quite different from the repatriation process , gorevan said the large diaspora populations across europe could help the released feel more at home .
and while the released detainees require quite a bit of support in the resettlement process , crider said , the denmark-based international rehabilitation council for torture victims has pledged its support to the initiative . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.11.2008 experts : obama will demand end to swiss banking secrecy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama could start calling for the swiss to change their banking ways the majority of swiss were in favor of barack obama 's candidacy .
but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .
" you ca n't build a business model just on banking secrecy . "
so when obama takes office in january , the first cracks may begin to appear in the proverbial wall of silence around switzerland 's banking industry . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

drawn up by the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the zew index rose to minus 53.5 , rebounding from minus 63 in october amid signs that an element of calm has returned to global share markets after weeks of chaotic selling .
analysts had forecast that the indicator would remain at about minus 63 in october .
the survey represents a key test of sentiment in europe 's biggest economy amid fallout from the world financial crisis .
shoring up confidence the 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan and the 500-billion-euro bank rescue package unveiled by chancellor angela merkel 's government in recent weeks also helped to steady investor nerves .
in addition , the release of the zew survey came in the wake of a wave of global rate cuts and a weaker euro against the us dollar .
" the earlier pessimistic expectations of the financial market experts are confirmed by the current economic development in germany , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the survey 's release .
" the experts , however , seem hopeful that the collective actions of governments and central banks will mitigate the economic slowdown , " he added .
well below historical average the release of the zew survey comes after the index plunged in october amid deepening economic fears following the global share market sell off .
however , the zew indicator still remains well below its historical average of 27.1 points .
the release of the index comes ahead of the publication on thursday of official data showing germany slumping into a recession during the third quarter .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , with analysts expecting that upcoming figures from germany 's statistics office to show a further 0.1 percent contraction in the quarter which ended september 30 .
as a result , germany will fulfill the technical definition of recession after clocking up two consecutive quarters of negative growth . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nobody gave it to us , nobody won the second republic -lrb- of poland -rrb- for us . " " our country is developing , and we realized our strategic goals - to enter nato and enter the european union . " not on the guest list but lech walesa - a nobel peace prize winner and anti-communist icon - was not invited to an evening gala due to a long-standing tension with polish president lech kaczynski . walesa became a hero to many after leading the strikes in the gdansk shipyards that challenged poland 's communist regime in the 1980s .
then in 2000 , he won a court case that proved his innocence against allegations of his cooperation with communist secret police . but kaczynski has said he knows walesa was a communist spy , while former prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - the president 's twin brother - said he has seen original documents that prove walesa 's guilt . prime minister donald tusk , however , came to walesa 's defense recently and said he feared right-wing politicians such as the kaczynski twins were using such theories for their own gains . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

drawn up by the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the zew index rose to minus 53.5 , rebounding from minus 63 in october amid signs that an element of calm has returned to global share markets after weeks of chaotic selling .
analysts had forecast that the indicator would remain at about minus 63 in october .
the survey represents a key test of sentiment in europe 's biggest economy amid fallout from the world financial crisis .
shoring up confidence the 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan and the 500-billion-euro bank rescue package unveiled by chancellor angela merkel 's government in recent weeks also helped to steady investor nerves .
in addition , the release of the zew survey came in the wake of a wave of global rate cuts and a weaker euro against the us dollar .
" the earlier pessimistic expectations of the financial market experts are confirmed by the current economic development in germany , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the survey 's release .
" the experts , however , seem hopeful that the collective actions of governments and central banks will mitigate the economic slowdown , " he added .
well below historical average the release of the zew survey comes after the index plunged in october amid deepening economic fears following the global share market sell off .
however , the zew indicator still remains well below its historical average of 27.1 points .
the release of the index comes ahead of the publication on thursday of official data showing germany slumping into a recession during the third quarter .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , with analysts expecting that upcoming figures from germany 's statistics office to show a further 0.1 percent contraction in the quarter which ended september 30 .
as a result , germany will fulfill the technical definition of recession after clocking up two consecutive quarters of negative growth . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 - the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month , and went down in history as the moment , every year , when the world remembers the dead .
but not many combat veterans will be in attendance at tuesday 's ceremonies .
today , there are few surviving members of the british forces that joined france , russia and italy in the battle against germany and the other central powers .
erich kastner , the last of the german troops , died on jan .
1 this year , aged 107 .
the last french veteran , italian-born legionnaire lazare ponticelli , survived him by only two months , dying on march 12 , aged 110 .
one of the five remaining british veterans died last week at the age of 108 in australia , where he moved in 1928 , the bbc reported .
sydney maurice lucas , who was born in leicester , england , on sept .
21 , 1900 , regularly led the annual anzac day parade in melbourne , said the report .
he was among the last batch of conscripts to be called up in aug . , 1918 .
in world war ii , he volunteered for the australian army in june 1940 and was posted to a machine-gun unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciliation : france 's mitterand and germany 's kohl at verdun in 1984 australia is also home to another of the known world war i survivors , 107-year-old claude choules .
meanwhile , three of the veterans still alive in britain are expected to attend this year 's official celebrations .
henry allingham , 112 , harry patch , 110 and bill stone , 108 , are scheduled to lead a two-minute period of silence at a ceremony in london .
the fight against forgetting but even though few eye witnesses are still alive , " to forget would be the worst thing , " as france 's minister for veterans ' affairs jean-marie bockel said last week .
" now that the last -lrb- french -rrb- veteran has gone , 90 years on we once more share a moment of awareness .
this war is part of our collective memory , and he who does not know his past has no future , " he said , inaugurating a memorial .
france 's president nicolas sarkozy , britain 's prince charles , the speaker of the german parliament peter mueller and australia 's governor general quentin bryce will hold a solemn ceremony of remembrance on tuesday .
they will meet at fort douaumont , epicenter of the 1916 battle of verdun , for speeches and prayers at the ossuary where the remains lie of 300,000 men cut down by machine-gun and artillery fire in 300 days and nights of hell .
afterwards , sarkozy will visit the nearby german cemetery .
but in a break with tradition , will not commemorate the event at the tomb of the unknown soldier under the arc de triomphe in the heart of paris .
too many memorial days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb of the unknown soldier is the arc de triomphe , paris while sarkozy is busy paying tribute to the war 's victims , a government-commissioned report said the country should cut back on the number of official memorial days .
world war i , fought in large part on their home soil , cost more than 1.4 million french lives between 1914 and 1918 .
with 11 other national days ranging from memorials to the dead of france 's colonial wars in algeria and indochina to the abolition of slavery , complaints have been made that official commemoration has gone overboard .
" it is not healthy that within half a century , the number of commemorations has doubled , " said the report of the commission headed by historian andre kaspi .
the commission recommends retaining armistice day , the may 8 celebration to mark the defeat of nazi germany , and the bastille day celebration on july 14 , relegating the other commemorations to local or regional events , reported reuters . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 marks the start of carnival , a season of controlled debauchery and uncontrolled drinking that climaxes during the days preceding ash wednesday . at 11:11 on nov .
11 , an always colorful crowd in cologne 's alter markt square really gets raucous .
it 's at this moment that plans for the " fifth season " - carnival - officially get rolling and party starts , at least for a while .
germans of all ages begin anticipating a good dose of debauchery and revelry ahead of the sobriety of lent .
particularly in the rhineland , carnival has been ushered in with much fanfare since the 19th century - something that has to do with the magical " fool 's number . "
since the middle ages , the number 11 has been considered the number of sin , and associated with court jesters and fools .
from nov .
11 , many clubs in the region begin organizing dances , comedy shows and other performances in the lead up to a short suspension of festivities over advent and christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carnival celebrations can take on a political tone in the city of cologne , for example , carnival peaks when around one million people use the fifth season as an excuse to get raucously drunk in bars , on the streets , on buses and on trains .
in fact , one would be challenged to find any public space during this period where people were n't standing around gulping down beer and endulging in general merryment .
and that 's the modern concept of carnival : unwind and be foolish .
in fact a common carnival battle cry is , " anyone who is not a fool at carnival is foolish for the rest of the year . "
here one day , gone the next but perhaps the greatest oddity of carnival is the scary ease with which society returns to normal , daily life immediately after the celebrations conclude .
business people , some of whom only one day prior had been drinking in the streets dressed as clowns and giant bumble bees , pack trams on the way to work and look down to find empty beer bottles rolling back and forth on the floor , all the while seeming as though they would have no idea what had transpired over the previous days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne becomes clown-city during carnival this , of course , all comes at the business end of carnival , on and around the thursday before ash wednesday , the first day of lent .
the jocularity reaches its peak with the rose monday parades on feb .
23 .
saint martin 's day but the celebration 's official launch date , nov .
11 , actually represents a more austere event - saint martin 's day , which during the middle ages heralded a 40-day fast both preceded and followed by hearty celebrations with much drinking and eating .
martin of tours was a roman soldier who went on to become a monk around the end of the fourth century .
it was said that jesus came to saint martin in a dream after the latter had , so the story goes , cut his coat in half to give to a beggar during a spot of bad weather .
in the dream , martin heard jesus whisper to the angels : " here is martin , the roman soldier who is not baptized .
he has clothed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for young and old to this day , children take to the streets and go from house to house at night carrying paper lanterns and candles in search of sweets : the more innocent of the two ways of remembering martin 's charity .
the other way : use martin 's generosity as the starting point of a carnival that spans winter and culminates in a weekend bender the following february .
for at no other point throughout the calender does a better opportunity arise to get ridiculously drunk , sing loudly and charge through the streets in masks ringing bells to drive away evil spirits . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was a long , eventful trip . thousands of protesters held up a truck convoy carrying nuclear waste in germany monday , repeatedly invading a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- road leading to a secure storage warehouse .
police said the protests , the biggest since 2001 during the waste transport operations , which take place every few months , were also more violent than usual .
protesters had tried to undermine a railway , seize a truck and shot signalling flares at a police helicopter .
federal police commander thomas osterroth said , " a few of them are willing to be very violent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protestors were peaceful , but police said some were prepared for violence the 10,000 police at the scene were ordered to clear the road before the trucks departed from a railway freight yard carrying the 11 containers .
they were bound for the storage site at gorleben where tons of similar waste are already guarded round the clock .
the big containers are a new type , code-named tn 85 , with shells designed to withstand greater heat from the high-grade waste , the remains of uranium fuel rods used in german nuclear power stations .
greenpeace claims containers are dangerous the environmentalist group greenpeace charged that neutron radiation from the containers was 40 percent greater .
state regulators rejected this , saying their tests showed the radiation remained within the legally safe limit .
about 1,000 protesters who blocked the entrance to the warehouse were carried away one by one by riot police .
police said they faced a major challenge removing eight demonstrators who had chained themselves to concrete blocks near the site .
on saturday it took 12 hours to drill out concrete and remove three protesters who chained themselves to a railtrack on the french border before the waste passed on a train .
the train carried the waste from a reprocessing plant la hague , france to a railhead in the town of dannenberg , close to gorleben .
nuclear energy debate in germany about 15,000 protesters defied a storm to camp out near gorleben .
they said the large turnout was prompted by debate in germany about returning to nuclear power for the sake of reduced carbon-dioxide emissions .
the protesters , who reject nuclear power as unsafe , aim to draw attention to the issue by disrupting the convoys .
under legislation , germany is to close all its nuclear power plants within the next 15 years .
the german government has said little about the protests .
but dieter althaus , premier of thuringia state , said monday the protesters were breaching a national consensus to end nuclear power and store away the waste . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nobody gave it to us , nobody won the second republic -lrb- of poland -rrb- for us . " " our country is developing , and we realized our strategic goals - to enter nato and enter the european union . " not on the guest list but lech walesa - a nobel peace prize winner and anti-communist icon - was not invited to an evening gala due to a long-standing tension with polish president lech kaczynski . walesa became a hero to many after leading the strikes in the gdansk shipyards that challenged poland 's communist regime in the 1980s .
then in 2000 , he won a court case that proved his innocence against allegations of his cooperation with communist secret police . but kaczynski has said he knows walesa was a communist spy , while former prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski - the president 's twin brother - said he has seen original documents that prove walesa 's guilt . prime minister donald tusk , however , came to walesa 's defense recently and said he feared right-wing politicians such as the kaczynski twins were using such theories for their own gains . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.11.2008 experts : obama will demand end to swiss banking secrecy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama could start calling for the swiss to change their banking ways the majority of swiss were in favor of barack obama 's candidacy .
but now that he 's been elected , they may find out that they 'll be asked to make more changes , especially in the financial sector , than they bargained for . going after tax havens was a minor part of obama 's campaign platform .
but with america mired in which some are calling the worst economic crisis since the great depression , switzerland has every reason to believe that the president-elect means business on this issue .
in 2007 , as illinois senator , obama co-sponsored a piece of legislation called the " tax-haven abuse act , " which named switzerland as one of 34 countries us citizens might be using to evade taxes .
that proposed legislation , which attempted to close fiscal loopholes , did not become law .
but experts almost unanimously agree that an obama-led washington will urge switzerland to abandon its tradition of strict banking confidentiality - which is seen as facilitating tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax authorities around the world want more cooperation " the pressure on switzerland will definitely increase now , " martin naville , the head of the swiss-american chamber of commerce , told the swiss daily newspaper der tagesanzeiger .
" anyone who wants to get switzerland out of the firing line ca n't go with empty hands . "
the tradition of swiss banking secrecy goes back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking tax cheats .
but even the swiss government admits that it may now have to amend those rules .
" it is clear that fiscal questions will come to the forefront and we have to face them , as much from the european union as from the united states , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the swiss daily newspaper tribune de geneve .
" that is the logical consequence of the financial crisis , " calmy-rey said , saying many countries would want to crack down on tax evaders as a means of paying for their national economic bailout plans .
according to an estimate by the boston consulting group , around 27 percent of the world 's undeclared assets - $ 2 trillion - are held in switzerland .
transatlantic pressure bildunterschrift : western nations are pumping in billions to keep their economies rolling increasing switzerland 's worries is that fact that the eu will likely support obama if he does indeed intend to ratchet up the pressure on bern .
in october , german finance minister peer steinbrueck called for switzerland to be placed on the office for economic cooperation and development 's black list of countries that were not cooperating in the international fight against tax evasion .
french president nicolas sarkozy has also called for the eradication of tax havens .
indeed , the pressure has already started .
us authorities are currently investigating whether the swiss bank ubs helped wealthy americans hide their money from the internal revenue service .
the swiss finance ministry has denied us newspaper reports that data concerning some 70 americans had been turned over .
but experts think that , in the long term , switzerland will have no choice but to give in .
" the economic pressure on switzerland will be enormous if the eu and the united states pursue it together , " matthias graf von krockow of the german bank sal .
oppenheim told the german business weekly , bilanz .
" you ca n't build a business model just on banking secrecy . "
so when obama takes office in january , the first cracks may begin to appear in the proverbial wall of silence around switzerland 's banking industry . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aye than said she was not allowed to attend the trial and nay phone latt was not represented by his defence lawyer , aung thein , who began serving a four-month prison sentence for contempt of court last friday .
" my son is a computer expert and he has not violated any criminal law .
it is very unfair that he was given 15 years ' imprisonment under the electronics law for a crime he did not commit , " said aye than .
a spokesman for the opposition national league for democracy party , nyan win , described nay phone latt , a former party member , as " a young and intelligent blogger and computer expert . "
spreading arrests " the government is expediting the trials of political prisoners and many have been given lengthy prison sentences , " said nyan win .
nyan win said party youth member tun tun naing , who was arrested last year , was given 19 years in prison on friday .
tun tun naing and khin maung aye , of the privately-owned weekly news watch , were arrested on 5 november and are being detained in insein prison .
the media rights organisations reporters without borders and burma media association have demanded their immediate release , adding this brings to 10 the number of journalists arrested so far this year .
irrawaddy magazine , an exile burmese news organisation , said the current crackdown is also aimed at silencing legal attempts to ensure fair trials for dissidents now appearing before judges in closed court sessions .
two weeks ago , three defence lawyers , nyi nyi htwe , aung thein and khin maung shein were imprisoned for between four and six months for contempt of court after complaining of unfair treatment .
four other defence lawyers , kyaw hoe , maung maung latt , myint thaung and khin htay kyew have been barred from representing their clients , who include members of the 88 generation students group .
the us state department has criticised the imprisonment of the four defence lawyers and urged the burmese regime to drop all charges and release them .
president bush announced that he will nominate one of his former senior asia advisers as special representative for burma .
' no legitimacy ' the european union said on monday that multiparty elections scheduled for 2010 in burma will be seen as illegitimate unless the ruling military junta frees all political prisoners - particularly nobel laureate aung san suu kyi .
the 27 eu foreign ministers deplored the lack of progress in burma since the violent repression of peaceful protests .
suu kyi , a nobel peace prize laureate , has been under house arrest for more than 12 of the past 19 years .
the junta has announced general elections in 2010 as part of its " roadmap to democracy " .
the junta came to power in 1988 after crushing a nationwide pro-democracy uprising , killing as many as 3,000 people .
it organised multiparty elections in 1990 but refused to honour the results after suu kyi 's party won overwhelmingly .

wales has a larger elderly population than the rest of the uk , putting increasing strain on the care system .
the consultation will run in parallel with one in england , prompted by predictions services will face a £ 6bn funding gap across the uk in 20 years .
it will consider whether individuals , families or society should contribute more towards care costs in the future .
questions will be asked , such as whether the care and support system should be the same for everybody or vary , according to circumstances or local priorities .
how best to strike a balance between targeting government resources to those least able to pay and having a system which encourages people to plan and save will also be investigated .
examples of care services meals on wheels home adaptations - such as grab rails and stair lifts housing support services - such as wardens benefits for disabled people day care residential care homes occupational therapy support for carers - including respite care the demographic trends over the next decade are worrying policy makers around the world .
in wales the population is projected to increase by about 5 % to 3.14m.
but while the number of children is expected to drop by 6 % over the period , the number of people aged 65 to 84 is set to rise by 24 % and those over 85 by around 29 % .
with older people making up an increasing section of the population , welsh ministers also want to gauge opinion on a variety of possible new funding models , including , private insurance , a national equity release scheme , a partnership model , free personal care and social insurance .
a private insurance system might be run along similar lines to the healthcare system in the usa .
an equity release scheme could allow people to pay for their care needs with money raised after their death by proceeds from the sale of their home . "
what 's important to remember is that the care system is n't something that only involves older people " deputy social services minister gwenda thomas the partnership model , suggested by the charitable foundation kings fund , could involved people paying £ 1 towards the costs for every £ 2 the state provides .
scotland provides free personal care services up to £ 216 per week for people aged 65 and over , but with means testing for accommodation and food costs .
the social insurance option is being pursued in japan and germany , and would involve a system similar to the way people in the uk pay national insurance contributions to qualify for social security benefits .
all the options are potentially highly controversial .
welsh deputy social services minister gwenda thomas said it was time to " think very carefully " about how the care system needed to change to ensure that future needs and demands are " appropriately met " .
complexity " what 's important to remember is that the care system is n't something that only involves older people in society - nearly all of us will one day come into contact with the care system in one form or another , " she said .
" it is therefore essential that as many people as possible - of all ages and backgrounds - join in the debate and have their say . "
the consultation will include events in cardiff and llandudno in december and january , and will run until march 2009 when a welsh " green paper " will be published , mapping out the assembly government 's first thoughts and ideas , but without any firm proposals .
this document would then feed into the uk government 's green paper published at westminster .
however welsh ministers are likely to want to retain as much flexibility as they can to adapt any new system to the needs in wales .
any changes are not expected to be made before 2011 at the very earliest .
given the scale and complexity of a care system made up of devolved and non-devolved elements combined with tax , health and benefits issues and reforms could take much longer .

wales has a larger elderly population than the rest of the uk , putting increasing strain on the care system .
the consultation will run in parallel with one in england , prompted by predictions services will face a £ 6bn funding gap across the uk in 20 years .
it will consider whether individuals , families or society should contribute more towards care costs in the future .
questions will be asked , such as whether the care and support system should be the same for everybody or vary , according to circumstances or local priorities .
how best to strike a balance between targeting government resources to those least able to pay and having a system which encourages people to plan and save will also be investigated .
examples of care services meals on wheels home adaptations - such as grab rails and stair lifts housing support services - such as wardens benefits for disabled people day care residential care homes occupational therapy support for carers - including respite care the demographic trends over the next decade are worrying policy makers around the world .
in wales the population is projected to increase by about 5 % to 3.14m.
but while the number of children is expected to drop by 6 % over the period , the number of people aged 65 to 84 is set to rise by 24 % and those over 85 by around 29 % .
with older people making up an increasing section of the population , welsh ministers also want to gauge opinion on a variety of possible new funding models , including , private insurance , a national equity release scheme , a partnership model , free personal care and social insurance .
a private insurance system might be run along similar lines to the healthcare system in the usa .
an equity release scheme could allow people to pay for their care needs with money raised after their death by proceeds from the sale of their home .
what 's important to remember is that the care system is n't something that only involves older people deputy social services minister gwenda thomas the partnership model , suggested by the charitable foundation kings fund , could involved people paying £ 1 towards the costs for every £ 2 the state provides .
scotland provides free personal care services up to £ 216 per week for people aged 65 and over , but with means testing for accommodation and food costs .
the social insurance option is being pursued in japan and germany , and would involve a system similar to the way people in the uk pay national insurance contributions to qualify for social security benefits .
all the options are potentially highly controversial .
welsh deputy social services minister gwenda thomas said it was time to " think very carefully " about how the care system needed to change to ensure that future needs and demands are " appropriately met " .
complexity " what 's important to remember is that the care system is n't something that only involves older people in society - nearly all of us will one day come into contact with the care system in one form or another , " she said .
" it is therefore essential that as many people as possible - of all ages and backgrounds - join in the debate and have their say . "
the consultation will include events in cardiff and llandudno in december and january , and will run until march 2009 when a welsh " green paper " will be published , mapping out the assembly government 's first thoughts and ideas , but without any firm proposals .
this document would then feed into the uk government 's green paper published at westminster .
however welsh ministers are likely to want to retain as much flexibility as they can to adapt any new system to the needs in wales .
any changes are not expected to be made before 2011 at the very earliest .
given the scale and complexity of a care system made up of devolved and non-devolved elements combined with tax , health and benefits issues and reforms could take much longer .

read a million words together will urge boys to read in different ways , using the internet and comics , and will focus on using men as role-models .
a £ 500,000 assembly government grant will also allow schools to buy more books for boys .
by the age of 15 , 18 % fewer boys reach the acceptable reading standard , compared to girls .
the campaign will target nine to 14-year-old boys and aims to encourage them to read with other boys and male members of their family .
john griffiths am , deputy minister for skills , said some boys ' struggle to read had " an impact on their overall levels of literacy and attainment " .
he will launch the scheme , developed by the assembly government 's basic skills cymru team , at the improving boys ' literacy conference in cardiff .
' family is key ' " a lack of positive role models and the assumption that reading is n't ' cool ' can have a damaging effect on boys ' willingness to pick up a book , " he said .
" i want to make sure that boys across wales know that men read , and through this campaign supported by stars such as cardiff city 's joe ledley and wales ' ryan jones i want to see boys pick up books , comics , sports programmes and much else , embracing all forms of reading .
" and family is key .
an essential part of the campaign is ensuring that male family members read with their sons , nephews , brothers and cousins , " he added .
at age seven , 10 % fewer boys reach the acceptable reading standard , compared to girls . "
they 'll need reading when they leave school , not just as an interest but in their everyday work " rhian jones , ysgol botwnnog , pwllheli by the time children reach the age of 15 , this figure almost doubles to 18 % .
ion thomas , a teacher and father of two sons said reading to boys helped them to know how to read for themselves .
" it 's important for one reason to make them more confident and also to enhance their vocabulary and their language , because as an adult you can read books that are a little more difficult or challenging and they become familiar with the text and that sort of literature , " he said .
" it opens the door of the imagination . "
rhian jones , a teacher at ysgol botwnnog in pwllheli , gwynedd , said the secondary school had set up a boys ' reading group because staff felt they were falling behind the girls .
" we 've created this club for them with the intention hopefully that they will enjoy coming here to read books , discuss books and so forth .
" they 've got all sorts of activities which take up their time , they 're always out playing football , watching television , computer games and all these modern devices , so reading is the least important , i think , in their daily lives .
" it is important that changes - obviously they 'll need reading when they leave school , not just as an interest but in their everyday work , " she said .
same problems as part of the campaign , copies of a book for teachers , me read no way ! , have been sent to every school in wales .
the book describes 13 ways to encourage boys to read in school and at home and is based on research by dr david booth of the university of toronto , who will address the conference .
dr booth said boys faced the same problems with literacy around the world .
" we 've compiled these issues from other documents , other research , other countries trying to come together with a plan to support boys .
" we 're taking a look and what we think boys need and what we think boys want and trying to blend the two into really strong programmes in our schools , " he added .
time troopers , a comic to develop boys ' interest in reading is also planned .

read a million words together will urge boys to read in different ways , using the internet and comics , and will focus on using men as role-models .
a £ 500,000 assembly government grant will also allow schools to buy more books for boys .
by the age of 15 , 18 % fewer boys reach the acceptable reading standard , compared to girls .
the campaign will target nine to 14-year-old boys and aims to encourage them to read with other boys and male members of their family .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
john griffiths am , deputy minister for skills , said some boys ' struggle to read had " an impact on their overall levels of literacy and attainment " .
he will launch the scheme , developed by the assembly government 's basic skills cymru team , at the improving boys ' literacy conference in cardiff .
' family is key ' " a lack of positive role models and the assumption that reading is n't ' cool ' can have a damaging effect on boys ' willingness to pick up a book , " he said .
" i want to make sure that boys across wales know that men read , and through this campaign supported by stars such as cardiff city 's joe ledley and wales ' ryan jones i want to see boys pick up books , comics , sports programmes and much else , embracing all forms of reading .
" and family is key .
an essential part of the campaign is ensuring that male family members read with their sons , nephews , brothers and cousins , " he added .
at age seven , 10 % fewer boys reach the acceptable reading standard , compared to girls .
they 'll need reading when they leave school , not just as an interest but in their everyday work rhian jones , ysgol botwnnog , pwllheli by the time children reach the age of 15 , this figure almost doubles to 18 % .
ion thomas , a teacher and father of two sons said reading to boys helped them to know how to read for themselves .
" it 's important for one reason to make them more confident and also to enhance their vocabulary and their language , because as an adult you can read books that are a little more difficult or challenging and they become familiar with the text and that sort of literature , " he said .
" it opens the door of the imagination . "
rhian jones , a teacher at ysgol botwnnog in pwllheli , gwynedd , said the secondary school had set up a boys ' reading group because staff felt they were falling behind the girls .
" we 've created this club for them with the intention hopefully that they will enjoy coming here to read books , discuss books and so forth .
" they 've got all sorts of activities which take up their time , they 're always out playing football , watching television , computer games and all these modern devices , so reading is the least important , i think , in their daily lives .
" it is important that changes - obviously they 'll need reading when they leave school , not just as an interest but in their everyday work , " she said .

mr nasheed beat maumoon abdul gayoom , who had ruled for 30 years , to win the country 's first democratic polls .
in his inaugural speech , mr nasheed promised to strengthen democracy and to combat poverty and drug abuse .
but he made no mention of his idea of saving the people of the indian ocean archipelago from rising sea levels by buying them a new homeland .
the maldives is the lowest nation in the world .
its highest land is little more than two metres above sea level .
the united nations estimates that sea levels may rise globally by nearly 60 centimetres this century .
earlier , mr nasheed had said the gradual rise in sea levels caused by global warming meant the islanders may eventually be forced to resettle elsewhere .
the maldives comprise more than 1,000 islands and coral atolls surrounded by the clear waters of the indian ocean .
imprisoned mr nasheed took his oath of office at a ceremony televised live from a convention centre in male .
the new president had been imprisoned more than 20 times by mr gayoom .
in the first multi-party elections held in the maldives , president gayoom won the first round last month , but failed to secure the 50 % needed for outright victory .
a run-off was held on 28 october which was won by mr nasheed .
mr nasheed said his victory over mr gayoom - asia 's longest-serving leader - showed the people of the maldives were embracing the future .
the election was the culmination of reforms in the indian ocean islands that followed pro-democracy street protests and international pressure .
mr gayoom , 71 , had ruled the maldives uncontested since 1978 , elected back into office six times by referendums .
mr gayoom 's supporters had credited him with overseeing an economic expansion fuelled by tourism .
but mr gayoom 's critics accused him of being dictatorial .

mr nasheed beat maumoon abdul gayoom , who had ruled for 30 years , to win the country 's first democratic polls .
in his inaugural speech , mr nasheed promised to strengthen democracy and to combat poverty and drug abuse .
but he made no mention of his idea of saving the people of the indian ocean archipelago from rising sea levels by buying them a new homeland .
the maldives is the lowest nation in the world .
its highest land is little more than two metres above sea level .
the united nations estimates that sea levels may rise globally by nearly 60 centimetres this century .
earlier , mr nasheed had said the gradual rise in sea levels caused by global warming meant the islanders may eventually be forced to resettle elsewhere .
the maldives comprise more than 1,000 islands and coral atolls surrounded by the clear waters of the indian ocean .
imprisoned mr nasheed took his oath of office at a ceremony televised live from a convention centre in male .
the new president had been imprisoned more than 20 times by mr gayoom .
mr gayoom thanked the people for allowing him to rule for 30 years in the first multi-party elections held in the maldives , president gayoom won the first round last month , but failed to secure the 50 % needed for outright victory .
a run-off was held on 28 october which was won by mr nasheed .
mr nasheed said his victory over mr gayoom - asia 's longest-serving leader - showed the people of the maldives were embracing the future .
the election was the culmination of reforms in the indian ocean islands that followed pro-democracy street protests and international pressure .
mr gayoom , 71 , had ruled the maldives uncontested since 1978 , elected back into office six times by referendums .
mr gayoom 's supporters had credited him with overseeing an economic expansion fuelled by tourism .
but mr gayoom 's critics accused him of being dictatorial .

mr nasheed beat maumoon abdul gayoom , who had ruled for 30 years , to win the country 's first democratic polls .
in his inaugural speech , mr nasheed promised to strengthen democracy and to combat poverty and drug abuse .
but he made no mention of his idea of saving the people of the indian ocean archipelago from rising sea levels by buying them a new homeland .
the maldives is the lowest nation in the world .
its highest land is little more than two metres above sea level .
the united nations estimates that sea levels may rise globally by nearly 60 centimetres this century .
earlier , mr nasheed had said the gradual rise in sea levels caused by global warming meant the islanders may eventually be forced to resettle elsewhere .
the maldives comprise more than 1,000 islands and coral atolls surrounded by the clear waters of the indian ocean .
imprisoned mr nasheed took his oath of office at a ceremony televised live from a convention centre in male .
the new president had been imprisoned more than 20 times by mr gayoom .
mr gayoom thanked the people for allowing him to rule for 30 years in the first multi-party elections held in the maldives , president gayoom won the first round last month , but failed to secure the 50 % needed for outright victory .
a run-off was held on 28 october which was won by mr nasheed .
mr nasheed said his victory over mr gayoom - asia 's longest-serving leader - showed the people of the maldives were embracing the future .
the election was the culmination of reforms in the indian ocean islands that followed pro-democracy street protests and international pressure .
mr gayoom , 71 , had ruled the maldives uncontested since 1978 , elected back into office six times by referendums .
mr gayoom 's supporters had credited him with overseeing an economic expansion fuelled by tourism .
but mr gayoom 's critics accused him of being dictatorial .

the cunard vessel , whose home port is southampton but which was built in clydebank , is to be converted into a floating hotel in dubai .
the qe2 attracted attention from the moment it was launched by the queen in 1967 .
since then , it has been been a troop carrier , hostess to royalty and witness to history .
hundreds of famous faces have graced its decks , including former south african president nelson mandela , us astronaut buzz aldrin , beatle george harrison and actress elizabeth taylor .
however , american beatrice muller from new jersey is probably the ship 's biggest star .
the 89-year-old has lived on the qe2 for nine years .
her husband died on board in 1999 and she moved in permanently nine months later , claiming it was cheaper than a retirement home .
now she has had to find a new home after it was announced in june last year that the ship had been bought by dubai world for $ 100m -lrb- £ 50.5m -rrb- .
according to the liner 's crew , the new owners in the gulf state plan to slice off its giant red funnel and replace it with a glass penthouse , creating the most exclusive hotel room in dubai .
record breaker there are few ships as iconic as the qe2 .
the 70,000-tonne vessel is one of the largest passenger ships afloat , with a top speed of 32.5 knots making it the fastest merchant ship in operation .
built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde , she was known only as " job number 736 " until she was officially launched by the queen .
the ship was not called after the present queen .
instead the number 2 in her title shows that she was the second ship named queen elizabeth .
the famous liner is 963ft -lrb- 293m -rrb- long , 105ft -lrb- 32m -rrb- wide and can carry as many as 1,778 passengers and more than 1,000 crew .
her first captain was bill warwick , who took her on her maiden voyage to las palmas , setting off on 22 april 1969 .
since then the qe2 has travelled more than 5.6 million nautical miles - more than any other ship and the equivalent of travelling to the moon and back 13 times , according to cunard .
the qe2 has also carried more than 2.5 million passengers , completed 25 world cruises , crossed the atlantic more than 800 times and is still the fastest merchant ship in operation - able to go faster backwards than most cruise ships can go forwards .
eventful history in 1971 the liner rescued passengers from another ship , the antilles , after it ran aground .
the sas and bomb disposal officers were scrambled to the ship in 1972 , 1,000 miles from land , in response to a bomb threat , which later turned out to be a hoax .
a year later , the vessel embarked on a cruise to israel to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the state 's founding .
because it was feared the liner would be a target in the fall-out of the 1972 munich olympics terror attack , 26 elite commandos joined the cruise , with many travelling incognito as passengers .
no threat emerged - but rumours persist to this day that egypt 's president anwar sadat prevented the ship being treated as a target by militants .
in 1982 the vessel was requisitioned as a troop carrier for the falklands war .
with 3,000 troops on board it set sail for south georgia on 12 may , arriving back in southampton safely on 11 june .
qe2 facts 963 feet -lrb- 293m -rrb- long carries 1,900 passengers and 1,000 crew crossed atlantic over 800 times top speed 32.5 knots in pictures : the qe2 in 1992 the qe2 stayed afloat after hitting uncharted rocks off massachusetts .
it also survived being hit by a 95ft -lrb- 30m -rrb- wave after running into hurricane luis in september 1995 .
the new 150,000-tonne queen mary 2 took over the qe2 's role as cunard 's flagship in 2004 .
the qe2 was vandalised by members of the crew in 2005 .
a 1969 tapestry of the royal family was thrown overboard in mid-atlantic and a portrait of the queen badly damaged during a staff party .
in january 2007 more than 300 people caught a highly infectious vomiting bug - the norovirus - while on board the qe2 .
it celebrated its 40th birthday with a round-britain cruise in september 2007 .
the ship conducted a farewell tour of the uk before setting out on its 805th , and last , transatlantic round crossing to new york on 10 october 2008 .
now it is to be moored to a pier in dubai 's palm jumeirah development - the world 's largest man-made island .
it is expected the funnel will be removed and placed on the waterfront as an entrance to the floating hotel .
every cabin will be ripped out and replaced with larger bedrooms , and the ship 's engines will be taken out to make room for a new entertainment venue .
the qe2 's predecessor , queen mary , has been a floating hotel at long beach in california since 1967 .
it has now been a tourist attraction longer than it was at sea .

the cunard vessel , whose home port is southampton but which was built in clydebank , is to be converted into a floating hotel in dubai .
the qe2 attracted attention from the moment it was launched by the queen in 1967 .
since then , it has been been a troop carrier , hostess to royalty and witness to history .
hundreds of famous faces have graced its decks , including former south african president nelson mandela , us astronaut buzz aldrin , beatle george harrison and actress elizabeth taylor .
however , american beatrice muller from new jersey is probably the ship 's biggest star .
the 89-year-old has lived on the qe2 for nine years .
her husband died on board in 1999 and she moved in permanently nine months later , claiming it was cheaper than a retirement home .
now she has had to find a new home after it was announced in june last year that the ship had been bought by dubai world for $ 100m -lrb- £ 50.5m -rrb- .
according to the liner 's crew , the new owners in the gulf state plan to slice off its giant red funnel and replace it with a glass penthouse , creating the most exclusive hotel room in dubai .
record breaker there are few ships as iconic as the qe2 .
the 70,000-tonne vessel is one of the largest passenger ships afloat , with a top speed of 32.5 knots making it the fastest merchant ship in operation .
the qe2 was built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde in scotland built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde , she was known only as " job number 736 " until she was officially launched by the queen .
the ship was not called after the present queen .
instead the number 2 in her title shows that she was the second ship named queen elizabeth .
the famous liner is 963ft -lrb- 293m -rrb- long , 105ft -lrb- 32m -rrb- wide and can carry as many as 1,778 passengers and more than 1,000 crew .
her first captain was bill warwick , who took her on her maiden voyage to las palmas , setting off on 22 april 1969 .
since then the qe2 has travelled more than 5.6 million nautical miles - more than any other ship and the equivalent of travelling to the moon and back 13 times , according to cunard .
the qe2 has also carried more than 2.5 million passengers , completed 25 world cruises , crossed the atlantic more than 800 times and is still the fastest merchant ship in operation - able to go faster backwards than most cruise ships can go forwards .
eventful history in 1971 the liner rescued passengers from another ship , the antilles , after it ran aground .
the sas and bomb disposal officers were scrambled to the ship in 1972 , 1,000 miles from land , in response to a bomb threat , which later turned out to be a hoax .
a year later , the vessel embarked on a cruise to israel to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the state 's founding .
because it was feared the liner would be a target in the fall-out of the 1972 munich olympics terror attack , 26 elite commandos joined the cruise , with many travelling incognito as passengers .
no threat emerged - but rumours persist to this day that egypt 's president anwar sadat prevented the ship being treated as a target by militants .
in 1982 the vessel was requisitioned as a troop carrier for the falklands war .
with 3,000 troops on board it set sail for south georgia on 12 may , arriving back in southampton safely on 11 june .
qe2 facts 963 feet -lrb- 293m -rrb- long carries 1,900 passengers and 1,000 crew crossed atlantic over 800 times top speed 32.5 knots in pictures : the qe2 in 1992 the qe2 stayed afloat after hitting uncharted rocks off massachusetts .
it also survived being hit by a 95ft -lrb- 30m -rrb- wave after running into hurricane luis in september 1995 .
the new 150,000-tonne queen mary 2 took over the qe2 's role as cunard 's flagship in 2004 .
the qe2 was vandalised by members of the crew in 2005 .
a 1969 tapestry of the royal family was thrown overboard in mid-atlantic and a portrait of the queen badly damaged during a staff party .
in january 2007 more than 300 people caught a highly infectious vomiting bug - the norovirus - while on board the qe2 .
it celebrated its 40th birthday with a round-britain cruise in september 2007 .
the ship conducted a farewell tour of the uk before setting out on its 805th , and last , transatlantic round crossing to new york on 10 october 2008 .
now it is to be moored to a pier in dubai 's palm jumeirah development - the world 's largest man-made island .
it is expected the funnel will be removed and placed on the waterfront as an entrance to the floating hotel .
every cabin will be ripped out and replaced with larger bedrooms , and the ship 's engines will be taken out to make room for a new entertainment venue .
the qe2 's predecessor , queen mary , has been a floating hotel at long beach in california since 1967 .
it has now been a tourist attraction longer than it was at sea .

according to the liner 's crew , the new owners in the gulf state plan to slice off its giant red funnel and replace it with a glass penthouse , creating the most exclusive hotel room in dubai .
record breaker there are few ships as iconic as the qe2 .
the 70,000-tonne vessel is one of the largest passenger ships afloat , with a top speed of 32.5 knots making it the fastest merchant ship in operation .
the qe2 was built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde in scotland built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde , she was known only as " job number 736 " until she was officially launched by the queen .
the ship was not called after the present queen .

the famous liner is 963ft -lrb- 293m -rrb- long , 105ft -lrb- 32m -rrb- wide and can carry as many as 1,778 passengers and more than 1,000 crew .

since then the qe2 has travelled more than 5.6 million nautical miles - more than any other ship and the equivalent of travelling to the moon and back 13 times , according to cunard .
the qe2 has also carried more than 2.5 million passengers , completed 25 world cruises , crossed the atlantic more than 800 times and is still the fastest merchant ship in operation - able to go faster backwards than most cruise ships can go forwards .
eventful history in 1971 the liner rescued passengers from another ship , the antilles , after it ran aground .
the sas and bomb disposal officers were scrambled to the ship in 1972 , 1,000 miles from land , in response to a bomb threat , which later turned out to be a hoax .
a year later , the vessel embarked on a cruise to israel to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the state 's founding .
because it was feared the liner would be a target in the fall-out of the 1972 munich olympics terror attack , 26 elite commandos joined the cruise , with many travelling incognito as passengers .
no threat emerged - but rumours persist to this day that egypt 's president anwar sadat prevented the ship being treated as a target by militants .
in 1982 the vessel was requisitioned as a troop carrier for the falklands war .
with 3,000 troops on board it set sail for south georgia on 12 may , arriving back in southampton safely on 11 june .

the new 150,000-tonne queen mary 2 took over the qe2 's role as cunard 's flagship in 2004 .
the qe2 was vandalised by members of the crew in 2005 .
a 1969 tapestry of the royal family was thrown overboard in mid-atlantic and a portrait of the queen badly damaged during a staff party .
in january 2007 more than 300 people caught a highly infectious vomiting bug - the norovirus - while on board the qe2 .

the ship conducted a farewell tour of the uk before setting out on its 805th , and last , transatlantic round crossing to new york on 10 october 2008 .
now it is to be moored to a pier in dubai 's palm jumeirah development - the world 's largest man-made island .
it is expected the funnel will be removed and placed on the waterfront as an entrance to the floating hotel .
every cabin will be ripped out and replaced with larger bedrooms , and the ship 's engines will be taken out to make room for a new entertainment venue .
the qe2 's predecessor , queen mary , has been a floating hotel at long beach in california since 1967 .
it has now been a tourist attraction longer than it was at sea .

the cunard vessel , whose home port is southampton but which was built in clydebank , is to be converted into a floating hotel in dubai .
the qe2 attracted attention from the moment it was launched by the queen in 1967 .
since then , it has been been a troop carrier , hostess to royalty and witness to history .
hundreds of famous faces have graced its decks , including former south african president nelson mandela , us astronaut buzz aldrin , beatle george harrison and actress elizabeth taylor .
however , american beatrice muller from new jersey is probably the ship 's biggest star .
the 89-year-old has lived on the qe2 for nine years .
her husband died on board in 1999 and she moved in permanently nine months later , claiming it was cheaper than a retirement home .
now she has had to find a new home after it was announced in june last year that the ship had been bought by dubai world for $ 100m -lrb- £ 50.5m -rrb- .
according to the liner 's crew , the new owners in the gulf state plan to slice off its giant red funnel and replace it with a glass penthouse , creating the most exclusive hotel room in dubai .
record breaker there are few ships as iconic as the qe2 .
the 70,000-tonne vessel is one of the largest passenger ships afloat , with a top speed of 32.5 knots making it the fastest merchant ship in operation .
the qe2 was built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde in scotland built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde , she was known only as " job number 736 " until she was officially launched by the queen .
the ship was not called after the present queen .
instead the number 2 in her title shows that she was the second ship named queen elizabeth .
the famous liner is 963ft -lrb- 293m -rrb- long , 105ft -lrb- 32m -rrb- wide and can carry as many as 1,778 passengers and more than 1,000 crew .
her first captain was bill warwick , who took her on her maiden voyage to las palmas , setting off on 22 april 1969 .
since then the qe2 has travelled more than 5.6 million nautical miles - more than any other ship and the equivalent of travelling to the moon and back 13 times , according to cunard .
the qe2 has also carried more than 2.5 million passengers , completed 25 world cruises , crossed the atlantic more than 800 times and is still the fastest merchant ship in operation - able to go faster backwards than most cruise ships can go forwards .
eventful history in 1971 the liner rescued passengers from another ship , the antilles , after it ran aground .
the sas and bomb disposal officers were scrambled to the ship in 1972 , 1,000 miles from land , in response to a bomb threat , which later turned out to be a hoax .
a year later , the vessel embarked on a cruise to israel to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the state 's founding .
because it was feared the liner would be a target in the fall-out of the 1972 munich olympics terror attack , 26 elite commandos joined the cruise , with many travelling incognito as passengers .
no threat emerged - but rumours persist to this day that egypt 's president anwar sadat prevented the ship being treated as a target by militants .
in 1982 the vessel was requisitioned as a troop carrier for the falklands war .
with 3,000 troops on board it set sail for south georgia on 12 may , arriving back in southampton safely on 11 june .
qe2 facts 963 feet -lrb- 293m -rrb- long carries 1,900 passengers and 1,000 crew crossed atlantic over 800 times top speed 32.5 knots in pictures : the qe2 in 1992 the qe2 stayed afloat after hitting uncharted rocks off massachusetts .
it also survived being hit by a 95ft -lrb- 30m -rrb- wave after running into hurricane luis in september 1995 .
the new 150,000-tonne queen mary 2 took over the qe2 's role as cunard 's flagship in 2004 .
the qe2 was vandalised by members of the crew in 2005 .
a 1969 tapestry of the royal family was thrown overboard in mid-atlantic and a portrait of the queen badly damaged during a staff party .
in january 2007 more than 300 people caught a highly infectious vomiting bug - the norovirus - while on board the qe2 .
it celebrated its 40th birthday with a round-britain cruise in september 2007 .
the ship conducted a farewell tour of the uk before setting out on its 805th , and last , transatlantic round crossing to new york on 10 october 2008 .
now it is to be moored to a pier in dubai 's palm jumeirah development - the world 's largest man-made island .
it is expected the funnel will be removed and placed on the waterfront as an entrance to the floating hotel .
every cabin will be ripped out and replaced with larger bedrooms , and the ship 's engines will be taken out to make room for a new entertainment venue .
the qe2 's predecessor , queen mary , has been a floating hotel at long beach in california since 1967 .
it has now been a tourist attraction longer than it was at sea .

now she has had to find a new home after it was announced in june last year that the ship had been bought by dubai world for $ 100m -lrb- £ 50.5m -rrb- .
according to the liner 's crew , the new owners in the gulf state plan to slice off its giant red funnel and replace it with a glass penthouse , creating the most exclusive hotel room in dubai .
record breaker there are few ships as iconic as the qe2 .
the 70,000-tonne vessel is one of the largest passenger ships afloat , with a top speed of 32.5 knots making it the fastest merchant ship in operation .
the qe2 was built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde in scotland built at the john brown shipyard on the clyde , she was known only as " job number 736 " until she was officially launched by the queen .
the ship was not called after the present queen .
instead the number 2 in her title shows that she was the second ship named queen elizabeth .
the famous liner is 963ft -lrb- 293m -rrb- long , 105ft -lrb- 32m -rrb- wide and can carry as many as 1,778 passengers and more than 1,000 crew .
her first captain was bill warwick , who took her on her maiden voyage to las palmas , setting off on 22 april 1969 .
since then the qe2 has travelled more than 5.6 million nautical miles - more than any other ship and the equivalent of travelling to the moon and back 13 times , according to cunard .
the qe2 has also carried more than 2.5 million passengers , completed 25 world cruises , crossed the atlantic more than 800 times and is still the fastest merchant ship in operation - able to go faster backwards than most cruise ships can go forwards .
eventful history in 1971 the liner rescued passengers from another ship , the antilles , after it ran aground .
the sas and bomb disposal officers were scrambled to the ship in 1972 , 1,000 miles from land , in response to a bomb threat , which later turned out to be a hoax .
a year later , the vessel embarked on a cruise to israel to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the state 's founding .
because it was feared the liner would be a target in the fall-out of the 1972 munich olympics terror attack , 26 elite commandos joined the cruise , with many travelling incognito as passengers .
no threat emerged - but rumours persist to this day that egypt 's president anwar sadat prevented the ship being treated as a target by militants .
in 1982 the vessel was requisitioned as a troop carrier for the falklands war .
with 3,000 troops on board it set sail for south georgia on 12 may , arriving back in southampton safely on 11 june .

it also survived being hit by a 95ft -lrb- 30m -rrb- wave after running into hurricane luis in september 1995 .
the new 150,000-tonne queen mary 2 took over the qe2 's role as cunard 's flagship in 2004 .
the qe2 was vandalised by members of the crew in 2005 .
a 1969 tapestry of the royal family was thrown overboard in mid-atlantic and a portrait of the queen badly damaged during a staff party .
in january 2007 more than 300 people caught a highly infectious vomiting bug - the norovirus - while on board the qe2 .
it celebrated its 40th birthday with a round-britain cruise in september 2007 .
the ship conducted a farewell tour of the uk before setting out on its 805th , and last , transatlantic round crossing to new york on 10 october 2008 .
now it is to be moored to a pier in dubai 's palm jumeirah development - the world 's largest man-made island .
it is expected the funnel will be removed and placed on the waterfront as an entrance to the floating hotel .
every cabin will be ripped out and replaced with larger bedrooms , and the ship 's engines will be taken out to make room for a new entertainment venue .
the qe2 's predecessor , queen mary , has been a floating hotel at long beach in california since 1967 .
it has now been a tourist attraction longer than it was at sea .

the violence of the last intifada has waned , but a gloomy picture of the holy city has emerged during campaigning for tuesday 's mayoral elections .
jerusalem residents give their views on the holy city in pictures soaring land prices , dirty streets , economic stagnation , job shortages , the flight of the city 's young people and secular jews and the construction of a light rail system that has caused traffic to all but grind to a halt are all common gripes .
it ranked bottom in a recent survey of the quality of life in israel 's 15 largest cities .
the future of jerusalem , home to some 740,000 people and a pilgrimage site for muslims , christians and jews , is hotly contested .
israelis see it as their capital , palestinians want to have theirs here too .
and though many of its residents have great affection for the city , it has a reputation in israel as a " religious , backwards town " , said student jay rosen , 27 , at a recent debate between the mayoral candidates .
" this is the capital and it needs to start acting like one , " said mr rosen .
mayoral candidates nir barkat secular high-tech businessman , leading in most polls meir porush ultra-orthodox rabbi , israeli mp since 1996 , former deputy housing minister , barkat 's closest challenger arkady gaydamak russian-born tycoon , owner of major israeli football club , currently on trial in absentia in an arms trafficking case in paris dan biron tv executive-turned-bar owner , left-wing candidate from party seeking legalisation of marijuana obstacles to peace : jerusalem diary : mayoral poster wars while many major world cities are swamped with new arrivals , about 5,000 more people leave jerusalem than move in each year .
raffi radovan , 35 , says he and about 10 of his close friends are among those who have left because they say the city is becoming too religious .
he now commutes from tel aviv to his job in an art gallery at the israel museum .
jerusalem 's ultra-orthodox , or haredi , community , with its large families and high birth rate , has grown from about a tenth of the city 's jewish population in the 1960s to between a quarter and a third .
but it is its growing influence in the municipality , and the spread of close-knit communities of black-hatted , strictly-observant haredim into previously secular and mixed neighbourhoods that causes most ire .
i feel less and less that this is my city raffi radovan , secular ex-jerusalemite mr radovan sighs as he talks of the hostile graffiti that appeared on the door of a small artspace he opened and his friend 's problems employing jews in his bar on the sabbath .
" i feel less and less that this is my city , " he says .
haredim are known for moving en-masse into secular or mixed neighbourhoods by paying above market value for apartments , pushing up prices .
with the new residents come fears that , like in long-standing haredi neighbourhoods , women dressed " immodestly " -lrb- which usually means not covered from neck to ankle and wrist , with trousers considered unacceptable -rrb- will be harassed .
they worry too that cars moving on the sabbath will be stoned , and newspapers and non-kosher food will disappear from the shops - which will be forced to close on saturdays .
" i just felt that you ca n't really fight it , " said mr radovan .
" it 's them and us - we are all jewish , but the way we think is different , the way we act , where we shop , it 's a totally different culture . "
the city 's religious make-up is changing the city - both its residents and the municipality - is the poorest in israel , according to israel kimhi of the jerusalem institute for israeli studies .
employment is low among ultra-orthodox men , many of whom study the torah rather than work .
it is also low among women in the roughly one third of the city 's population that is palestinian and israeli-arab .
this means less money flows through taxes into city coffers while , mr kimhi says , a weak private sectors adds to the woes .
spending on education per child is about a third - and the cultural budget less than a tenth - of that in tel aviv , according to figures quoted by mayoral candidates .
many haredis say their needs were previously overlooked " if the existing trends continue , jerusalem is going to decline , " says mr kimhi .
haredi journalist jonathan rosenblum points out that ultra-orthodox jews are strong contributors to state funds through sales taxes on the products they buy for their often large families .
he disagrees with the widespread perception that the outgoing haredi mayor has favoured his own community , arguing that its needs were previously overlooked .
and he points out that high apartment prices and lack of jobs also hit young ultra-orthodox couples , who are leaving the city too .
' hard struggle ' only a couple of kilometres away , with its potholed roads and scruffy buildings , predominantly palestinian east jerusalem is more obviously in decline .
fishmonger and father of six mazen hassounh , 43 , says he has lost of much of the custom he used to get from palestinians in the west bank .
mazen hassounh has considered closing his fish shop the israeli-built west bank barrier , which in places cuts through east jerusalem , has made it much harder for them to visit the city .
and while tourists are slowly returning after the intifada , most stay in west jerusalem , he says .
in some periods he makes a loss .
" it 's a hard struggle .
sometimes i think about closing the shop , " he says .
in comparison , business is booming for his brother-in-law who sells fish in the west bank town of ramallah , the seat of the palestinian authority .
at times mr hassounh contemplates following the many middle class palestinians who have relocated there - especially since , during the intifada , israel put a stop to all official pa activities in east jerusalem .
while ramallah 's restaurants thrive , " here , after 7pm it 's like a ghost city , " he says .
palestinians in east jerusalem suffer continued under-investment and difficulty getting building permits .
they say that from education to refuse collection , their israeli-run municipal services are way below the standard in the west of the city .
but most palestinians in east jerusalem boycott the mayoral elections , seeing participation as legitimising israel 's occupation of the east of the city in the 1967 .
the desire by both israelis and palestinians to have their capital in jerusalem is one of the most explosive issues in peace talks .
but while its residents wait for a compromise to be reached - if it ever is - many on both sides feel they are watching the city drift further from the vibrant , booming capital they want .

the violence of the last intifada has waned , but a gloomy picture of the holy city has emerged during campaigning for tuesday 's mayoral elections .

jerusalem 's ultra-orthodox , or haredi , community , with its large families and high birth rate , has grown from about a tenth of the city 's jewish population in the 1960s to between a quarter and a third .

" i feel less and less that this is my city , " he says .
haredim are known for moving en-masse into secular or mixed neighbourhoods by paying above market value for apartments , pushing up prices .
with the new residents come fears that , like in long-standing haredi neighbourhoods , women dressed " immodestly " -lrb- which usually means not covered from neck to ankle and wrist , with trousers considered unacceptable -rrb- will be harassed .

employment is low among ultra-orthodox men , many of whom study the torah rather than work .
it is also low among women in the roughly one third of the city 's population that is palestinian and israeli-arab .
this means less money flows through taxes into city coffers while , mr kimhi says , a weak private sectors adds to the woes .

haredi journalist jonathan rosenblum points out that ultra-orthodox jews are strong contributors to state funds through sales taxes on the products they buy for their often large families .
he disagrees with the widespread perception that the outgoing haredi mayor has favoured his own community , arguing that its needs were previously overlooked .
and he points out that high apartment prices and lack of jobs also hit young ultra-orthodox couples , who are leaving the city too .

mazen hassounh has considered closing his fish shop the israeli-built west bank barrier , which in places cuts through east jerusalem , has made it much harder for them to visit the city .
and while tourists are slowly returning after the intifada , most stay in west jerusalem , he says .
in some periods he makes a loss .

the violence of the last intifada has waned , but a gloomy picture of the holy city has emerged during campaigning for tuesday 's mayoral elections .
jerusalem residents give their views on the holy city in pictures soaring land prices , dirty streets , economic stagnation , job shortages , the flight of the city 's young people and secular jews and the construction of a light rail system that has caused traffic to all but grind to a halt are all common gripes .
it ranked bottom in a recent survey of the quality of life in israel 's 15 largest cities .
the future of jerusalem , home to some 740,000 people and a pilgrimage site for muslims , christians and jews , is hotly contested .
israelis see it as their capital , palestinians want to have theirs here too .
and though many of its residents have great affection for the city , it has a reputation in israel as a " religious , backwards town " , said student jay rosen , 27 , at a recent debate between the mayoral candidates .
" this is the capital and it needs to start acting like one , " said mr rosen .
mayoral candidates nir barkat secular high-tech businessman , leading in most polls meir porush ultra-orthodox rabbi , israeli mp since 1996 , former deputy housing minister , barkat 's closest challenger arkady gaydamak russian-born tycoon , owner of major israeli football club , currently on trial in absentia in an arms trafficking case in paris dan biron tv executive-turned-bar owner , left-wing candidate from party seeking legalisation of marijuana obstacles to peace : jerusalem diary : mayoral poster wars while many major world cities are swamped with new arrivals , about 5,000 more people leave jerusalem than move in each year .
raffi radovan , 35 , says he and about 10 of his close friends are among those who have left because they say the city is becoming too religious .
he now commutes from tel aviv to his job in an art gallery at the israel museum .
jerusalem 's ultra-orthodox , or haredi , community , with its large families and high birth rate , has grown from about a tenth of the city 's jewish population in the 1960s to between a quarter and a third .
but it is its growing influence in the municipality , and the spread of close-knit communities of black-hatted , strictly-observant haredim into previously secular and mixed neighbourhoods that causes most ire .
i feel less and less that this is my city raffi radovan , secular ex-jerusalemite mr radovan sighs as he talks of the hostile graffiti that appeared on the door of a small artspace he opened and his friend 's problems employing jews in his bar on the sabbath .
" i feel less and less that this is my city , " he says .
haredim are known for moving en-masse into secular or mixed neighbourhoods by paying above market value for apartments , pushing up prices .
with the new residents come fears that , like in long-standing haredi neighbourhoods , women dressed " immodestly " -lrb- which usually means not covered from neck to ankle and wrist , with trousers considered unacceptable -rrb- will be harassed .
they worry too that cars moving on the sabbath will be stoned , and newspapers and non-kosher food will disappear from the shops - which will be forced to close on saturdays .
" i just felt that you ca n't really fight it , " said mr radovan .
" it 's them and us - we are all jewish , but the way we think is different , the way we act , where we shop , it 's a totally different culture . "
the city 's religious make-up is changing the city - both its residents and the municipality - is the poorest in israel , according to israel kimhi of the jerusalem institute for israeli studies .
employment is low among ultra-orthodox men , many of whom study the torah rather than work .
it is also low among women in the roughly one third of the city 's population that is palestinian and israeli-arab .
this means less money flows through taxes into city coffers while , mr kimhi says , a weak private sectors adds to the woes .
spending on education per child is about a third - and the cultural budget less than a tenth - of that in tel aviv , according to figures quoted by mayoral candidates .
many haredis say their needs were previously overlooked " if the existing trends continue , jerusalem is going to decline , " says mr kimhi .
haredi journalist jonathan rosenblum points out that ultra-orthodox jews are strong contributors to state funds through sales taxes on the products they buy for their often large families .
he disagrees with the widespread perception that the outgoing haredi mayor has favoured his own community , arguing that its needs were previously overlooked .
and he points out that high apartment prices and lack of jobs also hit young ultra-orthodox couples , who are leaving the city too .
' hard struggle ' only a couple of kilometres away , with its potholed roads and scruffy buildings , predominantly palestinian east jerusalem is more obviously in decline .
fishmonger and father of six mazen hassounh , 43 , says he has lost of much of the custom he used to get from palestinians in the west bank .
mazen hassounh has considered closing his fish shop the israeli-built west bank barrier , which in places cuts through east jerusalem , has made it much harder for them to visit the city .
and while tourists are slowly returning after the intifada , most stay in west jerusalem , he says .

the violence of the last intifada has waned , but a gloomy picture of the holy city has emerged during campaigning for tuesday 's mayoral elections .
jerusalem residents give their views on the holy city in pictures soaring land prices , dirty streets , economic stagnation , job shortages , the flight of the city 's young people and secular jews and the construction of a light rail system that has caused traffic to all but grind to a halt are all common gripes .
it ranked bottom in a recent survey of the quality of life in israel 's 15 largest cities .
the future of jerusalem , home to some 740,000 people and a pilgrimage site for muslims , christians and jews , is hotly contested .
israelis see it as their capital , palestinians want to have theirs here too .
and though many of its residents have great affection for the city , it has a reputation in israel as a " religious , backwards town " , said student jay rosen , 27 , at a recent debate between the mayoral candidates .
" this is the capital and it needs to start acting like one , " said mr rosen .
mayoral candidates nir barkat secular high-tech businessman , leading in most polls meir porush ultra-orthodox rabbi , israeli mp since 1996 , former deputy housing minister , barkat 's closest challenger arkady gaydamak russian-born tycoon , owner of major israeli football club , currently on trial in absentia in an arms trafficking case in paris dan biron tv executive-turned-bar owner , left-wing candidate from party seeking legalisation of marijuana obstacles to peace : jerusalem diary : mayoral poster wars while many major world cities are swamped with new arrivals , about 5,000 more people leave jerusalem than move in each year .
raffi radovan , 35 , says he and about 10 of his close friends are among those who have left because they say the city is becoming too religious .
he now commutes from tel aviv to his job in an art gallery at the israel museum .
jerusalem 's ultra-orthodox , or haredi , community , with its large families and high birth rate , has grown from about a tenth of the city 's jewish population in the 1960s to between a quarter and a third .
but it is its growing influence in the municipality , and the spread of close-knit communities of black-hatted , strictly-observant haredim into previously secular and mixed neighbourhoods that causes most ire .
i feel less and less that this is my city raffi radovan , secular ex-jerusalemite mr radovan sighs as he talks of the hostile graffiti that appeared on the door of a small artspace he opened and his friend 's problems employing jews in his bar on the sabbath .
" i feel less and less that this is my city , " he says .
haredim are known for moving en-masse into secular or mixed neighbourhoods by paying above market value for apartments , pushing up prices .
with the new residents come fears that , like in long-standing haredi neighbourhoods , women dressed " immodestly " -lrb- which usually means not covered from neck to ankle and wrist , with trousers considered unacceptable -rrb- will be harassed .
they worry too that cars moving on the sabbath will be stoned , and newspapers and non-kosher food will disappear from the shops - which will be forced to close on saturdays .
" i just felt that you ca n't really fight it , " said mr radovan .
" it 's them and us - we are all jewish , but the way we think is different , the way we act , where we shop , it 's a totally different culture . "
the city 's religious make-up is changing the city - both its residents and the municipality - is the poorest in israel , according to israel kimhi of the jerusalem institute for israeli studies .
employment is low among ultra-orthodox men , many of whom study the torah rather than work .
it is also low among women in the roughly one third of the city 's population that is palestinian and israeli-arab .
this means less money flows through taxes into city coffers while , mr kimhi says , a weak private sectors adds to the woes .
spending on education per child is about a third - and the cultural budget less than a tenth - of that in tel aviv , according to figures quoted by mayoral candidates .
many haredis say their needs were previously overlooked " if the existing trends continue , jerusalem is going to decline , " says mr kimhi .
haredi journalist jonathan rosenblum points out that ultra-orthodox jews are strong contributors to state funds through sales taxes on the products they buy for their often large families .
he disagrees with the widespread perception that the outgoing haredi mayor has favoured his own community , arguing that its needs were previously overlooked .
and he points out that high apartment prices and lack of jobs also hit young ultra-orthodox couples , who are leaving the city too .
' hard struggle ' only a couple of kilometres away , with its potholed roads and scruffy buildings , predominantly palestinian east jerusalem is more obviously in decline .
fishmonger and father of six mazen hassounh , 43 , says he has lost of much of the custom he used to get from palestinians in the west bank .
mazen hassounh has considered closing his fish shop the israeli-built west bank barrier , which in places cuts through east jerusalem , has made it much harder for them to visit the city .
and while tourists are slowly returning after the intifada , most stay in west jerusalem , he says .
in some periods he makes a loss .
" it 's a hard struggle .
sometimes i think about closing the shop , " he says .
in comparison , business is booming for his brother-in-law who sells fish in the west bank town of ramallah , the seat of the palestinian authority .
at times mr hassounh contemplates following the many middle class palestinians who have relocated there - especially since , during the intifada , israel put a stop to all official pa activities in east jerusalem .
while ramallah 's restaurants thrive , " here , after 7pm it 's like a ghost city , " he says .
palestinians in east jerusalem suffer continued under-investment and difficulty getting building permits .
they say that from education to refuse collection , their israeli-run municipal services are way below the standard in the west of the city .
but most palestinians in east jerusalem boycott the mayoral elections , seeing participation as legitimising israel 's occupation of the east of the city in the 1967 .
the desire by both israelis and palestinians to have their capital in jerusalem is one of the most explosive issues in peace talks .
but while its residents wait for a compromise to be reached - if it ever is - many on both sides feel they are watching the city drift further from the vibrant , booming capital they want .
