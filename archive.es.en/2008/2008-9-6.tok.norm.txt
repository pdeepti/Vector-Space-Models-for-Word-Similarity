it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .
an artful business bildunterschrift : wine has been produced in the moselle valley since before the romans the change in approach is evident .
producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more : bottles of other grape varieties such as pinot blanc and chardonnay - and even the occasional red wine - are increasingly found on tasting lists around the moselle valley .
but the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with .
" i have to sell my wine twice : first to the customer -lrb- the retailer -rrb- , then to my customer 's customer , " pruem said .
" you have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought . "
like most other wine producers , pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking : " the art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard . "
but he is also introducing a new art - that of public relations .
" my wines need to show character , if they do n't show character then forget it . " - pruem 's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself : if their wine fails to meet standards , then not only is their livelihood , passion and reputation at stake , but also their legacy . antony herrmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .

calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .

his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .

6 , as the deputy of the party chief vojislav seselj , who has been on trial for war crimes at the un international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- since early 2003 , as well as the srs floor leader in the serbian parliament .
srs said in a statement that nikolic stepped down at the party leadership meeting friday night .
the outcome indicates that the extreme hardline wing within srs , loyal to seselj , overcame the moderates led by nikolic .
nikolic has led the srs with apparently comprehensive loyalty since seselj left serbia to face trial in early 2003 - yet under his leadership , the party toned down its belligerent rhetoric , softening its image slightly .
party split over eu ties the srs has won most votes in all parliamentary polls since 2003 , but power always remained elusive , mostly owing to pressure from the eu , which had made it clear that extreme nationalists were not acceptable as partners in serbia 's membership bid .
the power struggle within srs exploded over nikolic 's plan to steer srs to support serbia 's pre-membership treaty with the eu from the opposition .
according to media reports , seselj intervened from his detention in the hague and ordered the party not to back the pro-european cabinet in any way .
the parliament is due to vote on the stabilization and association agreement next week , and it is still not clear how srs representatives in parliament would vote , or if they would actually revert to obstruction by filibustering , causing huge delays in recent months .
the way srs deputies vote may also hint at the future of the party , whether it would shift more to the political centre as nikolic wants , remain on the extreme and destructive right , as seselj wants , or if it will split .
barring more delays , prime minister miroslav cvetkovic 's ruling coalition would have enough support within and outside the complex alliance to push the deal with eu , along with other crucial laws waiting for enactment . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .
but with the eu 's leaders having threatened to postpone talks on a strategic treaty with russia until it pulls out of georgia , they are unlikely to take a soft line .
" they -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not the ones to give people permission to people in the buffer zone .
they have no rights either to give permission or not to give it , " bildt said .

5 .
the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .
osi said it has won cases against 107 individuals who assisted in nazi persecution during world war ii .
another 180 have been blocked from entering the us because of the osi 's watch-list .
one of the most famous ukrainian cases involved john demjanjuk , 88 , the ukrainian-born man alleged to have been a brutal guard at the nazi 's treblinka death camp .
in a case dating back 30 years , demjanjuk has been extradited to israel , acquitted by an israeli court , returned to the us and had his us citizenship revoked .
until recently , no country had offered to take him .
in june , germany 's top holocaust crimes prosecutor kurt schrimm said he would apply to the german high court for demjanjuk 's extradition to be prosecuted under german criminal law .
the court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .

7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .

schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .

the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .

the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .

" the new american administration will , as we all of course also , have to cope with the new emerging countries : apart from russia , which is an old power with a new assertiveness , india , brazil and china , " eu foreign policy commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said friday , sept .
5 .
" we want to be more equal partners with the us , but how can we do that ?
we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .
eu plans cooperation with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner hosted the meeting , as france currently holds the eu presidency " the world is dangerous , the return of nationalism and micro-nationalism impose on -lrb- the eu and us -rrb- a common vision and common steps , " he warned .
" we want to set up a sort of better process , not to be surprised , not to be completely bare-handed , and not always to be obliged to threaten someone else , " he said .
ahead of the us election , scheduled for nov .
4 , the eu is therefore set to draw up a list of the areas in which it would like to work more closely with the us , to be sent to president george w. bush and the two candidates in the election .
" it 's not to take advantage -lrb- of the change of administration -rrb- , but knowing that our american friends ... also wish that the eu should be politically present in the world 's problems , and take its political place , not just as a fund-raiser but a player in its matters of peace , and sometimes of war , " kouchner said .
but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .
looking for answers to climate , energy also at the meeting , ministers discussed with the eu 's top foreign-policy figure , javier solana , how the bloc should update its common security strategy - a document written in december 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier in the day , germany 's foreign minister called for a probe into the russian-georgian war " there are questions like climate change and energy security which need an answer , " solana said , adding that he hoped to present a " short and useful " new document to eu leaders by the end of the year .
tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "
and the rise of russia , china and india has alarmed eu diplomats , with the russian-georgian war and the collapse of wto talks in a row between china , india and the us both seen as signs that western domination of the international agenda can no longer be assured .
" over the last few years , you 've seen a determined effort on the part of europe and the americans to forge common positions on issues as diverse as iran , russia , and international development , " british foreign minister david miliband pointed out .
" there 's still an opportunity to work together , not at the expense of the rising powers in china and india , but as a way of binding them into the global system and making sure that responsibility is shared by all the powers in the modern world , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we should encourage belarus to improve the way they conduct their elections and we should give them incentives .
we need a process of rebuilding trust , " polish foreign minister radek sikorski told dpa news agency from the ministers ' informal meeting in avignon , france , on saturday , sept .
6 .
" it is a very good time to rethink our relations with belarus .
belarus is sending desperate signals to the west , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
officially , saturday 's talks were set to focus on the eu 's relationship with russia and georgia following their war in august .
sarkozy heads to moscow but with french president nicolas sarkozy - the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency - set to travel to moscow for talks on the issue on monday , the officials turned their focus to the question of how to respond to russia 's new assertiveness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski and his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier during their talks , they discussed turkish proposals on maintaining stability in the caucasus and debated how the eu should strengthen international efforts to solve the conflict between moldova and its rebel region of transnistria - a process in which russia is currently pushing for a trilateral solution .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that he had spoken with moldovan president vladimir voronin on thursday , and that voronin stressed that he still saw the peace process as an internationally monitored process .
eu aid for georgia expected after the talks , foreign-affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the eu was likely to offer georgia financial assistance to help overcome the post-war economic crisis , with the total this year possibly reaching 100 million euros -lrb- $ 143 million -rrb- .
" the military destruction is much bigger than the civilian and we think that we have to assess our needs according to that ...
we will have to help , and we will do so , " she said .
and following belarus ' release of its final political prisoners during the summer , some eu ministers called for a strong sign to the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko that minsk has something to gain from bringing in democratic reforms .
belarus " is not a regime that we admire but we should recognize what has been done .
we now have an anomaly , we 've dropped sanctions on cuba where there are 260 political prisoners , belarus has released its prisoners , " sikorski said .
eu mulls lifting restrictions on belarus the eu currently has travel bans in place against belarusian regime figures , and its first step should therefore be to step up diplomatic contacts , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski said the eu does n't admire lukashenko 's regime ministers have decided in principle to invite belarusian foreign minister sergei martynov to talks in brussels , although it is not yet sure whether they will do so ahead of the next formal ministerial session on sept .
15 , kouchner told dpa .
however , member states remained divided on whether they should make a move before belarus holds elections on sept .
28 .
" it would be good to send some signals now , and in case of democratic free and fair elections to change -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- general policies , " vaitiekunas said .
" we 'll have to have a look at that at a later stage , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
eu officials say that a key question is whether belarus will follow russia 's lead and recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - something the eu firmly rejects .
" belarus can show real willingness to open up , move closer to western europe if they do not also recognize south ossetia and abkhazia .
but of course belarus at the moment is under very heavy pressure from russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .

in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .
although he insists that the film is really about love , dresen admits his intention to break a taboo with wolke 9 and show his audience that seniors are sexual beings too .
just a love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge has to choose between two lovers " of course it was important to me to show that old people do n't just go on bus tours and boat cruises and buy warm blankets , " he told die tageszeitung .
with inge 's cavorting between - or on top of the sheets , dresen indeed offers a different glimpse into old age .
his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .
" love can sneak up on you at any point , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 06.09.2008 serbian ultra-nationalists split , top leader resigns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic had led the moderate wing of the ultra-nationalist srs rumors that the powerful ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- was splitting were confirmed when its acting leader , tomislav nikolic , resigned all his party posts . nikolic resigned saturday , sept .
6 , as the deputy of the party chief vojislav seselj , who has been on trial for war crimes at the un international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- since early 2003 , as well as the srs floor leader in the serbian parliament .
srs said in a statement that nikolic stepped down at the party leadership meeting friday night .
the outcome indicates that the extreme hardline wing within srs , loyal to seselj , overcame the moderates led by nikolic .
nikolic has led the srs with apparently comprehensive loyalty since seselj left serbia to face trial in early 2003 - yet under his leadership , the party toned down its belligerent rhetoric , softening its image slightly .
party split over eu ties the srs has won most votes in all parliamentary polls since 2003 , but power always remained elusive , mostly owing to pressure from the eu , which had made it clear that extreme nationalists were not acceptable as partners in serbia 's membership bid .
the power struggle within srs exploded over nikolic 's plan to steer srs to support serbia 's pre-membership treaty with the eu from the opposition .
according to media reports , seselj intervened from his detention in the hague and ordered the party not to back the pro-european cabinet in any way .
the parliament is due to vote on the stabilization and association agreement next week , and it is still not clear how srs representatives in parliament would vote , or if they would actually revert to obstruction by filibustering , causing huge delays in recent months .
the way srs deputies vote may also hint at the future of the party , whether it would shift more to the political centre as nikolic wants , remain on the extreme and destructive right , as seselj wants , or if it will split .
barring more delays , prime minister miroslav cvetkovic 's ruling coalition would have enough support within and outside the complex alliance to push the deal with eu , along with other crucial laws waiting for enactment . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .

it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .

the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 06.09.2008 eu to double number of informal foreign ministers ' meetings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most recent meeting of eu foreign ministers was held in avignon european union foreign ministers should hold four informal meetings per year instead of two , the ministers agreed at such a meeting in the sun-drenched mediaeval french town of avignon . " we have decided that there will be two -lrb- informal meetings -rrb- per presidency and per half year , and the next one will be held in paris , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the talks in the french town of avignon , said on friday , sept .
5 .
the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .
ever since 1974 , foreign ministers have held one informal meeting per presidency , on top of the usual half-dozen formal sessions that they hold .
the series is named " gymnich , " after the german castle where the first one was convened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first meeting was held in gymnich castle near the former german capital of bonn kouchner said that the second gymnich of the french presidency will be held in paris , and hinted that it would take place before the us election on nov .
4 .
the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .
however , the decision could well prove to be a headache for future presidencies , who will now have to fit an extra meeting of 27 foreign ministers in among the dozen informal meetings , two summits and several dozen formal ministerial sessions that they already have to hold in a six-month period . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .
but with the eu 's leaders having threatened to postpone talks on a strategic treaty with russia until it pulls out of georgia , they are unlikely to take a soft line .
" they -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not the ones to give people permission to people in the buffer zone .
they have no rights either to give permission or not to give it , " bildt said .

5 .
the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .
osi said it has won cases against 107 individuals who assisted in nazi persecution during world war ii .
another 180 have been blocked from entering the us because of the osi 's watch-list .
one of the most famous ukrainian cases involved john demjanjuk , 88 , the ukrainian-born man alleged to have been a brutal guard at the nazi 's treblinka death camp .
in a case dating back 30 years , demjanjuk has been extradited to israel , acquitted by an israeli court , returned to the us and had his us citizenship revoked .
until recently , no country had offered to take him .
in june , germany 's top holocaust crimes prosecutor kurt schrimm said he would apply to the german high court for demjanjuk 's extradition to be prosecuted under german criminal law .
the court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 06.09.2008 eu set to approve observer mission to georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has called on russia to pull its troops out of the buffer zones the european union is set to give the go-ahead to a team of ceasefire observers for georgia at a formal meeting of foreign ministers on sept .
15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .

ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .

it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .
an artful business bildunterschrift : wine has been produced in the moselle valley since before the romans the change in approach is evident .
producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more : bottles of other grape varieties such as pinot blanc and chardonnay - and even the occasional red wine - are increasingly found on tasting lists around the moselle valley .
but the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with .
" i have to sell my wine twice : first to the customer -lrb- the retailer -rrb- , then to my customer 's customer , " pruem said .
" you have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought . "
like most other wine producers , pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking : " the art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard . "
but he is also introducing a new art - that of public relations .
" my wines need to show character , if they do n't show character then forget it . " - pruem 's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself : if their wine fails to meet standards , then not only is their livelihood , passion and reputation at stake , but also their legacy . antony herrmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.09.2008 opinion : german social democrats need to battle it out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's social democrats are to hold a meeting on sunday , sept .
7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .
in these states , the spd is almost guaranteed to limp in third place behind the left party .
the spd 's situation might have reached boiling point , but , in fact , the party 's crisis is a long-term one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle party chairman kurt beck , currently in an uncomfortable position between a rock and a hard place , is the party 's third leader since gerhard schroeder stepped down in 2004 in a bid to salvage the chancellorship .
schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .
but it is all the spd can do right now if it is to find its way ahead of the bundestag elections .
if it results in a clear goal , shared by the party , then it is a good thing .

" we have decided that there will be two -lrb- informal meetings -rrb- per presidency and per half year , and the next one will be held in paris , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the talks in the french town of avignon , said on friday , sept .
5 .
the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .
ever since 1974 , foreign ministers have held one informal meeting per presidency , on top of the usual half-dozen formal sessions that they hold .
the series is named " gymnich , " after the german castle where the first one was convened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first meeting was held in gymnich castle near the former german capital of bonn kouchner said that the second gymnich of the french presidency will be held in paris , and hinted that it would take place before the us election on nov .
4 .
the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .
however , the decision could well prove to be a headache for future presidencies , who will now have to fit an extra meeting of 27 foreign ministers in among the dozen informal meetings , two summits and several dozen formal ministerial sessions that they already have to hold in a six-month period . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

srs said in a statement that nikolic stepped down at the party leadership meeting friday night .
the outcome indicates that the extreme hardline wing within srs , loyal to seselj , overcame the moderates led by nikolic .
nikolic has led the srs with apparently comprehensive loyalty since seselj left serbia to face trial in early 2003 - yet under his leadership , the party toned down its belligerent rhetoric , softening its image slightly .
party split over eu ties the srs has won most votes in all parliamentary polls since 2003 , but power always remained elusive , mostly owing to pressure from the eu , which had made it clear that extreme nationalists were not acceptable as partners in serbia 's membership bid .
the power struggle within srs exploded over nikolic 's plan to steer srs to support serbia 's pre-membership treaty with the eu from the opposition .
according to media reports , seselj intervened from his detention in the hague and ordered the party not to back the pro-european cabinet in any way .
the parliament is due to vote on the stabilization and association agreement next week , and it is still not clear how srs representatives in parliament would vote , or if they would actually revert to obstruction by filibustering , causing huge delays in recent months .
the way srs deputies vote may also hint at the future of the party , whether it would shift more to the political centre as nikolic wants , remain on the extreme and destructive right , as seselj wants , or if it will split .

5 .
the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .
osi said it has won cases against 107 individuals who assisted in nazi persecution during world war ii .
another 180 have been blocked from entering the us because of the osi 's watch-list .
one of the most famous ukrainian cases involved john demjanjuk , 88 , the ukrainian-born man alleged to have been a brutal guard at the nazi 's treblinka death camp .
in a case dating back 30 years , demjanjuk has been extradited to israel , acquitted by an israeli court , returned to the us and had his us citizenship revoked .
until recently , no country had offered to take him .
in june , germany 's top holocaust crimes prosecutor kurt schrimm said he would apply to the german high court for demjanjuk 's extradition to be prosecuted under german criminal law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 06.09.2008 eu set to approve observer mission to georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has called on russia to pull its troops out of the buffer zones the european union is set to give the go-ahead to a team of ceasefire observers for georgia at a formal meeting of foreign ministers on sept .
15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .
but with the eu 's leaders having threatened to postpone talks on a strategic treaty with russia until it pulls out of georgia , they are unlikely to take a soft line .
" they -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not the ones to give people permission to people in the buffer zone .
they have no rights either to give permission or not to give it , " bildt said .
" we will deploy our mission to georgia without asking russia for permission , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .

15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .
but with the eu 's leaders having threatened to postpone talks on a strategic treaty with russia until it pulls out of georgia , they are unlikely to take a soft line .
" they -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not the ones to give people permission to people in the buffer zone .
they have no rights either to give permission or not to give it , " bildt said .

" we should encourage belarus to improve the way they conduct their elections and we should give them incentives .
we need a process of rebuilding trust , " polish foreign minister radek sikorski told dpa news agency from the ministers ' informal meeting in avignon , france , on saturday , sept .
6 .
" it is a very good time to rethink our relations with belarus .
belarus is sending desperate signals to the west , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
officially , saturday 's talks were set to focus on the eu 's relationship with russia and georgia following their war in august .
sarkozy heads to moscow but with french president nicolas sarkozy - the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency - set to travel to moscow for talks on the issue on monday , the officials turned their focus to the question of how to respond to russia 's new assertiveness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski and his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier during their talks , they discussed turkish proposals on maintaining stability in the caucasus and debated how the eu should strengthen international efforts to solve the conflict between moldova and its rebel region of transnistria - a process in which russia is currently pushing for a trilateral solution .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that he had spoken with moldovan president vladimir voronin on thursday , and that voronin stressed that he still saw the peace process as an internationally monitored process .
eu aid for georgia expected after the talks , foreign-affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the eu was likely to offer georgia financial assistance to help overcome the post-war economic crisis , with the total this year possibly reaching 100 million euros -lrb- $ 143 million -rrb- .
" the military destruction is much bigger than the civilian and we think that we have to assess our needs according to that ...
we will have to help , and we will do so , " she said .
and following belarus ' release of its final political prisoners during the summer , some eu ministers called for a strong sign to the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko that minsk has something to gain from bringing in democratic reforms .
belarus " is not a regime that we admire but we should recognize what has been done .
we now have an anomaly , we 've dropped sanctions on cuba where there are 260 political prisoners , belarus has released its prisoners , " sikorski said .
eu mulls lifting restrictions on belarus the eu currently has travel bans in place against belarusian regime figures , and its first step should therefore be to step up diplomatic contacts , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski said the eu does n't admire lukashenko 's regime ministers have decided in principle to invite belarusian foreign minister sergei martynov to talks in brussels , although it is not yet sure whether they will do so ahead of the next formal ministerial session on sept .
15 , kouchner told dpa .
however , member states remained divided on whether they should make a move before belarus holds elections on sept .
28 .
" it would be good to send some signals now , and in case of democratic free and fair elections to change -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- general policies , " vaitiekunas said .
" we 'll have to have a look at that at a later stage , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
eu officials say that a key question is whether belarus will follow russia 's lead and recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - something the eu firmly rejects .
" belarus can show real willingness to open up , move closer to western europe if they do not also recognize south ossetia and abkhazia .
but of course belarus at the moment is under very heavy pressure from russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .
although he insists that the film is really about love , dresen admits his intention to break a taboo with wolke 9 and show his audience that seniors are sexual beings too .
just a love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge has to choose between two lovers " of course it was important to me to show that old people do n't just go on bus tours and boat cruises and buy warm blankets , " he told die tageszeitung .
with inge 's cavorting between - or on top of the sheets , dresen indeed offers a different glimpse into old age .
his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 06.09.2008 german wine producers discover the art of pr großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost all wine grapes in the moselle area are hand picked after years of being thought of as cheap and sugary , german wine is enjoying huge international success .
it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .
an artful business bildunterschrift : wine has been produced in the moselle valley since before the romans the change in approach is evident .
producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more : bottles of other grape varieties such as pinot blanc and chardonnay - and even the occasional red wine - are increasingly found on tasting lists around the moselle valley .
but the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with .
" i have to sell my wine twice : first to the customer -lrb- the retailer -rrb- , then to my customer 's customer , " pruem said .
" you have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought . "
like most other wine producers , pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking : " the art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard . "
but he is also introducing a new art - that of public relations .
" my wines need to show character , if they do n't show character then forget it . " - pruem 's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself : if their wine fails to meet standards , then not only is their livelihood , passion and reputation at stake , but also their legacy . antony herrmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .
although he insists that the film is really about love , dresen admits his intention to break a taboo with wolke 9 and show his audience that seniors are sexual beings too .

his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.09.2008 opinion : german social democrats need to battle it out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's social democrats are to hold a meeting on sunday , sept .
7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .
in these states , the spd is almost guaranteed to limp in third place behind the left party .
the spd 's situation might have reached boiling point , but , in fact , the party 's crisis is a long-term one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle party chairman kurt beck , currently in an uncomfortable position between a rock and a hard place , is the party 's third leader since gerhard schroeder stepped down in 2004 in a bid to salvage the chancellorship .
schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .
but it is all the spd can do right now if it is to find its way ahead of the bundestag elections .
if it results in a clear goal , shared by the party , then it is a good thing .

-lrb- 02.09.2008 -rrb- germany 's left party breathing down spd 's neck in new poll the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are facing a growing challenge from die linke , a rival left-wing party , making it even more difficult to predict who will govern germany after the 2009 general election .

the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .

" the new american administration will , as we all of course also , have to cope with the new emerging countries : apart from russia , which is an old power with a new assertiveness , india , brazil and china , " eu foreign policy commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said friday , sept .
5 .
" we want to be more equal partners with the us , but how can we do that ?
we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .
eu plans cooperation with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner hosted the meeting , as france currently holds the eu presidency " the world is dangerous , the return of nationalism and micro-nationalism impose on -lrb- the eu and us -rrb- a common vision and common steps , " he warned .
" we want to set up a sort of better process , not to be surprised , not to be completely bare-handed , and not always to be obliged to threaten someone else , " he said .
ahead of the us election , scheduled for nov .
4 , the eu is therefore set to draw up a list of the areas in which it would like to work more closely with the us , to be sent to president george w. bush and the two candidates in the election .
" it 's not to take advantage -lrb- of the change of administration -rrb- , but knowing that our american friends ... also wish that the eu should be politically present in the world 's problems , and take its political place , not just as a fund-raiser but a player in its matters of peace , and sometimes of war , " kouchner said .
but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .
looking for answers to climate , energy also at the meeting , ministers discussed with the eu 's top foreign-policy figure , javier solana , how the bloc should update its common security strategy - a document written in december 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier in the day , germany 's foreign minister called for a probe into the russian-georgian war " there are questions like climate change and energy security which need an answer , " solana said , adding that he hoped to present a " short and useful " new document to eu leaders by the end of the year .
tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "

" the new american administration will , as we all of course also , have to cope with the new emerging countries : apart from russia , which is an old power with a new assertiveness , india , brazil and china , " eu foreign policy commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said friday , sept .
5 .
" we want to be more equal partners with the us , but how can we do that ?
we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .
eu plans cooperation with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner hosted the meeting , as france currently holds the eu presidency " the world is dangerous , the return of nationalism and micro-nationalism impose on -lrb- the eu and us -rrb- a common vision and common steps , " he warned .
" we want to set up a sort of better process , not to be surprised , not to be completely bare-handed , and not always to be obliged to threaten someone else , " he said .
ahead of the us election , scheduled for nov .
4 , the eu is therefore set to draw up a list of the areas in which it would like to work more closely with the us , to be sent to president george w. bush and the two candidates in the election .
" it 's not to take advantage -lrb- of the change of administration -rrb- , but knowing that our american friends ... also wish that the eu should be politically present in the world 's problems , and take its political place , not just as a fund-raiser but a player in its matters of peace , and sometimes of war , " kouchner said .
but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .
looking for answers to climate , energy also at the meeting , ministers discussed with the eu 's top foreign-policy figure , javier solana , how the bloc should update its common security strategy - a document written in december 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier in the day , germany 's foreign minister called for a probe into the russian-georgian war " there are questions like climate change and energy security which need an answer , " solana said , adding that he hoped to present a " short and useful " new document to eu leaders by the end of the year .
tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "

in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .
although he insists that the film is really about love , dresen admits his intention to break a taboo with wolke 9 and show his audience that seniors are sexual beings too .
just a love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge has to choose between two lovers " of course it was important to me to show that old people do n't just go on bus tours and boat cruises and buy warm blankets , " he told die tageszeitung .
with inge 's cavorting between - or on top of the sheets , dresen indeed offers a different glimpse into old age .
his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .
" love can sneak up on you at any point , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .
osi said it has won cases against 107 individuals who assisted in nazi persecution during world war ii .
another 180 have been blocked from entering the us because of the osi 's watch-list .
one of the most famous ukrainian cases involved john demjanjuk , 88 , the ukrainian-born man alleged to have been a brutal guard at the nazi 's treblinka death camp .
in a case dating back 30 years , demjanjuk has been extradited to israel , acquitted by an israeli court , returned to the us and had his us citizenship revoked .
until recently , no country had offered to take him .
in june , germany 's top holocaust crimes prosecutor kurt schrimm said he would apply to the german high court for demjanjuk 's extradition to be prosecuted under german criminal law .
the court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 06.09.2008 german wine producers discover the art of pr großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost all wine grapes in the moselle area are hand picked after years of being thought of as cheap and sugary , german wine is enjoying huge international success .
it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .
an artful business bildunterschrift : wine has been produced in the moselle valley since before the romans the change in approach is evident .
producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more : bottles of other grape varieties such as pinot blanc and chardonnay - and even the occasional red wine - are increasingly found on tasting lists around the moselle valley .
but the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with .
" i have to sell my wine twice : first to the customer -lrb- the retailer -rrb- , then to my customer 's customer , " pruem said .
" you have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought . "
like most other wine producers , pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking : " the art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard . "
but he is also introducing a new art - that of public relations .
" my wines need to show character , if they do n't show character then forget it . " - pruem 's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself : if their wine fails to meet standards , then not only is their livelihood , passion and reputation at stake , but also their legacy . antony herrmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .
looking for answers to climate , energy also at the meeting , ministers discussed with the eu 's top foreign-policy figure , javier solana , how the bloc should update its common security strategy - a document written in december 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier in the day , germany 's foreign minister called for a probe into the russian-georgian war " there are questions like climate change and energy security which need an answer , " solana said , adding that he hoped to present a " short and useful " new document to eu leaders by the end of the year .
tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "
and the rise of russia , china and india has alarmed eu diplomats , with the russian-georgian war and the collapse of wto talks in a row between china , india and the us both seen as signs that western domination of the international agenda can no longer be assured .
" over the last few years , you 've seen a determined effort on the part of europe and the americans to forge common positions on issues as diverse as iran , russia , and international development , " british foreign minister david miliband pointed out .
" there 's still an opportunity to work together , not at the expense of the rising powers in china and india , but as a way of binding them into the global system and making sure that responsibility is shared by all the powers in the modern world , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .
an artful business bildunterschrift : wine has been produced in the moselle valley since before the romans the change in approach is evident .
producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more : bottles of other grape varieties such as pinot blanc and chardonnay - and even the occasional red wine - are increasingly found on tasting lists around the moselle valley .
but the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with .
" i have to sell my wine twice : first to the customer -lrb- the retailer -rrb- , then to my customer 's customer , " pruem said .
" you have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought . "
like most other wine producers , pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking : " the art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard . "
but he is also introducing a new art - that of public relations .
" my wines need to show character , if they do n't show character then forget it . " - pruem 's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself : if their wine fails to meet standards , then not only is their livelihood , passion and reputation at stake , but also their legacy . antony herrmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .
in these states , the spd is almost guaranteed to limp in third place behind the left party .
the spd 's situation might have reached boiling point , but , in fact , the party 's crisis is a long-term one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle party chairman kurt beck , currently in an uncomfortable position between a rock and a hard place , is the party 's third leader since gerhard schroeder stepped down in 2004 in a bid to salvage the chancellorship .
schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .
but it is all the spd can do right now if it is to find its way ahead of the bundestag elections .
if it results in a clear goal , shared by the party , then it is a good thing .

7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .
in these states , the spd is almost guaranteed to limp in third place behind the left party .
the spd 's situation might have reached boiling point , but , in fact , the party 's crisis is a long-term one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle party chairman kurt beck , currently in an uncomfortable position between a rock and a hard place , is the party 's third leader since gerhard schroeder stepped down in 2004 in a bid to salvage the chancellorship .
schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .
but it is all the spd can do right now if it is to find its way ahead of the bundestag elections .
if it results in a clear goal , shared by the party , then it is a good thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 06.09.2008 new german film breaks senior sex taboo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things get better with age ...
in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .
although he insists that the film is really about love , dresen admits his intention to break a taboo with wolke 9 and show his audience that seniors are sexual beings too .
just a love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge has to choose between two lovers " of course it was important to me to show that old people do n't just go on bus tours and boat cruises and buy warm blankets , " he told die tageszeitung .
with inge 's cavorting between - or on top of the sheets , dresen indeed offers a different glimpse into old age .
his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .

7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .

schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .

it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .
an artful business bildunterschrift : wine has been produced in the moselle valley since before the romans the change in approach is evident .
producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more : bottles of other grape varieties such as pinot blanc and chardonnay - and even the occasional red wine - are increasingly found on tasting lists around the moselle valley .
but the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with .
" i have to sell my wine twice : first to the customer -lrb- the retailer -rrb- , then to my customer 's customer , " pruem said .
" you have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought . "
like most other wine producers , pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking : " the art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard . "
but he is also introducing a new art - that of public relations .
" my wines need to show character , if they do n't show character then forget it . " - pruem 's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself : if their wine fails to meet standards , then not only is their livelihood , passion and reputation at stake , but also their legacy . antony herrmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have decided that there will be two -lrb- informal meetings -rrb- per presidency and per half year , and the next one will be held in paris , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the talks in the french town of avignon , said on friday , sept .
5 .
the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .
ever since 1974 , foreign ministers have held one informal meeting per presidency , on top of the usual half-dozen formal sessions that they hold .
the series is named " gymnich , " after the german castle where the first one was convened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first meeting was held in gymnich castle near the former german capital of bonn kouchner said that the second gymnich of the french presidency will be held in paris , and hinted that it would take place before the us election on nov .
4 .
the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .
however , the decision could well prove to be a headache for future presidencies , who will now have to fit an extra meeting of 27 foreign ministers in among the dozen informal meetings , two summits and several dozen formal ministerial sessions that they already have to hold in a six-month period . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .
osi said it has won cases against 107 individuals who assisted in nazi persecution during world war ii .
another 180 have been blocked from entering the us because of the osi 's watch-list .
one of the most famous ukrainian cases involved john demjanjuk , 88 , the ukrainian-born man alleged to have been a brutal guard at the nazi 's treblinka death camp .
in a case dating back 30 years , demjanjuk has been extradited to israel , acquitted by an israeli court , returned to the us and had his us citizenship revoked .
until recently , no country had offered to take him .
in june , germany 's top holocaust crimes prosecutor kurt schrimm said he would apply to the german high court for demjanjuk 's extradition to be prosecuted under german criminal law .
the court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .

in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .
although he insists that the film is really about love , dresen admits his intention to break a taboo with wolke 9 and show his audience that seniors are sexual beings too .

with inge 's cavorting between - or on top of the sheets , dresen indeed offers a different glimpse into old age .
his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .

15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .
but with the eu 's leaders having threatened to postpone talks on a strategic treaty with russia until it pulls out of georgia , they are unlikely to take a soft line .
" they -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not the ones to give people permission to people in the buffer zone .
they have no rights either to give permission or not to give it , " bildt said .

russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .

" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however .

" we have decided that there will be two -lrb- informal meetings -rrb- per presidency and per half year , and the next one will be held in paris , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the talks in the french town of avignon , said on friday , sept .
5 .
the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .
ever since 1974 , foreign ministers have held one informal meeting per presidency , on top of the usual half-dozen formal sessions that they hold .
the series is named " gymnich , " after the german castle where the first one was convened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first meeting was held in gymnich castle near the former german capital of bonn kouchner said that the second gymnich of the french presidency will be held in paris , and hinted that it would take place before the us election on nov .
4 .
the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .
however , the decision could well prove to be a headache for future presidencies , who will now have to fit an extra meeting of 27 foreign ministers in among the dozen informal meetings , two summits and several dozen formal ministerial sessions that they already have to hold in a six-month period . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .
although he insists that the film is really about love , dresen admits his intention to break a taboo with wolke 9 and show his audience that seniors are sexual beings too .
just a love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge has to choose between two lovers " of course it was important to me to show that old people do n't just go on bus tours and boat cruises and buy warm blankets , " he told die tageszeitung .
with inge 's cavorting between - or on top of the sheets , dresen indeed offers a different glimpse into old age .
his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .
" love can sneak up on you at any point , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have decided that there will be two -lrb- informal meetings -rrb- per presidency and per half year , and the next one will be held in paris , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the talks in the french town of avignon , said on friday , sept .
5 .
the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .
ever since 1974 , foreign ministers have held one informal meeting per presidency , on top of the usual half-dozen formal sessions that they hold .
the series is named " gymnich , " after the german castle where the first one was convened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first meeting was held in gymnich castle near the former german capital of bonn kouchner said that the second gymnich of the french presidency will be held in paris , and hinted that it would take place before the us election on nov .
4 .
the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .
however , the decision could well prove to be a headache for future presidencies , who will now have to fit an extra meeting of 27 foreign ministers in among the dozen informal meetings , two summits and several dozen formal ministerial sessions that they already have to hold in a six-month period . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .

the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .

7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .
in these states , the spd is almost guaranteed to limp in third place behind the left party .
the spd 's situation might have reached boiling point , but , in fact , the party 's crisis is a long-term one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle party chairman kurt beck , currently in an uncomfortable position between a rock and a hard place , is the party 's third leader since gerhard schroeder stepped down in 2004 in a bid to salvage the chancellorship .
schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .
but it is all the spd can do right now if it is to find its way ahead of the bundestag elections .
if it results in a clear goal , shared by the party , then it is a good thing .

" the new american administration will , as we all of course also , have to cope with the new emerging countries : apart from russia , which is an old power with a new assertiveness , india , brazil and china , " eu foreign policy commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said friday , sept .
5 .
" we want to be more equal partners with the us , but how can we do that ?
we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .
eu plans cooperation with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner hosted the meeting , as france currently holds the eu presidency " the world is dangerous , the return of nationalism and micro-nationalism impose on -lrb- the eu and us -rrb- a common vision and common steps , " he warned .
" we want to set up a sort of better process , not to be surprised , not to be completely bare-handed , and not always to be obliged to threaten someone else , " he said .
ahead of the us election , scheduled for nov .
4 , the eu is therefore set to draw up a list of the areas in which it would like to work more closely with the us , to be sent to president george w. bush and the two candidates in the election .
" it 's not to take advantage -lrb- of the change of administration -rrb- , but knowing that our american friends ... also wish that the eu should be politically present in the world 's problems , and take its political place , not just as a fund-raiser but a player in its matters of peace , and sometimes of war , " kouchner said .
but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .
looking for answers to climate , energy also at the meeting , ministers discussed with the eu 's top foreign-policy figure , javier solana , how the bloc should update its common security strategy - a document written in december 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier in the day , germany 's foreign minister called for a probe into the russian-georgian war " there are questions like climate change and energy security which need an answer , " solana said , adding that he hoped to present a " short and useful " new document to eu leaders by the end of the year .
tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "
and the rise of russia , china and india has alarmed eu diplomats , with the russian-georgian war and the collapse of wto talks in a row between china , india and the us both seen as signs that western domination of the international agenda can no longer be assured .
" over the last few years , you 've seen a determined effort on the part of europe and the americans to forge common positions on issues as diverse as iran , russia , and international development , " british foreign minister david miliband pointed out .
" there 's still an opportunity to work together , not at the expense of the rising powers in china and india , but as a way of binding them into the global system and making sure that responsibility is shared by all the powers in the modern world , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the new american administration will , as we all of course also , have to cope with the new emerging countries : apart from russia , which is an old power with a new assertiveness , india , brazil and china , " eu foreign policy commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said friday , sept .

" we want to be more equal partners with the us , but how can we do that ?
we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .
eu plans cooperation with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner hosted the meeting , as france currently holds the eu presidency " the world is dangerous , the return of nationalism and micro-nationalism impose on -lrb- the eu and us -rrb- a common vision and common steps , " he warned .
" we want to set up a sort of better process , not to be surprised , not to be completely bare-handed , and not always to be obliged to threaten someone else , " he said .

" it 's not to take advantage -lrb- of the change of administration -rrb- , but knowing that our american friends ... also wish that the eu should be politically present in the world 's problems , and take its political place , not just as a fund-raiser but a player in its matters of peace , and sometimes of war , " kouchner said .
but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .

tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "

" over the last few years , you 've seen a determined effort on the part of europe and the americans to forge common positions on issues as diverse as iran , russia , and international development , " british foreign minister david miliband pointed out .
" there 's still an opportunity to work together , not at the expense of the rising powers in china and india , but as a way of binding them into the global system and making sure that responsibility is shared by all the powers in the modern world , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .
eu plans cooperation with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner hosted the meeting , as france currently holds the eu presidency " the world is dangerous , the return of nationalism and micro-nationalism impose on -lrb- the eu and us -rrb- a common vision and common steps , " he warned .
" we want to set up a sort of better process , not to be surprised , not to be completely bare-handed , and not always to be obliged to threaten someone else , " he said .
ahead of the us election , scheduled for nov .
4 , the eu is therefore set to draw up a list of the areas in which it would like to work more closely with the us , to be sent to president george w. bush and the two candidates in the election .
" it 's not to take advantage -lrb- of the change of administration -rrb- , but knowing that our american friends ... also wish that the eu should be politically present in the world 's problems , and take its political place , not just as a fund-raiser but a player in its matters of peace , and sometimes of war , " kouchner said .
but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .
looking for answers to climate , energy also at the meeting , ministers discussed with the eu 's top foreign-policy figure , javier solana , how the bloc should update its common security strategy - a document written in december 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier in the day , germany 's foreign minister called for a probe into the russian-georgian war " there are questions like climate change and energy security which need an answer , " solana said , adding that he hoped to present a " short and useful " new document to eu leaders by the end of the year .
tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "
and the rise of russia , china and india has alarmed eu diplomats , with the russian-georgian war and the collapse of wto talks in a row between china , india and the us both seen as signs that western domination of the international agenda can no longer be assured .
" over the last few years , you 've seen a determined effort on the part of europe and the americans to forge common positions on issues as diverse as iran , russia , and international development , " british foreign minister david miliband pointed out .
" there 's still an opportunity to work together , not at the expense of the rising powers in china and india , but as a way of binding them into the global system and making sure that responsibility is shared by all the powers in the modern world , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .
in these states , the spd is almost guaranteed to limp in third place behind the left party .
the spd 's situation might have reached boiling point , but , in fact , the party 's crisis is a long-term one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle party chairman kurt beck , currently in an uncomfortable position between a rock and a hard place , is the party 's third leader since gerhard schroeder stepped down in 2004 in a bid to salvage the chancellorship .
schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .
but it is all the spd can do right now if it is to find its way ahead of the bundestag elections .
if it results in a clear goal , shared by the party , then it is a good thing .

srs said in a statement that nikolic stepped down at the party leadership meeting friday night .

the parliament is due to vote on the stabilization and association agreement next week , and it is still not clear how srs representatives in parliament would vote , or if they would actually revert to obstruction by filibustering , causing huge delays in recent months .

it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .
an artful business bildunterschrift : wine has been produced in the moselle valley since before the romans the change in approach is evident .
producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more : bottles of other grape varieties such as pinot blanc and chardonnay - and even the occasional red wine - are increasingly found on tasting lists around the moselle valley .
but the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with .
" i have to sell my wine twice : first to the customer -lrb- the retailer -rrb- , then to my customer 's customer , " pruem said .
" you have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought . "
like most other wine producers , pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking : " the art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard . "
but he is also introducing a new art - that of public relations .
" my wines need to show character , if they do n't show character then forget it . " - pruem 's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself : if their wine fails to meet standards , then not only is their livelihood , passion and reputation at stake , but also their legacy . antony herrmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .

it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .

5 .
the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .
osi said it has won cases against 107 individuals who assisted in nazi persecution during world war ii .

until recently , no country had offered to take him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 06.09.2008 eu looks for ties in russia 's backyard after georgia war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recognizing georgia 's rebel provinces would push belarus away from the eu the eu must open the door to a rapprochement with belarus and support reconstruction and peace in georgia and moldova if it is to counter russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe , eu foreign ministers said . " we should encourage belarus to improve the way they conduct their elections and we should give them incentives .
we need a process of rebuilding trust , " polish foreign minister radek sikorski told dpa news agency from the ministers ' informal meeting in avignon , france , on saturday , sept .
6 .
" it is a very good time to rethink our relations with belarus .
belarus is sending desperate signals to the west , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
officially , saturday 's talks were set to focus on the eu 's relationship with russia and georgia following their war in august .
sarkozy heads to moscow but with french president nicolas sarkozy - the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency - set to travel to moscow for talks on the issue on monday , the officials turned their focus to the question of how to respond to russia 's new assertiveness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski and his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier during their talks , they discussed turkish proposals on maintaining stability in the caucasus and debated how the eu should strengthen international efforts to solve the conflict between moldova and its rebel region of transnistria - a process in which russia is currently pushing for a trilateral solution .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that he had spoken with moldovan president vladimir voronin on thursday , and that voronin stressed that he still saw the peace process as an internationally monitored process .
eu aid for georgia expected after the talks , foreign-affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the eu was likely to offer georgia financial assistance to help overcome the post-war economic crisis , with the total this year possibly reaching 100 million euros -lrb- $ 143 million -rrb- .
" the military destruction is much bigger than the civilian and we think that we have to assess our needs according to that ...
we will have to help , and we will do so , " she said .
and following belarus ' release of its final political prisoners during the summer , some eu ministers called for a strong sign to the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko that minsk has something to gain from bringing in democratic reforms .
belarus " is not a regime that we admire but we should recognize what has been done .
we now have an anomaly , we 've dropped sanctions on cuba where there are 260 political prisoners , belarus has released its prisoners , " sikorski said .
eu mulls lifting restrictions on belarus the eu currently has travel bans in place against belarusian regime figures , and its first step should therefore be to step up diplomatic contacts , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski said the eu does n't admire lukashenko 's regime ministers have decided in principle to invite belarusian foreign minister sergei martynov to talks in brussels , although it is not yet sure whether they will do so ahead of the next formal ministerial session on sept .
15 , kouchner told dpa .
however , member states remained divided on whether they should make a move before belarus holds elections on sept .
28 .
" it would be good to send some signals now , and in case of democratic free and fair elections to change -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- general policies , " vaitiekunas said .
" we 'll have to have a look at that at a later stage , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
eu officials say that a key question is whether belarus will follow russia 's lead and recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - something the eu firmly rejects .
" belarus can show real willingness to open up , move closer to western europe if they do not also recognize south ossetia and abkhazia .
but of course belarus at the moment is under very heavy pressure from russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we should encourage belarus to improve the way they conduct their elections and we should give them incentives .
we need a process of rebuilding trust , " polish foreign minister radek sikorski told dpa news agency from the ministers ' informal meeting in avignon , france , on saturday , sept .

" it is a very good time to rethink our relations with belarus .
belarus is sending desperate signals to the west , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
officially , saturday 's talks were set to focus on the eu 's relationship with russia and georgia following their war in august .
sarkozy heads to moscow but with french president nicolas sarkozy - the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency - set to travel to moscow for talks on the issue on monday , the officials turned their focus to the question of how to respond to russia 's new assertiveness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski and his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier during their talks , they discussed turkish proposals on maintaining stability in the caucasus and debated how the eu should strengthen international efforts to solve the conflict between moldova and its rebel region of transnistria - a process in which russia is currently pushing for a trilateral solution .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that he had spoken with moldovan president vladimir voronin on thursday , and that voronin stressed that he still saw the peace process as an internationally monitored process .
eu aid for georgia expected after the talks , foreign-affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the eu was likely to offer georgia financial assistance to help overcome the post-war economic crisis , with the total this year possibly reaching 100 million euros -lrb- $ 143 million -rrb- .
" the military destruction is much bigger than the civilian and we think that we have to assess our needs according to that ...

belarus " is not a regime that we admire but we should recognize what has been done .
we now have an anomaly , we 've dropped sanctions on cuba where there are 260 political prisoners , belarus has released its prisoners , " sikorski said .

eu officials say that a key question is whether belarus will follow russia 's lead and recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - something the eu firmly rejects .
" belarus can show real willingness to open up , move closer to western europe if they do not also recognize south ossetia and abkhazia .

the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .
osi said it has won cases against 107 individuals who assisted in nazi persecution during world war ii .
another 180 have been blocked from entering the us because of the osi 's watch-list .
one of the most famous ukrainian cases involved john demjanjuk , 88 , the ukrainian-born man alleged to have been a brutal guard at the nazi 's treblinka death camp .
in a case dating back 30 years , demjanjuk has been extradited to israel , acquitted by an israeli court , returned to the us and had his us citizenship revoked .
until recently , no country had offered to take him .
in june , germany 's top holocaust crimes prosecutor kurt schrimm said he would apply to the german high court for demjanjuk 's extradition to be prosecuted under german criminal law .
the court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .
although he insists that the film is really about love , dresen admits his intention to break a taboo with wolke 9 and show his audience that seniors are sexual beings too .
just a love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge has to choose between two lovers " of course it was important to me to show that old people do n't just go on bus tours and boat cruises and buy warm blankets , " he told die tageszeitung .
with inge 's cavorting between - or on top of the sheets , dresen indeed offers a different glimpse into old age .
his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .

" we have decided that there will be two -lrb- informal meetings -rrb- per presidency and per half year , and the next one will be held in paris , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the talks in the french town of avignon , said on friday , sept .
5 .
the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .
ever since 1974 , foreign ministers have held one informal meeting per presidency , on top of the usual half-dozen formal sessions that they hold .
the series is named " gymnich , " after the german castle where the first one was convened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first meeting was held in gymnich castle near the former german capital of bonn kouchner said that the second gymnich of the french presidency will be held in paris , and hinted that it would take place before the us election on nov .
4 .
the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .
however , the decision could well prove to be a headache for future presidencies , who will now have to fit an extra meeting of 27 foreign ministers in among the dozen informal meetings , two summits and several dozen formal ministerial sessions that they already have to hold in a six-month period . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .
but with the eu 's leaders having threatened to postpone talks on a strategic treaty with russia until it pulls out of georgia , they are unlikely to take a soft line .
" they -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not the ones to give people permission to people in the buffer zone .
they have no rights either to give permission or not to give it , " bildt said .
" we will deploy our mission to georgia without asking russia for permission , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 06.09.2008 eu set to approve observer mission to georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has called on russia to pull its troops out of the buffer zones the european union is set to give the go-ahead to a team of ceasefire observers for georgia at a formal meeting of foreign ministers on sept .
15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .
but with the eu 's leaders having threatened to postpone talks on a strategic treaty with russia until it pulls out of georgia , they are unlikely to take a soft line .
" they -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not the ones to give people permission to people in the buffer zone .

5 .
the troy , michigan , resident became a us citizen in 1955 .
us investigators charged that as a member of the uap , kalymon had helped round up jews , imprison them in a ghetto , terrorize them and supervise their forced labor , kill those trying to escape and lead survivors to extermination and forced labor camps , including belzec in poland .
evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .
it was not clear if he would be allowed to stay in the us .
osi said it has won cases against 107 individuals who assisted in nazi persecution during world war ii .
another 180 have been blocked from entering the us because of the osi 's watch-list .
one of the most famous ukrainian cases involved john demjanjuk , 88 , the ukrainian-born man alleged to have been a brutal guard at the nazi 's treblinka death camp .
in a case dating back 30 years , demjanjuk has been extradited to israel , acquitted by an israeli court , returned to the us and had his us citizenship revoked .
until recently , no country had offered to take him .
in june , germany 's top holocaust crimes prosecutor kurt schrimm said he would apply to the german high court for demjanjuk 's extradition to be prosecuted under german criminal law .
the court would first have to decide if german prosecutors had authority over the case . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 06.09.2008 eu looks for ties in russia 's backyard after georgia war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recognizing georgia 's rebel provinces would push belarus away from the eu the eu must open the door to a rapprochement with belarus and support reconstruction and peace in georgia and moldova if it is to counter russia 's growing assertiveness in eastern europe , eu foreign ministers said . " we should encourage belarus to improve the way they conduct their elections and we should give them incentives .
we need a process of rebuilding trust , " polish foreign minister radek sikorski told dpa news agency from the ministers ' informal meeting in avignon , france , on saturday , sept .
6 .
" it is a very good time to rethink our relations with belarus .
belarus is sending desperate signals to the west , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
officially , saturday 's talks were set to focus on the eu 's relationship with russia and georgia following their war in august .
sarkozy heads to moscow but with french president nicolas sarkozy - the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency - set to travel to moscow for talks on the issue on monday , the officials turned their focus to the question of how to respond to russia 's new assertiveness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski and his german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier during their talks , they discussed turkish proposals on maintaining stability in the caucasus and debated how the eu should strengthen international efforts to solve the conflict between moldova and its rebel region of transnistria - a process in which russia is currently pushing for a trilateral solution .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that he had spoken with moldovan president vladimir voronin on thursday , and that voronin stressed that he still saw the peace process as an internationally monitored process .
eu aid for georgia expected after the talks , foreign-affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the eu was likely to offer georgia financial assistance to help overcome the post-war economic crisis , with the total this year possibly reaching 100 million euros -lrb- $ 143 million -rrb- .
" the military destruction is much bigger than the civilian and we think that we have to assess our needs according to that ...
we will have to help , and we will do so , " she said .
and following belarus ' release of its final political prisoners during the summer , some eu ministers called for a strong sign to the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko that minsk has something to gain from bringing in democratic reforms .
belarus " is not a regime that we admire but we should recognize what has been done .
we now have an anomaly , we 've dropped sanctions on cuba where there are 260 political prisoners , belarus has released its prisoners , " sikorski said .
eu mulls lifting restrictions on belarus the eu currently has travel bans in place against belarusian regime figures , and its first step should therefore be to step up diplomatic contacts , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski said the eu does n't admire lukashenko 's regime ministers have decided in principle to invite belarusian foreign minister sergei martynov to talks in brussels , although it is not yet sure whether they will do so ahead of the next formal ministerial session on sept .
15 , kouchner told dpa .
however , member states remained divided on whether they should make a move before belarus holds elections on sept .
28 .
" it would be good to send some signals now , and in case of democratic free and fair elections to change -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- general policies , " vaitiekunas said .
" we 'll have to have a look at that at a later stage , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
eu officials say that a key question is whether belarus will follow russia 's lead and recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - something the eu firmly rejects .
" belarus can show real willingness to open up , move closer to western europe if they do not also recognize south ossetia and abkhazia .
but of course belarus at the moment is under very heavy pressure from russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .
in these states , the spd is almost guaranteed to limp in third place behind the left party .
the spd 's situation might have reached boiling point , but , in fact , the party 's crisis is a long-term one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle party chairman kurt beck , currently in an uncomfortable position between a rock and a hard place , is the party 's third leader since gerhard schroeder stepped down in 2004 in a bid to salvage the chancellorship .
schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .
but it is all the spd can do right now if it is to find its way ahead of the bundestag elections .
if it results in a clear goal , shared by the party , then it is a good thing .

7 , amid a serious identity crisis .
the party is unsure of its future direction - and there 's only one year to go before the next federal elections . the figures are alarming .
in recent months , surveys show that not even 30 percent of the electorate are backing the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
a new survey in saarland , where a regional parliament is to be elected next august , reveals that the spd is only the third most popular party - not only far behind the ruling christian democrats but also trailing the left party . for the first time ever in western germany - where unlike in eastern germany it can not rely on the support of former communist party members - the left party is more popular than the spd .
home territory it has a lot to do with the fact that left party chairman oskar lafontaine was a beloved state premier back in the days when he still belonged to the social democrats .
he has tilted his cap at this office once again .
but if he wins four weeks before the bundestag election , the repercussions will be fatal - especially since elections will also be taking place in thueringen and saxony on the same day as in saarland .
in these states , the spd is almost guaranteed to limp in third place behind the left party .
the spd 's situation might have reached boiling point , but , in fact , the party 's crisis is a long-term one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle party chairman kurt beck , currently in an uncomfortable position between a rock and a hard place , is the party 's third leader since gerhard schroeder stepped down in 2004 in a bid to salvage the chancellorship .
schroeder 's reform package was seen by some as an effective way of tackling unemployment , but by others as having deepened germany 's social divisions .
his reforms are most certainly the reason for the emergence of the left party as a force to be reckoned with both in eastern and western germany .
troubles go way back but the roots of the crisis go even deeper .
the party had already chewed up and spat out four chairmen during the 1990s , and gerhard schroeder 's victory in 1998 was not necessarily his own achievement , but proof that the public was fed up with helmut kohl after 16 years in power . the spd had long been struggling with the difficulties of reconciling the traditional workers ' party as it had existed in industrial times with the demands of a service-oriented society in a globalized world .
gerhard schroeder attempted to solve the problem his way - and the rest is history . against this background , the latest round of in-fighting merely adds to the burden .
but it is all the spd can do right now if it is to find its way ahead of the bundestag elections .
if it results in a clear goal , shared by the party , then it is a good thing .

" we want to be more equal partners with the us , but how can we do that ?
we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .
eu plans cooperation with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner hosted the meeting , as france currently holds the eu presidency " the world is dangerous , the return of nationalism and micro-nationalism impose on -lrb- the eu and us -rrb- a common vision and common steps , " he warned .

" it 's not to take advantage -lrb- of the change of administration -rrb- , but knowing that our american friends ... also wish that the eu should be politically present in the world 's problems , and take its political place , not just as a fund-raiser but a player in its matters of peace , and sometimes of war , " kouchner said .
but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier in the day , germany 's foreign minister called for a probe into the russian-georgian war " there are questions like climate change and energy security which need an answer , " solana said , adding that he hoped to present a " short and useful " new document to eu leaders by the end of the year .
tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "

in his provocative new film , german director andreas dresen depicts the sexual escapades of an elderly love triangle - wrinkles and all .
the nation 's media is captivated by the combination of lovemaking and liver spots . entitled wolke 9 -lrb- cloud 9 -rrb- , the film follows sexagenarian grandmother inge , played by ursula werner , as she engages in a passionate extra-marital affair with 76-year-old karl .
the two meet when karl has seamstress inge alter his trousers ; within minutes they are frolicking around on karl 's living room floor , just like teenagers .
viewers also see inge go at it with her late-in-life husband of 30 years in an old , creaky bed .
" yes , we can ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresen and the cast went to cannes for the film 's premiere the film , which snagged a small prize at the cannes film festival in may , premiered in berlin this week and has since made for some witty headlines on the culture pages of germany 's top newspapers .
calling age the next front in the sexual revolution , the berlin daily newspaper die tageszeitung displayed a picture of the film 's retired romancers in bed with the headline " yes , we can ! "
the film 's release also comes on the heels of a study last month by researchers at the university of chicago which found that more than three in four american men between the ages of 75 and 85 and every other woman in this same age bracket are still up for sex , reported afp news agency .

with inge 's cavorting between - or on top of the sheets , dresen indeed offers a different glimpse into old age .
his film comes at a time when germany is coming to terms with an ageing population as the birth rate drops and retirement homes may soon be overflowing . at the berlin premiere , dresen said he thinks the film 's love story about a woman torn between two lovers is more notable than the elderly eroticism .

" the new american administration will , as we all of course also , have to cope with the new emerging countries : apart from russia , which is an old power with a new assertiveness , india , brazil and china , " eu foreign policy commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said friday , sept .
5 .
" we want to be more equal partners with the us , but how can we do that ?
we have to raise our own game , we have to be more clear and united in the positions we are taking , we have to be more effective and forthcoming in using our policy and our instruments , " she said .
at an informal meeting in the french city of avignon , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states discussed how to cooperate with the next us president on questions of global security such as climate change and energy security , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the meeting , said .
eu plans cooperation with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner hosted the meeting , as france currently holds the eu presidency " the world is dangerous , the return of nationalism and micro-nationalism impose on -lrb- the eu and us -rrb- a common vision and common steps , " he warned .

but at the same time , he also criticized the policies of current us vice-president dick cheney , who on friday visited ukraine on a whirlwind tour of the former soviet union aimed at boosting ties in the wake of august 's georgian-russian war . cheney " has a certain sense of protecting people , but i 'm not so sure he had a lot of success with this particular sense , " he said .

tellingly , however , the original strategy of 2003 stresses the need for the eu to project its values around the world by working with international organizations such as the un and wto .
" the best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states , " it says , listing political and social reform and the defense of human rights as " the best means of strengthening the international order . "
and the rise of russia , china and india has alarmed eu diplomats , with the russian-georgian war and the collapse of wto talks in a row between china , india and the us both seen as signs that western domination of the international agenda can no longer be assured .
" over the last few years , you 've seen a determined effort on the part of europe and the americans to forge common positions on issues as diverse as iran , russia , and international development , " british foreign minister david miliband pointed out .

" we have decided that there will be two -lrb- informal meetings -rrb- per presidency and per half year , and the next one will be held in paris , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the talks in the french town of avignon , said on friday , sept .
5 .
the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .
ever since 1974 , foreign ministers have held one informal meeting per presidency , on top of the usual half-dozen formal sessions that they hold .
the series is named " gymnich , " after the german castle where the first one was convened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first meeting was held in gymnich castle near the former german capital of bonn kouchner said that the second gymnich of the french presidency will be held in paris , and hinted that it would take place before the us election on nov .
4 .
the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .
however , the decision could well prove to be a headache for future presidencies , who will now have to fit an extra meeting of 27 foreign ministers in among the dozen informal meetings , two summits and several dozen formal ministerial sessions that they already have to hold in a six-month period . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have decided that there will be two -lrb- informal meetings -rrb- per presidency and per half year , and the next one will be held in paris , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who chaired the talks in the french town of avignon , said on friday , sept .
5 .
the eu 's ministerial meetings are chaired by each of the bloc 's 27 member states in turn , with presidencies rotating every six months .
ever since 1974 , foreign ministers have held one informal meeting per presidency , on top of the usual half-dozen formal sessions that they hold .
the series is named " gymnich , " after the german castle where the first one was convened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first meeting was held in gymnich castle near the former german capital of bonn kouchner said that the second gymnich of the french presidency will be held in paris , and hinted that it would take place before the us election on nov .
4 .
the announcement to double the gymnichs is likely to be welcomed by ministers , since the meetings are , by tradition , held in a prestigious resort in the host country , and are not expected to arrive at any formal decisions .
however , the decision could well prove to be a headache for future presidencies , who will now have to fit an extra meeting of 27 foreign ministers in among the dozen informal meetings , two summits and several dozen formal ministerial sessions that they already have to hold in a six-month period . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , the ministers meeting informally in the french town of avignon said . the bloc should also consider calling for an international investigation to establish who is to blame for the recent war between georgia and russia , diplomats said friday , sept .
5 , in avignon .
" all the decisions will be taken on sept .
15 that we go for full deployment of an european security and defence policy mission in georgia , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said at an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
" i would expect that to start deploying in numbers in the second half of september , up to a force of several hundred , i would estimate , " he said .
since the war between russia and georgia started in august , the eu has been pushing for an international presence to replace the current massive russian military force in georgia 's breakaway provinces .
russia opposes observers but russia 's continued military presence not only in the provinces but in georgia itself , and its refusal to let observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- back into the conflict zones , has put that goal out of reach so far .
on monday , eu heads of state and government called on russia to pull its troops back to pre-conflict lines .
french president nicolas sarkozy is set to travel to moscow this coming monday as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency to hold talks on the matter .
" i have been in touch with the authorities -lrb- in russia -rrb- and with the georgians .
i think they understand what we want , what they have to do , and i hope very much that on monday there will be a success , " the eu 's top foreign-policy official , javier solana , who is also set to join the mission , said .
" i do have information that the osce observers are called into the so-called buffer zones -lrb- within georgia -rrb- .
so this is some opening there and i hope that will continue , " he said .
calls for inquiry into war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers raised the question of guilt ahead of friday 's informal meeting , eu ministers said that the international community should investigate how the war started - with some pointing to the role played by georgian president mikheil saakashvili , whose orders launched the georgian attack on its breakaway regions on the night of august 7 .
" if we are going to think about how our relationship should develop with the conflict partners ... it 's important to find out who played what role in the escalation leading up to the armed conflict , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" i think that president saakashvili carries a responsibility ...
the responsibility of those who started this conflict , also militarily , must be clearly established , and the responsibilities must be shown , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said .
not all ministers met the idea with enthusiasm , however . " i have from the beginning said that i am very careful in pointing the finger , i do n't want to do that , but if it is felt necessary to look at how it all started , how it went on after that , then let 's do it , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said .
extent of observer mission uncertain officially , ministers are due to discuss the georgian conflict on saturday , with officials as yet uncertain how far any mission would be able to deploy to the conflict zone .
" our forces should be on the border -lrb- between georgia and its breakaway regions -rrb- , not somewhere which might be 15 kilometers inland , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said .
but with the eu 's leaders having threatened to postpone talks on a strategic treaty with russia until it pulls out of georgia , they are unlikely to take a soft line .
" they -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not the ones to give people permission to people in the buffer zone .
they have no rights either to give permission or not to give it , " bildt said .

evidence of personal involvement he allegedly committed the crimes in lviv , formerly in poland and now part of ukraine , from 1941 to 1944 .
the court decision from thursday was announced friday by acting assistant attorney general matthew friedrich of the us justice department 's criminal division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalymon was accused of supervising forced laborers , among other crimes the court based its decision in part on uap documents , including one signed by kalymon that " proved that in 1942 he personally killed and wounded jews in lviv by shooting them , " a statement from the justice department said .
" the nazis and their collaborators killed more than 100,000 of lviv 's jews - ­ men , women and children whose only ' crime ' was their religion , " said eli rosenbaum , director of the office of special investigations that continues to probe nazi-era crimes .
he called the decision by the court , which serves michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky , an " important victory in the us government 's ongoing effort to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of nazi inhumanity . "
many of the uap 's and kalymon 's victims were sent to the belzec , poland , extermination center where they were murdered with poison gas , prosecutors said .
citizenship revoked the court ruled that kalymon had not been eligible for us citizenship because of his collaboration with the nazis , and because he hid this information when he applied for a us visa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 06.09.2008 german wine producers discover the art of pr großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost all wine grapes in the moselle area are hand picked after years of being thought of as cheap and sugary , german wine is enjoying huge international success .
it owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers . as the first grapes of this year 's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks , wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage .
but raimund pruem , who has been producing wine in the moselle valley for over 30 years , remembers a time when riesling was not so prosperous .
" the bad reputation of german wine really hurt us , " he said .
" i will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago .
the judges gave tremendous praise : against south african and australian wines , german riesling did the best .
but when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments . "
since then , however , german wine has made a comeback , particularly in the us after some moselle valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential american wine critic robert parker .
a new generation of customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pruem produces around one million bottles per year as german vintners do n't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards , most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online .
due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all riesling in the moselle valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive , high quality german wines remain relatively inexpensive - a new reputation that is prized by vintners .
but while germany 's sweet rieslings are by far the most popular in the us , the german market decidedly prefers the " trocken " variety , the dry wines .
ninety-five percent of the wine the s.a. pruem winery sells in germany is dry riesling .
" there is a generational problem , young people in germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore - they drink only drier , more expensive wines , " pruem said .
this is a relatively new development since a sudden change in german wine drinkers ' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet rieslings to bone dry .
such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands .
producers stepping up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most top german producers are members of the vdp quality wines organization although raimund pruem 's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities , the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next .
virtually all top vintners around the moselle have studied viticulture and vinification , gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world .
while pruem 's ancestors ' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking , today german wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too .
" when people come here they do n't want to meet the sales staff , they want to meet the producer , " pruem explained .
" who else is a better promoter than the producer himself ?
that 's something that has changed totally .
my grandfather , my father and even myself when i was younger - we saw how it does n't work sitting here , waiting for customers , you have to be active . "
there has to be a connection between the producer and his customers , he added : " customers need communication . "
as a result , more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings , wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events , touring the world with their wines .
an artful business bildunterschrift : wine has been produced in the moselle valley since before the romans the change in approach is evident .
producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more : bottles of other grape varieties such as pinot blanc and chardonnay - and even the occasional red wine - are increasingly found on tasting lists around the moselle valley .
but the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with .
" i have to sell my wine twice : first to the customer -lrb- the retailer -rrb- , then to my customer 's customer , " pruem said .
" you have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought . "
like most other wine producers , pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking : " the art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard . "
but he is also introducing a new art - that of public relations .
" my wines need to show character , if they do n't show character then forget it . " - pruem 's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself : if their wine fails to meet standards , then not only is their livelihood , passion and reputation at stake , but also their legacy . antony herrmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scale of the problem was " huge and terrifying " with cash and property worth tens of millions of pounds taken last year , action on elder abuse said .
solicitors say the rise in financial abuse is partly due to substantial rises in property values .
charities say a lack of awareness of the problem makes such crimes easy .
' widescale problem ' action on elder abuse says it has seen a rise in the number of people who contact its helpline because of financial abuse .
but daniel blake , policy manager at the charity , believed that the cases it was aware of were only the tip of the iceberg .
i was rather disgusted to be honest .
i had n't expected it .
it shook me at the time ' donald ' " what we know is that this affects hundreds of thousands of older people , " he said .
" the amounts of money are in the tens of millions of pounds being taken , stolen or defrauded from older people .
" we 're not saying this happens in every family , but this is a widescale problem involving massive amounts of money that actually mean a lot to older people and has a severe impact on their quality of life . "
the charity found that financial abuse can include : the direct theft of money and / or other possessions from an older person benefits belonging to the older person being withheld by family members older people being forced to sell their homes financial worries calls to the charity 's helpline suggested that where property was involved , about a quarter of victims had their homes sold or taken without their consent .
and in 3 % of cases , the house had been remortgaged by the abuser .
other cases involved direct theft of money , possessions , and benefits .
donald , not his real name , has discovered the cost of putting his trust in a close family member .
he and his wife have had around £ 85,000 stolen , and although around half of the money has been returned he said it has made him worry about his financial security .
" some money was taken from the sale of the house , which is probably the major item .
but there was also small bank accounts and building society accounts and allowances such as carer 's allowance , that sort of thing , " he told the bbc .
" i was rather disgusted to be honest .
i had n't expected it .
it shook me at the time .
it was very unfortunate .
it should never have happened . "
' not recognised ' last autumn the government strengthened protection for older people who suffer from dementia or other illnesses that affect their mental capacity .
but charities say that the problem of financial abuse has been allowed to grow because many people do not believe it can happen .
if someone was being physically abused you 'd expect to see bruises so you 'd know what to look for kate jolin help the aged the number of older people who become victims was almost certainly underestimated , said kate joplin of help the aged .
" many aged people are too embarrassed to say what has happened , or perhaps do not realise what has happened because of their mental decline , " she said .
social workers and other staff who deal with older people are trained to look for physical evidence of abuse , but not to enquire about their finances , ms joplin added .
" elderly financial abuse is not recognised as an issue so it 's not picked up , " she said .
" if someone was being physically abused you 'd expect to see bruises so you 'd know what to look for .
" we need to create a culture in which people can blow the whistle when they find something suspicious because we ca n't allow so may older people to be defrauded . "
take seriously helen freely , a solicitor who specialises in working with older people , said that theft involving property had been fuelled by years of rising house prices .
" it 's largely because elderly people bought their properties many years ago and they have increased in value .
many elderly people are sitting on a pot of money .
" also dementia is on the increase - we are an aging population - so that makes them vulnerable . "
charities have warned that until the problem is taken seriously , the levels of financial abuse will not come down .
a report on this can be seen on the bbc news channel during saturday 6 september .

" the amounts of money are in the tens of millions of pounds being taken , stolen or defrauded from older people .
" we 're not saying this happens in every family , but this is a widescale problem involving massive amounts of money that actually mean a lot to older people and has a severe impact on their quality of life . "
the charity found that financial abuse can include : the direct theft of money and / or other possessions from an older person benefits belonging to the older person being withheld by family members older people being forced to sell their homes financial worries calls to the charity 's helpline suggested that where property was involved , about a quarter of victims had their homes sold or taken without their consent .
and in 3 % of cases , the house had been remortgaged by the abuser .
other cases involved direct theft of money , possessions , and benefits .
donald , not his real name , has discovered the cost of putting his trust in a close family member .
he and his wife have had around £ 85,000 stolen , and although around half of the money has been returned he said it has made him worry about his financial security .
" some money was taken from the sale of the house , which is probably the major item .
but there was also small bank accounts and building society accounts and allowances such as carer 's allowance , that sort of thing , " he told the bbc .
" i was rather disgusted to be honest .
i had n't expected it .
it shook me at the time .
it was very unfortunate .
it should never have happened . "
' not recognised ' last autumn the government strengthened protection for older people who suffer from dementia or other illnesses that affect their mental capacity .
but charities say that the problem of financial abuse has been allowed to grow because many people do not believe it can happen . "
if someone was being physically abused you 'd expect to see bruises so you 'd know what to look for " kate jolin help the aged the number of older people who become victims was almost certainly underestimated , said kate joplin of help the aged .
" many aged people are too embarrassed to say what has happened , or perhaps do not realise what has happened because of their mental decline , " she said .
social workers and other staff who deal with older people are trained to look for physical evidence of abuse , but not to enquire about their finances , ms joplin added .
" elderly financial abuse is not recognised as an issue so it 's not picked up , " she said .
" if someone was being physically abused you 'd expect to see bruises so you 'd know what to look for .
" we need to create a culture in which people can blow the whistle when they find something suspicious because we ca n't allow so may older people to be defrauded . "
take seriously helen freely , a solicitor who specialises in working with older people , said that theft involving property had been fuelled by years of rising house prices .
" it 's largely because elderly people bought their properties many years ago and they have increased in value .
many elderly people are sitting on a pot of money .
" also dementia is on the increase - we are an aging population - so that makes them vulnerable . "
charities have warned that until the problem is taken seriously , the levels of financial abuse will not come down .
a report on this can be seen on the bbc news channel during saturday 6 september .

in monmouth , the town 's historic cornwall house and savoy theatre will open their doors while in pembrokeshire people will be given the chance to visit the world war ii carew cheriton airfield control tower .
this is a very special chance to learn about our hidden heritage or to find out something new about somewhere that may be familiar dr matthew griffiths - the civic trust for wales more than 300 events will take place over the next few weekends with the programme coming to an end on the weekend of 20 and 21 september .
a host of volunteers including civic societies , churches , local museums and building and site owners have organised the events which will provide a behind-the-scenes look at each venue aided by associated exhibitions , talks and , in some cases , concerts .
in 2007 , more than 40,000 people took advantage of the scheme in wales and organisers believe this year 's programme will be bigger than ever before .
dr matthew griffiths , of the civic trust for wales , said : " this is a very special chance to learn about our hidden heritage or to find out something new about somewhere that may be familiar .
" wales has a particularly rich heritage and the event offers everyone a chance to learn about more about its historic buildings and the importance of conserving our historic environment as a legacy for future generations . "
the public will be able to gain instant access to historic homes , castles , industrial sites , public buildings , museums and gardens .
but visits to some sites will need to be booked in advance as smaller historic buildings and some private homes can only cope with a few visitors at a time .
the open doors days scheme is part of the successful european heritage days which each celebrates europe 's common cultural heritage in more than 40 states and brings in 20m visitors each september .

but he added that unemployment - a factor which underpins people 's abilities to pay their mortgages - would not reach the highs of that era .
his comments add to a gloomy week of economic news , following chancellor alistair darling saying that the economic times faced globally " were arguably the worst they 've been in 60 years " .

" since it was the reduction in the availability of credit that precipitated the economic slowdown in the uk , mr hornby also implies that there 's little the government can do to restore positive momentum to the economy . "
many argue that the prime cause of the credit crunch in the uk was that banks had become too dependent on selling their mortgages to global investors in the form of mortgage-backed securities .
so the sudden unavailability of these deals deprived uk banks of much of the finance they needed - something which led to the eventual nationalisation of northern rock .

president ian craig said there had been significant losses in the black isle and easter ross in the highlands .
cold weather has led to eggs not being fertilised so producing more males than worker females .
the scottish government is due to announce the details of a bees strategy next week .
university of stirling-based bumblebee conservation trust has previously expressed grave concerns for the survival of wild bees . "
great parts of scotland have very little honey " ian craig scottish bee association mr craig , who runs bees in renfrewshire , said commercial honey producers and amateur beekeepers had serious worries about the effects of parasites , disease and a poor summer .
he said while it was thought colony collapse disorder - a condition wiping out bees in the us - had not reached scotland there were problems with varroa mite .
the parasites leave bee larvae deformed and can spread a condition called israeli paralysis virus .
bad weather has been a major factor - hitting both flowering plants visited by bees and the insects ' breeding .
mr craig said : " great parts of scotland have very little honey .
" the oilseed rape crop was poor and in some areas the heather has failed .
