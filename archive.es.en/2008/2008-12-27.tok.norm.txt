but not all of them deserved the applause . when it came to doping in sports , cycling proved to be at the epicenter - again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco tested positive for the use of epo even before the tour de france was over , five racers were exposed as doping offenders , among them riccardo ricco from italy who won two stages before being caught . for some athletes , like german professional jens voigt , the doping revelations are painful , but necessary . " this is the turning point , " he said .
" we will sort them all out , send them home and hopefully we do n't ever have to see them again . " lance armstrong returns this might as well prove to be wishful thinking - it is very likely that doping offenders like ivan basso will return in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong another cyclist who has been suspected of doping has announced he will compete again in the world 's most prestigious bike race in 2009 , lance armstrong . while the texan has won the tour de france seven times , he has always been surrounded by doping suspicions , said tour director christian prudhomme . " ever since winning what many called the fight of the century , his battle against cancer and then the tour de france in 1999 , there have been allegations of doping , " prudhomme said .
" but at the same time the fight against doping has become tougher and less compromising . " after the tour 2008 was finished , two more cyclists tested positive for doping .
austrian bernhard kohl , who was third overall . success for doping investigators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping investigation methods are improving gerolsteiner teammate stefan schumacher , a double stage winner in this year 's race , also tested positive .
as a consequence , team gerolsteiner was dissolved .
public broadcasters in germany decided to halt their live coverage of the tour de france in 2009 . kohl and schumacher were tested positive for the new generation of the epo blood booster , cera - a success for doping investigators such as professor wilhelm schaenzer from cologne . " i think those tests took them by surprise , " schaenzer said .
" apparently they thought the medication could not be traced . ” but doping was not just limited to cycling . before the olympic games in beijing had even begun , seven russian athletes were convicted of using performance-enhancing drugs .

26 , that its dispute with ukraine over payments could cause disruptions in deliveries to western europe , a news agency reported . gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said that gazprom head alexei miller had notified europe 's largest clients that it could not rule out the possibility of a cut off , according to itar-tass . " gazprom is doing everything possible to avoid any disruption of gas deliveries to europe , " said miller in the letter cited by the news agency . " however , if events develop along an unfavorable scenario , the problem of ukrainian transit will be a common problem for russia and europe , " miller said . at issue is the lack of progress in reaching agreement with ukraine 's naftogaz over $ 2 billion in non-payments for imports by kiev , with a new year 's deadline looming with threatened cut-offs by gazprom . gazprom supplies about one-quarter of the european union 's gas needs , 80 percent of which is shipped through ukraine . transit issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says it 's trying to resolve the dispute with ukraine , but ca n't guarantee european deliveries " we consider that it 's our duty to warn -lrb- europe -rrb- that we can not be sure that transit obligations will be respected , seeing that naftogaz is systematically slowing its contractual obligations , " miller said in his letter . in its letter , gazprom said it doubted it could uphold its obligations to deliver gas to western europe without resolution of the disagreements with naftogaz .
but gazprom pledged to do all it could to resolve the dispute . in a similar dispute in 2006 , russia blamed kiev for siphoning off gas to european customers - sparking fuel shortages and a price spike as far as paris . gazprom claims ukraine has paid only $ 800 million in arrears of its total debt , and analysts say the country 's crushing economic problems make reimbursing of more of the debt difficult . russian threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom takes care of 80 percent of the eu 's gas needs russian president dmitry medvedev told ukraine on wednesday to pay its gas debts " to the last ruble " or face the prospect of sanctions from moscow against its wider economy . medvedev did not say what sanctions russia could use against ukraine 's flagging economy but menacingly warned it had a " whole arsenal of possibilities " at its disposal . ukraine has begged a $ 16.4-billion loan from the international monetary fund , but conditions applied to the money means it can not directly be used pay its overdue gas bill . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all of them deserved the applause . when it came to doping in sports , cycling proved to be at the epicenter - again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco tested positive for the use of epo even before the tour de france was over , five racers were exposed as doping offenders , among them riccardo ricco from italy who won two stages before being caught . for some athletes , like german professional jens voigt , the doping revelations are painful , but necessary . " this is the turning point , " he said .
" we will sort them all out , send them home and hopefully we do n't ever have to see them again . " lance armstrong returns this might as well prove to be wishful thinking - it is very likely that doping offenders like ivan basso will return in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong another cyclist who has been suspected of doping has announced he will compete again in the world 's most prestigious bike race in 2009 , lance armstrong . while the texan has won the tour de france seven times , he has always been surrounded by doping suspicions , said tour director christian prudhomme . " ever since winning what many called the fight of the century , his battle against cancer and then the tour de france in 1999 , there have been allegations of doping , " prudhomme said .
" but at the same time the fight against doping has become tougher and less compromising . " after the tour 2008 was finished , two more cyclists tested positive for doping .
austrian bernhard kohl , who was third overall . success for doping investigators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping investigation methods are improving gerolsteiner teammate stefan schumacher , a double stage winner in this year 's race , also tested positive .
as a consequence , team gerolsteiner was dissolved .
public broadcasters in germany decided to halt their live coverage of the tour de france in 2009 . kohl and schumacher were tested positive for the new generation of the epo blood booster , cera - a success for doping investigators such as professor wilhelm schaenzer from cologne . " i think those tests took them by surprise , " schaenzer said .
" apparently they thought the medication could not be traced . ” but doping was not just limited to cycling . before the olympic games in beijing had even begun , seven russian athletes were convicted of using performance-enhancing drugs .
during the games , eight athletes failed doping tests , among them german show jumper christian ahlmann , whose horse coester tested positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamaica 's usain bolt set a new world record in the beijing men 's 100-meter final american swimmer michael phelps and jamaican sprinter usain bolt displayed spectacular performances - but also left the world wondering .
german scientist mario thevis was part of the doping control team in beijing . " some doubts remains if they reached their results without any enhancement drugs , " thevis said .
" but as long as we can not prove it , i consider the athletes innocent . " additional tests ordered over the course of the olympic games , 5,000 samples were taken .
currently those are being preserved in lausanne , switzerland , where the international olympic committee is based .
in january , additional tests with new methods will be conducted to discover the blood booster cera and insulin , which camouflages doping .
but armin baumer , head of germany 's anti-doping agency nada , played down the extra tests . " we will not ever have perfectly clean sports , " baumert said .
" there is no clean society , so there wo n't be clean sports .

" this is the turning point , " he said .
" we will sort them all out , send them home and hopefully we do n't ever have to see them again . " lance armstrong returns this might as well prove to be wishful thinking - it is very likely that doping offenders like ivan basso will return in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong another cyclist who has been suspected of doping has announced he will compete again in the world 's most prestigious bike race in 2009 , lance armstrong . while the texan has won the tour de france seven times , he has always been surrounded by doping suspicions , said tour director christian prudhomme . " ever since winning what many called the fight of the century , his battle against cancer and then the tour de france in 1999 , there have been allegations of doping , " prudhomme said .
" but at the same time the fight against doping has become tougher and less compromising . " after the tour 2008 was finished , two more cyclists tested positive for doping .

26 , that its dispute with ukraine over payments could cause disruptions in deliveries to western europe , a news agency reported . gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said that gazprom head alexei miller had notified europe 's largest clients that it could not rule out the possibility of a cut off , according to itar-tass . " gazprom is doing everything possible to avoid any disruption of gas deliveries to europe , " said miller in the letter cited by the news agency . " however , if events develop along an unfavorable scenario , the problem of ukrainian transit will be a common problem for russia and europe , " miller said . at issue is the lack of progress in reaching agreement with ukraine 's naftogaz over $ 2 billion in non-payments for imports by kiev , with a new year 's deadline looming with threatened cut-offs by gazprom . gazprom supplies about one-quarter of the european union 's gas needs , 80 percent of which is shipped through ukraine . transit issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says it 's trying to resolve the dispute with ukraine , but ca n't guarantee european deliveries " we consider that it 's our duty to warn -lrb- europe -rrb- that we can not be sure that transit obligations will be respected , seeing that naftogaz is systematically slowing its contractual obligations , " miller said in his letter . in its letter , gazprom said it doubted it could uphold its obligations to deliver gas to western europe without resolution of the disagreements with naftogaz .
but gazprom pledged to do all it could to resolve the dispute . in a similar dispute in 2006 , russia blamed kiev for siphoning off gas to european customers - sparking fuel shortages and a price spike as far as paris . gazprom claims ukraine has paid only $ 800 million in arrears of its total debt , and analysts say the country 's crushing economic problems make reimbursing of more of the debt difficult . russian threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom takes care of 80 percent of the eu 's gas needs russian president dmitry medvedev told ukraine on wednesday to pay its gas debts " to the last ruble " or face the prospect of sanctions from moscow against its wider economy . medvedev did not say what sanctions russia could use against ukraine 's flagging economy but menacingly warned it had a " whole arsenal of possibilities " at its disposal . ukraine has begged a $ 16.4-billion loan from the international monetary fund , but conditions applied to the money means it can not directly be used pay its overdue gas bill . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most countries are calling for restraint and urging negotiations . french president nicolas sarkozy accused israel of using disproportionate violence in its attacks on the gaza strip saturday . the bombardment must stop immediately , sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said in paris . sarkozy also condemned the launching of rockets by palestinian militants on israel from the gaza strip and called for an end to the " unjustifiable provocation " that had led to the current situation . there was no military solution in the gaza strip , he said . the eu is part of the so-called " quartet " seeking to negotiate peace in the middle east , with the united states , the united nations and russia .
the statement urged the " re-opening of all checkpoints and the immediate resumption of fuel and humanitarian aid deliveries . " casualties climbing bildunterschrift : smoke rises from israeli missile strikes in the northern gaza strip airstrikes by the israel defense forces -lrb- idf -rrb- directed at militants from the palestinian islamist movement hamas in the gaza strip have killed at least 195 palestinians , health officials in gaza said . more than 350 people have been injured in the strikes , security and medical officials said . in a statement , the israel defense force said : " the idf will continue its operations against terror in accordance with constant status assessments by the idf chief of general staff .
this operation will be continued , expanded and intensified as much as required . " palestinian president mahmud abbas and saudi king abdullah on saturday called for an immediate halt to the israeli raids , a palestinian diplomatic source told the afp news agency . " president abbas and the saudi sovereign discussed developments in the israeli aggression on the gaza strip and agreed to denounce it forcefully and urge an immediate halt to it , " the source told afp by telephone from rawdat kharim south of riyadh after the two leaders met . moscow and washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel says the operation will continue and be expanded as needed moscow added its voice saturday to calls for an immediate end to middle east violence . foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko called on israel to end its " combat activities which have already led to great loss and suffering among the peaceful palestinian population .

an international conference is due to go ahead in moscow in the new year . the united states on saturday urged restraint from israel in its military operations in the gaza strip , but simultaneously offered sharp criticism of hamas . white house spokesman gordon johndroe , according to cnn , said israel needs to avoid civilian deaths in its operations against hamas .
but , in the same statement , johndroe also lambasted hamas for its attacks on israel and its support for terrorism . arab world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is assisted as others are unloaded from vehicles outside a hospital egypt condemned israel 's air raids as " murder " and opened its rafah border crossing with the territory to allow the wounded through for treatment .

26 , that its dispute with ukraine over payments could cause disruptions in deliveries to western europe , a news agency reported . gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said that gazprom head alexei miller had notified europe 's largest clients that it could not rule out the possibility of a cut off , according to itar-tass . " gazprom is doing everything possible to avoid any disruption of gas deliveries to europe , " said miller in the letter cited by the news agency . " however , if events develop along an unfavorable scenario , the problem of ukrainian transit will be a common problem for russia and europe , " miller said . at issue is the lack of progress in reaching agreement with ukraine 's naftogaz over $ 2 billion in non-payments for imports by kiev , with a new year 's deadline looming with threatened cut-offs by gazprom . gazprom supplies about one-quarter of the european union 's gas needs , 80 percent of which is shipped through ukraine . transit issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says it 's trying to resolve the dispute with ukraine , but ca n't guarantee european deliveries " we consider that it 's our duty to warn -lrb- europe -rrb- that we can not be sure that transit obligations will be respected , seeing that naftogaz is systematically slowing its contractual obligations , " miller said in his letter . in its letter , gazprom said it doubted it could uphold its obligations to deliver gas to western europe without resolution of the disagreements with naftogaz .
but gazprom pledged to do all it could to resolve the dispute . in a similar dispute in 2006 , russia blamed kiev for siphoning off gas to european customers - sparking fuel shortages and a price spike as far as paris . gazprom claims ukraine has paid only $ 800 million in arrears of its total debt , and analysts say the country 's crushing economic problems make reimbursing of more of the debt difficult . russian threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom takes care of 80 percent of the eu 's gas needs russian president dmitry medvedev told ukraine on wednesday to pay its gas debts " to the last ruble " or face the prospect of sanctions from moscow against its wider economy . medvedev did not say what sanctions russia could use against ukraine 's flagging economy but menacingly warned it had a " whole arsenal of possibilities " at its disposal . ukraine has begged a $ 16.4-billion loan from the international monetary fund , but conditions applied to the money means it can not directly be used pay its overdue gas bill . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" lance armstrong returns this might as well prove to be wishful thinking - it is very likely that doping offenders like ivan basso will return in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong another cyclist who has been suspected of doping has announced he will compete again in the world 's most prestigious bike race in 2009 , lance armstrong . while the texan has won the tour de france seven times , he has always been surrounded by doping suspicions , said tour director christian prudhomme . " ever since winning what many called the fight of the century , his battle against cancer and then the tour de france in 1999 , there have been allegations of doping , " prudhomme said .
" but at the same time the fight against doping has become tougher and less compromising . " after the tour 2008 was finished , two more cyclists tested positive for doping .
austrian bernhard kohl , who was third overall . success for doping investigators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping investigation methods are improving gerolsteiner teammate stefan schumacher , a double stage winner in this year 's race , also tested positive .
as a consequence , team gerolsteiner was dissolved .
public broadcasters in germany decided to halt their live coverage of the tour de france in 2009 . kohl and schumacher were tested positive for the new generation of the epo blood booster , cera - a success for doping investigators such as professor wilhelm schaenzer from cologne . " i think those tests took them by surprise , " schaenzer said .
" apparently they thought the medication could not be traced . ” but doping was not just limited to cycling . before the olympic games in beijing had even begun , seven russian athletes were convicted of using performance-enhancing drugs .
during the games , eight athletes failed doping tests , among them german show jumper christian ahlmann , whose horse coester tested positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamaica 's usain bolt set a new world record in the beijing men 's 100-meter final american swimmer michael phelps and jamaican sprinter usain bolt displayed spectacular performances - but also left the world wondering .
german scientist mario thevis was part of the doping control team in beijing . " some doubts remains if they reached their results without any enhancement drugs , " thevis said .
" but as long as we can not prove it , i consider the athletes innocent . " additional tests ordered over the course of the olympic games , 5,000 samples were taken .
currently those are being preserved in lausanne , switzerland , where the international olympic committee is based .
in january , additional tests with new methods will be conducted to discover the blood booster cera and insulin , which camouflages doping .
but armin baumer , head of germany 's anti-doping agency nada , played down the extra tests . " we will not ever have perfectly clean sports , " baumert said .
" there is no clean society , so there wo n't be clean sports .
that 's an illusion .
but it can become cleaner . " dw staff -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all of them deserved the applause . when it came to doping in sports , cycling proved to be at the epicenter - again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riccardo ricco tested positive for the use of epo even before the tour de france was over , five racers were exposed as doping offenders , among them riccardo ricco from italy who won two stages before being caught . for some athletes , like german professional jens voigt , the doping revelations are painful , but necessary . " this is the turning point , " he said .
" we will sort them all out , send them home and hopefully we do n't ever have to see them again . " lance armstrong returns this might as well prove to be wishful thinking - it is very likely that doping offenders like ivan basso will return in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong another cyclist who has been suspected of doping has announced he will compete again in the world 's most prestigious bike race in 2009 , lance armstrong . while the texan has won the tour de france seven times , he has always been surrounded by doping suspicions , said tour director christian prudhomme . " ever since winning what many called the fight of the century , his battle against cancer and then the tour de france in 1999 , there have been allegations of doping , " prudhomme said .
" but at the same time the fight against doping has become tougher and less compromising . " after the tour 2008 was finished , two more cyclists tested positive for doping .
austrian bernhard kohl , who was third overall . success for doping investigators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping investigation methods are improving gerolsteiner teammate stefan schumacher , a double stage winner in this year 's race , also tested positive .
as a consequence , team gerolsteiner was dissolved .
public broadcasters in germany decided to halt their live coverage of the tour de france in 2009 . kohl and schumacher were tested positive for the new generation of the epo blood booster , cera - a success for doping investigators such as professor wilhelm schaenzer from cologne . " i think those tests took them by surprise , " schaenzer said .
" apparently they thought the medication could not be traced . ” but doping was not just limited to cycling . before the olympic games in beijing had even begun , seven russian athletes were convicted of using performance-enhancing drugs .
during the games , eight athletes failed doping tests , among them german show jumper christian ahlmann , whose horse coester tested positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamaica 's usain bolt set a new world record in the beijing men 's 100-meter final american swimmer michael phelps and jamaican sprinter usain bolt displayed spectacular performances - but also left the world wondering .
german scientist mario thevis was part of the doping control team in beijing . " some doubts remains if they reached their results without any enhancement drugs , " thevis said .
" but as long as we can not prove it , i consider the athletes innocent . " additional tests ordered over the course of the olympic games , 5,000 samples were taken .
currently those are being preserved in lausanne , switzerland , where the international olympic committee is based .
in january , additional tests with new methods will be conducted to discover the blood booster cera and insulin , which camouflages doping .
but armin baumer , head of germany 's anti-doping agency nada , played down the extra tests . " we will not ever have perfectly clean sports , " baumert said .
" there is no clean society , so there wo n't be clean sports .
that 's an illusion .
but it can become cleaner . " dw staff -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that its dispute with ukraine over payments could cause disruptions in deliveries to western europe , a news agency reported . gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said that gazprom head alexei miller had notified europe 's largest clients that it could not rule out the possibility of a cut off , according to itar-tass . " gazprom is doing everything possible to avoid any disruption of gas deliveries to europe , " said miller in the letter cited by the news agency . " however , if events develop along an unfavorable scenario , the problem of ukrainian transit will be a common problem for russia and europe , " miller said . at issue is the lack of progress in reaching agreement with ukraine 's naftogaz over $ 2 billion in non-payments for imports by kiev , with a new year 's deadline looming with threatened cut-offs by gazprom . gazprom supplies about one-quarter of the european union 's gas needs , 80 percent of which is shipped through ukraine . transit issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says it 's trying to resolve the dispute with ukraine , but ca n't guarantee european deliveries " we consider that it 's our duty to warn -lrb- europe -rrb- that we can not be sure that transit obligations will be respected , seeing that naftogaz is systematically slowing its contractual obligations , " miller said in his letter . in its letter , gazprom said it doubted it could uphold its obligations to deliver gas to western europe without resolution of the disagreements with naftogaz .
but gazprom pledged to do all it could to resolve the dispute . in a similar dispute in 2006 , russia blamed kiev for siphoning off gas to european customers - sparking fuel shortages and a price spike as far as paris . gazprom claims ukraine has paid only $ 800 million in arrears of its total debt , and analysts say the country 's crushing economic problems make reimbursing of more of the debt difficult . russian threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom takes care of 80 percent of the eu 's gas needs russian president dmitry medvedev told ukraine on wednesday to pay its gas debts " to the last ruble " or face the prospect of sanctions from moscow against its wider economy . medvedev did not say what sanctions russia could use against ukraine 's flagging economy but menacingly warned it had a " whole arsenal of possibilities " at its disposal . ukraine has begged a $ 16.4-billion loan from the international monetary fund , but conditions applied to the money means it can not directly be used pay its overdue gas bill . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but vaclav klaus , president of the czech republic , may be relishing his country 's assumption of eu leadership in january for very different reasons - as an opportunity to publicise views which other eu leaders will not enjoy hearing .
for mr klaus , a steely , bespectacled economist who came to sudden prominence after the czechoslovak revolution against communism , is a vehement eurosceptic .
he believes the eu has echoes of the old soviet bloc he used to live under .
and he is also an enthusiastic challenger of european and international policy on everything from climate change to relations with russia .
constant dissidence mr klaus gave a foretaste of what the eu can expect on an official visit to ireland in november .
upsetting his irish hosts , he ostentatiously visited declan ganley , leader of the successful irish no campaign against ratification of the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
klaus compared ganley and his supporters to dissidents in the old communist bloc - which angered many former czech dissidents who suffered persecution and imprisonment for their views .
but mr klaus likes to think of his life as a kind of constant dissidence against what he sees as the erroneous views of the majority .
he was born in prague in 1941 during the wartime nazi occupation .
as an economics student in post-war communist czechoslovakia , he was allowed to study in italy and the united states during the political thaw of the mid-to-late 1960s .
but the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 ended all hope of wider international opportunities for bright young czechs .
klaus , who refused to join the communist party , could not aspire to a senior academic or business job .
but he was allowed to earn his living in the 1970s and 80s in a post at the czechoslovak national bank .
he did not join the more open campaign of opposition to the communist regime led , among others , by the playwright vaclav havel .
but as political restraints eased again in the late 1980s klaus did organise seminars to discuss free-market economics .
self-assured ' genius ' he was always supremely self-confident or , as his critics put it , arrogant .
according to files published last year in the czech press , a communist secret policeman sent to monitor klaus 's seminars concluded that " he feels like an unappreciated genius " .
but then , in late 1989 , the chance to be appreciated dramatically appeared as communist rule collapsed .
klaus turned up at the magic lantern theatre , headquarters of the civic forum opposition , led by havel .
his economic expertise , good command of english and ability to handle the international media won him rapid advancement .
but he remained very different from havel and those closest to him .
while the latter dressed informally , and liked to discuss politics philosophically over beer and cigarettes , klaus wore blazers and ties , consumed raw vegetables and mineral water and lectured all and sundry on economic theory .
thatcher fan he built his political career in the early 1990s as a finance minister promoting rapid free-market reforms , founding and leading a conservative civic democratic party modelled partly on the british tories .
pictures of margaret thatcher featured prominently in his publicity material .
in 1992 , after their parties did well in federal elections , klaus and the slovak leader vladimir meciar controversially negotiated the splitting of czechoslovakia into two independent states , without a referendum .
klaus became prime minister of the czech republic .
but he became an increasingly frustrated figure as czech politics became bogged down in stalemate , with parties of the left remaining much more influential than klaus had hoped .
there were also corruption allegations surrounding the privatisation programmes he had introduced and the financing of his political party .
comecon klaus resigned as prime minister in 1997 , but managed to secure election as czech president in 2003 , in succession to vaclav havel .
their feuding was constant .
klaus called havel elitist - " i am a normal person , he is not , " he said .
havel has said of klaus that he only has two ways of behaving : " either he 's afraid of someone .
or he 's out to humiliate him . "
as president , klaus has had less executive power , but has felt freer to air his opinions , especially towards the eu .
" whenever i look at the berlaymont building -lrb- european commission hq -rrb- in brussels , " he once told the british politician norman lamont , " i seem to see the word comecon " - a reference to the old soviet-dominated communist trading organisation . "
vaclav klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what he once called ' business class eurocrats ' lording it over ' economy class slavs " ' while some czechs applaud this kind of view , opinion polls suggest a majority remain much more positive about the eu .
the list of klaus 's running battles with international orthodoxy grows ever longer .
he recently refused to join western condemnation of russian policy over georgia and he challenges international environmental policy .
his book disputing that man-made climate change is happening is entitled blue planet in green chains .
so during the coming months he will brood in his residence in the castle high above prague , refusing to fly the eu flag , while , his critics hope , the czech government is left to enjoy its time of european prominence in the city below .
but vaclav klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what he once called " business class eurocrats " lording it over " economy class slavs " , as this most combative of czechs condemns the error of europe 's ways .
chris bowlby 's profile of vaclav klaus was first broadcast on saturday , 27 december at 1900 gmt on bbc radio 4 .
it was repeated on sunday , 28 december at 05.45 gmt and 17.40 gmt .

but vaclav klaus , president of the czech republic , may be relishing his country 's assumption of eu leadership in january for very different reasons - as an opportunity to publicise views which other eu leaders will not enjoy hearing .
for mr klaus , a steely , bespectacled economist who came to sudden prominence after the czechoslovak revolution against communism , is a vehement eurosceptic .
he believes the eu has echoes of the old soviet bloc he used to live under .
and he is also an enthusiastic challenger of european and international policy on everything from climate change to relations with russia .
constant dissidence mr klaus gave a foretaste of what the eu can expect on an official visit to ireland in november .
upsetting his irish hosts , he ostentatiously visited declan ganley , leader of the successful irish no campaign against ratification of the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
klaus compared ganley and his supporters to dissidents in the old communist bloc - which angered many former czech dissidents who suffered persecution and imprisonment for their views .
but mr klaus likes to think of his life as a kind of constant dissidence against what he sees as the erroneous views of the majority .
the soviet-led invasion in 1968 curtailed freedoms in czechoslovakia he was born in prague in 1941 during the wartime nazi occupation .
as an economics student in post-war communist czechoslovakia , he was allowed to study in italy and the united states during the political thaw of the mid-to-late 1960s .
but the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 ended all hope of wider international opportunities for bright young czechs .
klaus , who refused to join the communist party , could not aspire to a senior academic or business job .
but he was allowed to earn his living in the 1970s and 80s in a post at the czechoslovak national bank .
he did not join the more open campaign of opposition to the communist regime led , among others , by the playwright vaclav havel .
but as political restraints eased again in the late 1980s klaus did organise seminars to discuss free-market economics .
self-assured ' genius ' he was always supremely self-confident or , as his critics put it , arrogant .
according to files published last year in the czech press , a communist secret policeman sent to monitor klaus 's seminars concluded that " he feels like an unappreciated genius " .
the clean-living klaus instigated rapid reform as czech finance minister but then , in late 1989 , the chance to be appreciated dramatically appeared as communist rule collapsed .
klaus turned up at the magic lantern theatre , headquarters of the civic forum opposition , led by havel .
his economic expertise , good command of english and ability to handle the international media won him rapid advancement .
but he remained very different from havel and those closest to him .
while the latter dressed informally , and liked to discuss politics philosophically over beer and cigarettes , klaus wore blazers and ties , consumed raw vegetables and mineral water and lectured all and sundry on economic theory .
thatcher fan he built his political career in the early 1990s as a finance minister promoting rapid free-market reforms , founding and leading a conservative civic democratic party modelled partly on the british tories .
margaret thatcher was a political and economic inspiration for vaclav klaus .
pictures of margaret thatcher featured prominently in his publicity material .
in 1992 , after their parties did well in federal elections , klaus and the slovak leader vladimir meciar controversially negotiated the splitting of czechoslovakia into two independent states , without a referendum .
klaus became prime minister of the czech republic .
but he became an increasingly frustrated figure as czech politics became bogged down in stalemate , with parties of the left remaining much more influential than klaus had hoped .
there were also corruption allegations surrounding the privatisation programmes he had introduced and the financing of his political party .
comecon klaus resigned as prime minister in 1997 , but managed to secure election as czech president in 2003 , in succession to vaclav havel .
their feuding was constant .
klaus called havel elitist - " i am a normal person , he is not , " he said .
havel has said of klaus that he only has two ways of behaving : " either he 's afraid of someone .
or he 's out to humiliate him . "
as president , klaus has had less executive power , but has felt freer to air his opinions , especially towards the eu .
" whenever i look at the berlaymont building -lrb- european commission hq -rrb- in brussels , " he once told the british politician norman lamont , " i seem to see the word comecon " - a reference to the old soviet-dominated communist trading organisation .
vaclav klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what he once called ' business class eurocrats ' lording it over ' economy class slavs ' while some czechs applaud this kind of view , opinion polls suggest a majority remain much more positive about the eu .
the list of klaus 's running battles with international orthodoxy grows ever longer .
he recently refused to join western condemnation of russian policy over georgia and he challenges international environmental policy .
his book disputing that man-made climate change is happening is entitled blue planet in green chains .
so during the coming months he will brood in his residence in the castle high above prague , refusing to fly the eu flag , while , his critics hope , the czech government is left to enjoy its time of european prominence in the city below .
but vaclav klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what he once called " business class eurocrats " lording it over " economy class slavs " , as this most combative of czechs condemns the error of europe 's ways .
chris bowlby 's profile of vaclav klaus was first broadcast on saturday , 27 december at 1900 gmt on bbc radio 4 .
it was repeated on sunday , 28 december at 05.45 gmt and 17.40 gmt .

he recently refused to join western condemnation of russian policy over georgia and he challenges international environmental policy .
his book disputing that man-made climate change is happening is entitled blue planet in green chains .
so during the coming months he will brood in his residence in the castle high above prague , refusing to fly the eu flag , while , his critics hope , the czech government is left to enjoy its time of european prominence in the city below .
but vaclav klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what he once called " business class eurocrats " lording it over " economy class slavs " , as this most combative of czechs condemns the error of europe 's ways .

but vaclav klaus , president of the czech republic , may be relishing his country 's assumption of eu leadership in january for very different reasons - as an opportunity to publicise views which other eu leaders will not enjoy hearing .
for mr klaus , a steely , bespectacled economist who came to sudden prominence after the czechoslovak revolution against communism , is a vehement eurosceptic .
he believes the eu has echoes of the old soviet bloc he used to live under .
and he is also an enthusiastic challenger of european and international policy on everything from climate change to relations with russia .
constant dissidence mr klaus gave a foretaste of what the eu can expect on an official visit to ireland in november .
upsetting his irish hosts , he ostentatiously visited declan ganley , leader of the successful irish no campaign against ratification of the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
klaus compared ganley and his supporters to dissidents in the old communist bloc - which angered many former czech dissidents who suffered persecution and imprisonment for their views .
but mr klaus likes to think of his life as a kind of constant dissidence against what he sees as the erroneous views of the majority .
the soviet-led invasion in 1968 curtailed freedoms in czechoslovakia he was born in prague in 1941 during the wartime nazi occupation .
as an economics student in post-war communist czechoslovakia , he was allowed to study in italy and the united states during the political thaw of the mid-to-late 1960s .
but the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 ended all hope of wider international opportunities for bright young czechs .
klaus , who refused to join the communist party , could not aspire to a senior academic or business job .
but he was allowed to earn his living in the 1970s and 80s in a post at the czechoslovak national bank .
he did not join the more open campaign of opposition to the communist regime led , among others , by the playwright vaclav havel .
but as political restraints eased again in the late 1980s klaus did organise seminars to discuss free-market economics .
self-assured ' genius ' he was always supremely self-confident or , as his critics put it , arrogant .
according to files published last year in the czech press , a communist secret policeman sent to monitor klaus 's seminars concluded that " he feels like an unappreciated genius " .
the clean-living klaus instigated rapid reform as czech finance minister but then , in late 1989 , the chance to be appreciated dramatically appeared as communist rule collapsed .
klaus turned up at the magic lantern theatre , headquarters of the civic forum opposition , led by havel .
his economic expertise , good command of english and ability to handle the international media won him rapid advancement .
but he remained very different from havel and those closest to him .
while the latter dressed informally , and liked to discuss politics philosophically over beer and cigarettes , klaus wore blazers and ties , consumed raw vegetables and mineral water and lectured all and sundry on economic theory .
thatcher fan he built his political career in the early 1990s as a finance minister promoting rapid free-market reforms , founding and leading a conservative civic democratic party modelled partly on the british tories .
margaret thatcher was a political and economic inspiration for vaclav klaus .
pictures of margaret thatcher featured prominently in his publicity material .
in 1992 , after their parties did well in federal elections , klaus and the slovak leader vladimir meciar controversially negotiated the splitting of czechoslovakia into two independent states , without a referendum .
klaus became prime minister of the czech republic .

but vaclav klaus , president of the czech republic , may be relishing his country 's assumption of eu leadership in january for very different reasons - as an opportunity to publicise views which other eu leaders will not enjoy hearing .
for mr klaus , a steely , bespectacled economist who came to sudden prominence after the czechoslovak revolution against communism , is a vehement eurosceptic .
he believes the eu has echoes of the old soviet bloc he used to live under .
and he is also an enthusiastic challenger of european and international policy on everything from climate change to relations with russia .
constant dissidence mr klaus gave a foretaste of what the eu can expect on an official visit to ireland in november .
upsetting his irish hosts , he ostentatiously visited declan ganley , leader of the successful irish no campaign against ratification of the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
klaus compared ganley and his supporters to dissidents in the old communist bloc - which angered many former czech dissidents who suffered persecution and imprisonment for their views .
but mr klaus likes to think of his life as a kind of constant dissidence against what he sees as the erroneous views of the majority .
the soviet-led invasion in 1968 curtailed freedoms in czechoslovakia he was born in prague in 1941 during the wartime nazi occupation .
as an economics student in post-war communist czechoslovakia , he was allowed to study in italy and the united states during the political thaw of the mid-to-late 1960s .
but the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 ended all hope of wider international opportunities for bright young czechs .
klaus , who refused to join the communist party , could not aspire to a senior academic or business job .
but he was allowed to earn his living in the 1970s and 80s in a post at the czechoslovak national bank .
he did not join the more open campaign of opposition to the communist regime led , among others , by the playwright vaclav havel .
but as political restraints eased again in the late 1980s klaus did organise seminars to discuss free-market economics .
self-assured ' genius ' he was always supremely self-confident or , as his critics put it , arrogant .
according to files published last year in the czech press , a communist secret policeman sent to monitor klaus 's seminars concluded that " he feels like an unappreciated genius " .
the clean-living klaus instigated rapid reform as czech finance minister but then , in late 1989 , the chance to be appreciated dramatically appeared as communist rule collapsed .
klaus turned up at the magic lantern theatre , headquarters of the civic forum opposition , led by havel .
his economic expertise , good command of english and ability to handle the international media won him rapid advancement .
but he remained very different from havel and those closest to him .
while the latter dressed informally , and liked to discuss politics philosophically over beer and cigarettes , klaus wore blazers and ties , consumed raw vegetables and mineral water and lectured all and sundry on economic theory .
thatcher fan he built his political career in the early 1990s as a finance minister promoting rapid free-market reforms , founding and leading a conservative civic democratic party modelled partly on the british tories .
margaret thatcher was a political and economic inspiration for vaclav klaus .
pictures of margaret thatcher featured prominently in his publicity material .
in 1992 , after their parties did well in federal elections , klaus and the slovak leader vladimir meciar controversially negotiated the splitting of czechoslovakia into two independent states , without a referendum .
klaus became prime minister of the czech republic .
but he became an increasingly frustrated figure as czech politics became bogged down in stalemate , with parties of the left remaining much more influential than klaus had hoped .
there were also corruption allegations surrounding the privatisation programmes he had introduced and the financing of his political party .
comecon klaus resigned as prime minister in 1997 , but managed to secure election as czech president in 2003 , in succession to vaclav havel .
their feuding was constant .
klaus called havel elitist - " i am a normal person , he is not , " he said .
havel has said of klaus that he only has two ways of behaving : " either he 's afraid of someone .
or he 's out to humiliate him . "
as president , klaus has had less executive power , but has felt freer to air his opinions , especially towards the eu .
" whenever i look at the berlaymont building -lrb- european commission hq -rrb- in brussels , " he once told the british politician norman lamont , " i seem to see the word comecon " - a reference to the old soviet-dominated communist trading organisation .
vaclav klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what he once called ' business class eurocrats ' lording it over ' economy class slavs ' while some czechs applaud this kind of view , opinion polls suggest a majority remain much more positive about the eu .
the list of klaus 's running battles with international orthodoxy grows ever longer .
he recently refused to join western condemnation of russian policy over georgia and he challenges international environmental policy .
his book disputing that man-made climate change is happening is entitled blue planet in green chains .
so during the coming months he will brood in his residence in the castle high above prague , refusing to fly the eu flag , while , his critics hope , the czech government is left to enjoy its time of european prominence in the city below .
but vaclav klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what he once called " business class eurocrats " lording it over " economy class slavs " , as this most combative of czechs condemns the error of europe 's ways .
chris bowlby 's profile of vaclav klaus was first broadcast on saturday , 27 december at 1900 gmt on bbc radio 4 .
it was repeated on sunday , 28 december at 05.45 gmt and 17.40 gmt .

reviewing 2008 , they said the cold spring and wet summer made it a bad year for insects , however the large cabbage white butterfly benefited from having fewer predators .
the year was shaping up to be a good one for the purple emperor as well , until britain ’ s second largest species of butterfly was hit by gale-force winds in late july .
radio tracking of lesser horseshoe bats did not take place in north wales during december because many were underweight as a result of low insect numbers .
experts warn that this might affect winter survival rates for all bat species .

on 18 june ffos las will become the first turf track to open in the uk for more than 80 years .
built on 600 acres on a former opencast site between llanelli and carmarthen , almost £ 30m will have been spent .
dai walters , the millionaire behind the development , is confident it will quickly become established as one of the best in the country , and he has described it as a gift to wales .
the track , along with parade ring and infrastructure , are in place .
construction of the 120 horse stable block is well underway and the grandstand is slowly starting to take shape .
i would rate this as one of the top five racecourses in the country dai walters mr walters , who started a plant hire , civil engineering and earthworks company in 1982 , said : " once we had planning it was like building a motorway - you just get on and get it done . "
it will stage eight flat and jump meetings in 2009 and 16 the following year .
it is hoped up to 4,000 punters will turn up for night fixtures and as many as 8,000 for weekend meetings .
several big name trainers including peter bowen are based in west wales and with the ferry links between pembrokeshire and ireland , the aim is to attract irish trainers as well .
" they want to come here and will come here , " said mr walters , who owns 30 race horses himself .
" i would rate this as one of the top five racecourses in the country .
" it 's a big long galloping track and we were very determined to have it as one of the top tracks .
we have done everything to get that and i think everybody will be impressed when they run their horses here .
" the bends are right , the cambers are right , everything is right .
the race course has been built on a former opencast mine enlarge image " good horses are very expensive .
they will come here because this is one of the safest galloping tracks in the country . "
over 100 staff will be needed on race days and mr walters said the benefits to the wider community would be great .
the fact it is created on an open cast site that once employed hundreds of miners before it finally closed a decade ago is not lost on him .
" i wanted to do something for wales , " he said .
" steel and coal is very quiet .
all that is left in wales at the moment is for tourists .
" they are telling me that a lot of the local hotels are booked already - it 's good for the community . "
he is confident that irish punters will also travel to meetings .
" with the pound against the euro now , i want them to be spending it in ffos las .
" i 'm really excited and proud it 's in wales . "
ffos las will be managed by northern racing , which operates nine other courses in the uk , including hereford , sedgefield , newcastle and chepstow , which is home to the welsh grand national .
" one day we will have the welsh grand national here , " mr walters confidently predicted .

on 18 june ffos las will become the first turf track to open in the uk for more than 80 years .
built on 600 acres on a former opencast site between llanelli and carmarthen , almost £ 30m will have been spent .
dai walters , the millionaire behind the development , is confident it will quickly become established as one of the best in the country , and he has described it as a gift to wales .
the track , along with parade ring and infrastructure , are in place .
construction of the 120 horse stable block is well underway and the grandstand is slowly starting to take shape .
i would rate this as one of the top five racecourses in the country dai walters mr walters , who started a plant hire , civil engineering and earthworks company in 1982 , said : " once we had planning it was like building a motorway - you just get on and get it done . "
it will stage eight flat and jump meetings in 2009 and 16 the following year .
it is hoped up to 4,000 punters will turn up for night fixtures and as many as 8,000 for weekend meetings .
several big name trainers including peter bowen are based in west wales and with the ferry links between pembrokeshire and ireland , the aim is to attract irish trainers as well .
" they want to come here and will come here , " said mr walters , who owns 30 race horses himself .
" i would rate this as one of the top five racecourses in the country .
" it 's a big long galloping track and we were very determined to have it as one of the top tracks .
we have done everything to get that and i think everybody will be impressed when they run their horses here .
" the bends are right , the cambers are right , everything is right .
the race course has been built on a former opencast mine enlarge image " good horses are very expensive .
they will come here because this is one of the safest galloping tracks in the country . "
over 100 staff will be needed on race days and mr walters said the benefits to the wider community would be great .
the fact it is created on an open cast site that once employed hundreds of miners before it finally closed a decade ago is not lost on him .
" i wanted to do something for wales , " he said .
" steel and coal is very quiet .
all that is left in wales at the moment is for tourists .
" they are telling me that a lot of the local hotels are booked already - it 's good for the community . "
he is confident that irish punters will also travel to meetings .
" with the pound against the euro now , i want them to be spending it in ffos las .
" i 'm really excited and proud it 's in wales . "
ffos las will be managed by northern racing , which operates nine other courses in the uk , including hereford , sedgefield , newcastle and chepstow , which is home to the welsh grand national .
" one day we will have the welsh grand national here , " mr walters confidently predicted .
