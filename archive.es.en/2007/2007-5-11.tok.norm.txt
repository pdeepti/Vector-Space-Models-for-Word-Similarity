miriam gruss , a parliamentarian from the opposition free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- added that the government just did n't want to realize that growing xenophobia was posing a huge threat to society at large .
" every fourth german harbors anti-foreigner sentiments , " said gruss .

among other tasteless comments , npd lawmaker holger apfel " this multi-coloured germany is an outrageous injustice " and that german politicians should finally realize that " arrogant black people , tartar tribesmen and state-subsidized oriental mega-families " could never be integrated into german society .

11 , 2001 attacks and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he claims to have been tortured until his release in august 2006 - despite a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's chief of staff thomas de maiziere praised the chancellor 's intervention in the kurnaz case kurnaz was freed after chancellor angela merkel came to power in 2005 and raised the issue of his captivity with us president george bush .
by then , however , the man dubbed " bremen taliban " by the german press , had spent four and a half years languishing in the notorious us camp for terrorist suspects and those designated as " enemy combatants . "
" we made a compromise decision in which the humanitarian aspect took precedent over the security interests , " de maiziere said on thursday after testifying before a parliamentary committee investigating the affair .
the committee is probing whether the previous government - led by social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder - turned down an offer by the us to release kurnaz in 2002 after american officials found he posed no danger , as is claimed by kurnaz .
born in germany # b # de maiziere said that angela merkel 's government intervened on kurnaz ' behalf because he was born and grew up in germany .
" we felt responsible for making the decision we made , " de maiziere said .
de maiziere , who is a member of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , chose not to criticize the former social democrat-green government saying that one could not compare the situation in the immediate aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and circumstances four years later .
schröder 's government has been criticized in germany for not doing enough to help kurnaz get released earlier .
kurnaz is now living in his home city of bremen .
last month he published a memoir which paints a disturbing picture of the time he spent imprisoned in guantanamo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-guantanamo inmate publishes memoir former guantanamo inmate and german-born turkish citizen murat kurnaz has published a harrowing account of the time he spent in the notorious us prison .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .

several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 11.05.2007 german minimum wage debate exposes deep left-right divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restaurant and hotel industry is one of the biggest low-wage sectors in germany unlike the us and many other eu countries , germany has no statutory minimum wage , and debate has reignited over introducing one .
one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .
" among economists , it 's pretty clear what would happen , " he said .
" the debate on the other side has relatively little to do with economics , it 's a discussion about justice . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at may day rallies , german unions demand minimum wage speaking at the main trade union rally of the day , michael sommer , chairman of the umbrella dgb labor federation , demanded a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- an hour .
-lrb- 01.05.2007 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
" he has brought to europe energy , engagement and ideas and leaves an impressive legacy including his commitment to enlargement , energy policy , his promotion of action against climate change , and for fighting poverty in africa . ”
" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "
merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .
danish pm hails a friend of denmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen appreciated blair 's cooperation prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said that blair had brought their two countries closer together and praised his willingness to cooperate in european and international politics .
" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration . "
irish leaders join chorus of approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern called blair a friend of ireland special tribute to blair 's " priceless legacy of peace " came from irish prime minister bertie ahern just two days after catholic and protestant political leaders took office in a restored power-sharing government in northern ireland .
" tony blair leaves office with an honored place in our history assured , " ahern said .
" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .
they believe he was too willing to offer concessions to republicans , which may have delayed the progress that has been achieved recently , " he added .
" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
" he has brought to europe energy , engagement and ideas and leaves an impressive legacy including his commitment to enlargement , energy policy , his promotion of action against climate change , and for fighting poverty in africa . ”
" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "
merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .
danish pm hails a friend of denmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen appreciated blair 's cooperation prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said that blair had brought their two countries closer together and praised his willingness to cooperate in european and international politics .
" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration . "

" tony blair leaves office with an honored place in our history assured , " ahern said .
" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .
they believe he was too willing to offer concessions to republicans , which may have delayed the progress that has been achieved recently , " he added .
" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "

he 's now set to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected . james " gordon " brown does n't immediately strike you as a 21st century center-left politician .
he lacks the charm and camera-friendly nature of former us president bill clinton and his long-standing colleague tony blair . but blair is often accused of being all style and no substance , which is also a charge which the retiring prime minister often levels at the leader of the uk opposition : conservative leader david cameron . brown , on the other hand , has never been part of this new generation of smooth-talking , well-groomed politicians .
if anything , with his rumpled suit , rotund physique and unruly thatch of hair , he is probably all substance and no style . uk voters also seem to have noticed this difference in labour 's two foremost politicians . " brown is more old , traditional labour rather than the new trendy blairite labour , " said one voter . " blair 's become very , very slick , " said another .
" whereas gordon brown 's still got the raw roots political blood in him , which you do n't see with blair any more . " the brown biography bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edinburgh , where brown studied brown 's father , john , was a scottish presbyterian minister .
brown is deeply religious himself , but also supports secular democracy and hardly ever discusses his religious beliefs . however , his faith does indirectly show its face in his policy decisions .
he is committed to combating world poverty and famed for his charitable endeavors . once , in a critique of european agricultural subsidies , brown famously quipped , " we spend more on cows than the poor . " his altruism is also reflected in a decade of gradually increasing taxation and public spending with brown in control of the purse strings .
critics wonder if he is in fact too charitable and trusting - whether he will overtax as party leader and drive voters away . at school he was extremely successful , gaining entry to the university of edinburgh aged just 16 .
brown completed a doctorate in history , writing his phd thesis on his beloved labour party .
he also carries one significant scar from his university days : because of a detached retina , possibly from a university rugby match , he is blind in his left eye .
brown will be only the second university-educated prime minister not to have attended either oxford or cambridge , britain 's two premier universities . after brief careers as a lecturer and then a journalist , both while still working in his native scotland , brown turned to politics .
by 1983 he had a seat in british parliament , elected as labour mp for dunfermline east .
his colleagues offer very mixed feedback .
he tends to surround himself with smaller groups of trusted colleagues and shut out others - labour politicians sometimes raise fears that brown will not take advice from all quarters , and may have to struggle to keep the party united . the private man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has played second fiddle long enough brown married his long-time girlfriend sarah macauley in 2000 .
their first child , jennifer jane , was born prematurely and lived only 12 days .
they now have two sons , john aged 3 , and baby james fraser , who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis . but even when talking about his family , brown is famously known to be unable to leave political emphasis and repetition behind ; once saying - " i 'm a father ; that 's what matters most .
nothing matters more . " brown is a huge soccer fan and a life-long supporter of raith rovers soccer club - a lower league side based near his childhood home .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .
" among economists , it 's pretty clear what would happen , " he said .
" the debate on the other side has relatively little to do with economics , it 's a discussion about justice .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .

" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .
" among economists , it 's pretty clear what would happen , " he said .
" the debate on the other side has relatively little to do with economics , it 's a discussion about justice .

" " i 'm absolutely delighted to give my full support to gordon as the next leader of the labour party and prime minister and to endorse him fully , " blair told reporters .
" i think he 's got what it takes to lead the labour party , and indeed the country , with distinction .
he 's an extraordinary and rare talent and it 's tremendous if it is put at the service of the nation , as it now can be . "
" he 's shown , perhaps as the most successful chancellor in our country 's history , that he 's got the strength , the experience and the judgment to make a great prime minister . "
blair , who announced on thursday that he will stand down on june 27 , has until now declined formally to back brown , with whom his relations have long been strained .
blair says brown can make a difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown finally gets his chance to take the reins on friday he said of brown : " i know he 's absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade .

" and so i wish him well .
i 'm delighted to support him and endorse him fully . "
brown is almost certain to succeed blair , as he is expected to face just a token challenge from the left wing of the center-left labour party .

" i think the relationship will be very close , in part because britain and the united states are such key allies , " rice told bbc radio .
" the bonds with prime minister blair have been forged through some of the most difficult times , through the time of 9/11 , through the time of the attacks on london , through afghanistan and iraq and northern ireland and those are bonds of friendship that come from having been through some of the toughest circumstances .

" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .

the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast .

he 's now set to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected . james " gordon " brown does n't immediately strike you as a 21st century center-left politician .
he lacks the charm and camera-friendly nature of former us president bill clinton and his long-standing colleague tony blair . but blair is often accused of being all style and no substance , which is also a charge which the retiring prime minister often levels at the leader of the uk opposition : conservative leader david cameron . brown , on the other hand , has never been part of this new generation of smooth-talking , well-groomed politicians .
if anything , with his rumpled suit , rotund physique and unruly thatch of hair , he is probably all substance and no style . uk voters also seem to have noticed this difference in labour 's two foremost politicians . " brown is more old , traditional labour rather than the new trendy blairite labour , " said one voter . " blair 's become very , very slick , " said another .
" whereas gordon brown 's still got the raw roots political blood in him , which you do n't see with blair any more . " the brown biography bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edinburgh , where brown studied brown 's father , john , was a scottish presbyterian minister .
brown is deeply religious himself , but also supports secular democracy and hardly ever discusses his religious beliefs . however , his faith does indirectly show its face in his policy decisions .
he is committed to combating world poverty and famed for his charitable endeavors . once , in a critique of european agricultural subsidies , brown famously quipped , " we spend more on cows than the poor . " his altruism is also reflected in a decade of gradually increasing taxation and public spending with brown in control of the purse strings .
critics wonder if he is in fact too charitable and trusting - whether he will overtax as party leader and drive voters away . at school he was extremely successful , gaining entry to the university of edinburgh aged just 16 .

he lacks the charm and camera-friendly nature of former us president bill clinton and his long-standing colleague tony blair . but blair is often accused of being all style and no substance , which is also a charge which the retiring prime minister often levels at the leader of the uk opposition : conservative leader david cameron . brown , on the other hand , has never been part of this new generation of smooth-talking , well-groomed politicians .

brown is deeply religious himself , but also supports secular democracy and hardly ever discusses his religious beliefs . however , his faith does indirectly show its face in his policy decisions .
he is committed to combating world poverty and famed for his charitable endeavors . once , in a critique of european agricultural subsidies , brown famously quipped , " we spend more on cows than the poor . " his altruism is also reflected in a decade of gradually increasing taxation and public spending with brown in control of the purse strings .
critics wonder if he is in fact too charitable and trusting - whether he will overtax as party leader and drive voters away . at school he was extremely successful , gaining entry to the university of edinburgh aged just 16 .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .
" among economists , it 's pretty clear what would happen , " he said .
" the debate on the other side has relatively little to do with economics , it 's a discussion about justice . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at may day rallies , german unions demand minimum wage speaking at the main trade union rally of the day , michael sommer , chairman of the umbrella dgb labor federation , demanded a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- an hour .
-lrb- 01.05.2007 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
" he has brought to europe energy , engagement and ideas and leaves an impressive legacy including his commitment to enlargement , energy policy , his promotion of action against climate change , and for fighting poverty in africa . ”
" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "
merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .
danish pm hails a friend of denmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen appreciated blair 's cooperation prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said that blair had brought their two countries closer together and praised his willingness to cooperate in european and international politics .
" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration . "

" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .

" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .

"
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .

" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration .

our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .

northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .

" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast .

11 , 2001 attacks and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he claims to have been tortured until his release in august 2006 - despite a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's chief of staff thomas de maiziere praised the chancellor 's intervention in the kurnaz case kurnaz was freed after chancellor angela merkel came to power in 2005 and raised the issue of his captivity with us president george bush .
by then , however , the man dubbed " bremen taliban " by the german press , had spent four and a half years languishing in the notorious us camp for terrorist suspects and those designated as " enemy combatants . "
" we made a compromise decision in which the humanitarian aspect took precedent over the security interests , " de maiziere said on thursday after testifying before a parliamentary committee investigating the affair .
the committee is probing whether the previous government - led by social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder - turned down an offer by the us to release kurnaz in 2002 after american officials found he posed no danger , as is claimed by kurnaz .
born in germany # b # de maiziere said that angela merkel 's government intervened on kurnaz ' behalf because he was born and grew up in germany .
" we felt responsible for making the decision we made , " de maiziere said .
de maiziere , who is a member of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , chose not to criticize the former social democrat-green government saying that one could not compare the situation in the immediate aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and circumstances four years later .
schröder 's government has been criticized in germany for not doing enough to help kurnaz get released earlier .
kurnaz is now living in his home city of bremen .
last month he published a memoir which paints a disturbing picture of the time he spent imprisoned in guantanamo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-guantanamo inmate publishes memoir former guantanamo inmate and german-born turkish citizen murat kurnaz has published a harrowing account of the time he spent in the notorious us prison .

he 's now set to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected . james " gordon " brown does n't immediately strike you as a 21st century center-left politician .
he lacks the charm and camera-friendly nature of former us president bill clinton and his long-standing colleague tony blair . but blair is often accused of being all style and no substance , which is also a charge which the retiring prime minister often levels at the leader of the uk opposition : conservative leader david cameron . brown , on the other hand , has never been part of this new generation of smooth-talking , well-groomed politicians .
if anything , with his rumpled suit , rotund physique and unruly thatch of hair , he is probably all substance and no style . uk voters also seem to have noticed this difference in labour 's two foremost politicians . " brown is more old , traditional labour rather than the new trendy blairite labour , " said one voter . " blair 's become very , very slick , " said another .
" whereas gordon brown 's still got the raw roots political blood in him , which you do n't see with blair any more . " the brown biography bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edinburgh , where brown studied brown 's father , john , was a scottish presbyterian minister .
brown is deeply religious himself , but also supports secular democracy and hardly ever discusses his religious beliefs . however , his faith does indirectly show its face in his policy decisions .
he is committed to combating world poverty and famed for his charitable endeavors . once , in a critique of european agricultural subsidies , brown famously quipped , " we spend more on cows than the poor . " his altruism is also reflected in a decade of gradually increasing taxation and public spending with brown in control of the purse strings .
critics wonder if he is in fact too charitable and trusting - whether he will overtax as party leader and drive voters away . at school he was extremely successful , gaining entry to the university of edinburgh aged just 16 .
brown completed a doctorate in history , writing his phd thesis on his beloved labour party .
he also carries one significant scar from his university days : because of a detached retina , possibly from a university rugby match , he is blind in his left eye .
brown will be only the second university-educated prime minister not to have attended either oxford or cambridge , britain 's two premier universities . after brief careers as a lecturer and then a journalist , both while still working in his native scotland , brown turned to politics .
by 1983 he had a seat in british parliament , elected as labour mp for dunfermline east .
his colleagues offer very mixed feedback .
he tends to surround himself with smaller groups of trusted colleagues and shut out others - labour politicians sometimes raise fears that brown will not take advice from all quarters , and may have to struggle to keep the party united . the private man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has played second fiddle long enough brown married his long-time girlfriend sarah macauley in 2000 .
their first child , jennifer jane , was born prematurely and lived only 12 days .
they now have two sons , john aged 3 , and baby james fraser , who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis . but even when talking about his family , brown is famously known to be unable to leave political emphasis and repetition behind ; once saying - " i 'm a father ; that 's what matters most .
nothing matters more . " brown is a huge soccer fan and a life-long supporter of raith rovers soccer club - a lower league side based near his childhood home .
on the soccer pitch , just like in the houses of parliament , brown 's heart seems to lie with the underdog - always putting substance over style . mark hallam -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair announces resignation ; successor to take power in june british prime minister tony blair thursday announced that he will step down after a decade in office , handing over power to a successor on june 27 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 11.05.2007 german minimum wage debate exposes deep left-right divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restaurant and hotel industry is one of the biggest low-wage sectors in germany unlike the us and many other eu countries , germany has no statutory minimum wage , and debate has reignited over introducing one .
one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .

his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
" he has brought to europe energy , engagement and ideas and leaves an impressive legacy including his commitment to enlargement , energy policy , his promotion of action against climate change , and for fighting poverty in africa . ”
" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "
merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .
danish pm hails a friend of denmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen appreciated blair 's cooperation prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said that blair had brought their two countries closer together and praised his willingness to cooperate in european and international politics .
" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration . "
irish leaders join chorus of approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern called blair a friend of ireland special tribute to blair 's " priceless legacy of peace " came from irish prime minister bertie ahern just two days after catholic and protestant political leaders took office in a restored power-sharing government in northern ireland .
" tony blair leaves office with an honored place in our history assured , " ahern said .
" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .
they believe he was too willing to offer concessions to republicans , which may have delayed the progress that has been achieved recently , " he added .
" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "
gerry adams , the sinn fein president added : " tony blair has made a significant and crucial contribution to the irish peace process .

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .

merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .

" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration .

" i think he 's got what it takes to lead the labour party , and indeed the country , with distinction .
he 's an extraordinary and rare talent and it 's tremendous if it is put at the service of the nation , as it now can be . "
" he 's shown , perhaps as the most successful chancellor in our country 's history , that he 's got the strength , the experience and the judgment to make a great prime minister . "
blair , who announced on thursday that he will stand down on june 27 , has until now declined formally to back brown , with whom his relations have long been strained .

" and so i wish him well .
i 'm delighted to support him and endorse him fully . "
brown is almost certain to succeed blair , as he is expected to face just a token challenge from the left wing of the center-left labour party .

" i think the relationship will be very close , in part because britain and the united states are such key allies , " rice told bbc radio .
" the bonds with prime minister blair have been forged through some of the most difficult times , through the time of 9/11 , through the time of the attacks on london , through afghanistan and iraq and northern ireland and those are bonds of friendship that come from having been through some of the toughest circumstances .

he was criticized for his role in the iraq war , but also lauded for what he 'd achieved at home and in his own party . tony blair announced on thursday that he would step down on june 27 , after 10 years as britain 's prime minister . london 's the independent , called blair 's role in the iraq war " his tragic epitaph . "
" its repercussions will be felt for many years to come , " wrote the daily . the financial times commented from the british capital that " iraq has also done great damage to the doctrine of liberal interventionism mr blair eloquently set out in his 1999 speech in chicago , and honorably defended in sierra leone , kosovo and afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is blair just " bush 's faithful poodle ? "
on the european mainland , the prime minister 's cooperation with us president bush in the iraq war was also a point of contention .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung in southern germany described blair 's image as " bush 's faithful poodle . " " large portions of the public see the man who is now leaving downing street merely as a laughing stock or a liar who twisted the facts in order to justify the war , " commented the paper .
" it 's tony blair 's own fault that the britons are now relieved that he 's resigning , although they owe him a lot . " strengths on the domestic front blair was also praised for the developments he had achieved at home . " he managed to make great britain into a country that can look into the future with confidence , " wrote de volkskrant from the hague .
" time will tell if this aspect of his term in office - which also includes his involvement in africa and in climate policy - can offset the effects of the war in iraq . " paris ' liberation conceded that blair " is leaving behind a balance sheet full of contrasts , " but added that his achievements outweigh what 's been done in france . " there are more billionaires in britain than before , but also much less poverty , " the daily wrote .
" it 's easy to find a job on the well functioning job market ...
no british government had ever invested so much in the public sector , especially in education .

" tony blair modernized his own party and spared the economic success that margaret thatcher had brought the country through her reforms , " the paper said . a stronger labour party der tagesspiegel in berlin agreed that the prime minister had had a huge influence on his party : " tony blair made the labour party electable .
he brought it into the center of society and established it there .
that 's an impressive accomplishment . " though british finance minister gordon brown was set to move into 10 downing street next , der tagesspiegel had another candidate in mind . " now a party is pushing -lrb- blair -rrb- out of office that thinks it 'll have better chances in the election with gordon brown , " wrote the paper .
" labour just might be fooling themselves .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .

he 's now set to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected . james " gordon " brown does n't immediately strike you as a 21st century center-left politician .
he lacks the charm and camera-friendly nature of former us president bill clinton and his long-standing colleague tony blair . but blair is often accused of being all style and no substance , which is also a charge which the retiring prime minister often levels at the leader of the uk opposition : conservative leader david cameron . brown , on the other hand , has never been part of this new generation of smooth-talking , well-groomed politicians .
if anything , with his rumpled suit , rotund physique and unruly thatch of hair , he is probably all substance and no style . uk voters also seem to have noticed this difference in labour 's two foremost politicians . " brown is more old , traditional labour rather than the new trendy blairite labour , " said one voter . " blair 's become very , very slick , " said another .
" whereas gordon brown 's still got the raw roots political blood in him , which you do n't see with blair any more . " the brown biography bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edinburgh , where brown studied brown 's father , john , was a scottish presbyterian minister .
brown is deeply religious himself , but also supports secular democracy and hardly ever discusses his religious beliefs . however , his faith does indirectly show its face in his policy decisions .
he is committed to combating world poverty and famed for his charitable endeavors . once , in a critique of european agricultural subsidies , brown famously quipped , " we spend more on cows than the poor . " his altruism is also reflected in a decade of gradually increasing taxation and public spending with brown in control of the purse strings .
critics wonder if he is in fact too charitable and trusting - whether he will overtax as party leader and drive voters away . at school he was extremely successful , gaining entry to the university of edinburgh aged just 16 .
brown completed a doctorate in history , writing his phd thesis on his beloved labour party .
he also carries one significant scar from his university days : because of a detached retina , possibly from a university rugby match , he is blind in his left eye .
brown will be only the second university-educated prime minister not to have attended either oxford or cambridge , britain 's two premier universities . after brief careers as a lecturer and then a journalist , both while still working in his native scotland , brown turned to politics .
by 1983 he had a seat in british parliament , elected as labour mp for dunfermline east .
his colleagues offer very mixed feedback .
he tends to surround himself with smaller groups of trusted colleagues and shut out others - labour politicians sometimes raise fears that brown will not take advice from all quarters , and may have to struggle to keep the party united . the private man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has played second fiddle long enough brown married his long-time girlfriend sarah macauley in 2000 .
their first child , jennifer jane , was born prematurely and lived only 12 days .
they now have two sons , john aged 3 , and baby james fraser , who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis . but even when talking about his family , brown is famously known to be unable to leave political emphasis and repetition behind ; once saying - " i 'm a father ; that 's what matters most .
nothing matters more . " brown is a huge soccer fan and a life-long supporter of raith rovers soccer club - a lower league side based near his childhood home .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .

" " i 'm absolutely delighted to give my full support to gordon as the next leader of the labour party and prime minister and to endorse him fully , " blair told reporters .
" i think he 's got what it takes to lead the labour party , and indeed the country , with distinction .
he 's an extraordinary and rare talent and it 's tremendous if it is put at the service of the nation , as it now can be . "
" he 's shown , perhaps as the most successful chancellor in our country 's history , that he 's got the strength , the experience and the judgment to make a great prime minister . "
blair , who announced on thursday that he will stand down on june 27 , has until now declined formally to back brown , with whom his relations have long been strained .
blair says brown can make a difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown finally gets his chance to take the reins on friday he said of brown : " i know he 's absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade . "
" i also believe , as someone who 's known him for over 20 years as a friend and a colleague , that he can make a real difference to this country , for the better and for the good . "
" and so i wish him well .
i 'm delighted to support him and endorse him fully . "
brown is almost certain to succeed blair , as he is expected to face just a token challenge from the left wing of the center-left labour party .
brown has already received assurances from the united states , britain ’ s main ally , that the " special relationship " will continue if he becomes prime minister .
rice gives brown us assurance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will be greeted by a new pm when she next visits no. 10 us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday that washington would continue to work extremely closely with london under brown .
hailing blair as a tremendous visionary , she said the partnership between britain and the united states would endure under his successor .
" i think the relationship will be very close , in part because britain and the united states are such key allies , " rice told bbc radio .
" the bonds with prime minister blair have been forged through some of the most difficult times , through the time of 9/11 , through the time of the attacks on london , through afghanistan and iraq and northern ireland and those are bonds of friendship that come from having been through some of the toughest circumstances .

" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "

she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .

" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration .

miriam gruss , a parliamentarian from the opposition free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- added that the government just did n't want to realize that growing xenophobia was posing a huge threat to society at large .
" every fourth german harbors anti-foreigner sentiments , " said gruss .
" right-wing extremism is clearly rooted in the middle of society , it 's not a minor phenomenon .
" xenophobia in particular can be found in all parts of germany and among people of all age groups and educational backgrounds , " she said .

he pointed out that the german parliament allocates 19 million euros annually to bring back into the mainstream young people who 've left the straight and narrow path .
" a special program called ' youth for democracy and tolerance ' was started in january of this year , " bergner said .
we hope it -lrb- the program -rrb- will have the desired effect . "
incident in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd represents extreme right-wing views the most recent bundestag debate about xenophobia was overshadowed by an incident in saxony 's regional parliament where a politician of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- used a a debate about immigration and asylum to hurl a string of racist insults .
among other tasteless comments , npd lawmaker holger apfel " this multi-coloured germany is an outrageous injustice " and that german politicians should finally realize that " arrogant black people , tartar tribesmen and state-subsidized oriental mega-families " could never be integrated into german society .
his speech in the parliament first went uncommented .

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
" he has brought to europe energy , engagement and ideas and leaves an impressive legacy including his commitment to enlargement , energy policy , his promotion of action against climate change , and for fighting poverty in africa . ”
" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "
merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .
danish pm hails a friend of denmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen appreciated blair 's cooperation prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said that blair had brought their two countries closer together and praised his willingness to cooperate in european and international politics .
" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration .

" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .
they believe he was too willing to offer concessions to republicans , which may have delayed the progress that has been achieved recently , " he added .
" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "

" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration . "
irish leaders join chorus of approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern called blair a friend of ireland special tribute to blair 's " priceless legacy of peace " came from irish prime minister bertie ahern just two days after catholic and protestant political leaders took office in a restored power-sharing government in northern ireland .
" tony blair leaves office with an honored place in our history assured , " ahern said .
" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .
they believe he was too willing to offer concessions to republicans , which may have delayed the progress that has been achieved recently , " he added .
" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "
gerry adams , the sinn fein president added : " tony blair has made a significant and crucial contribution to the irish peace process .
the good friday agreement and the restoration of the political institutions would not have been possible without him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 11.05.2007 german minimum wage debate exposes deep left-right divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restaurant and hotel industry is one of the biggest low-wage sectors in germany unlike the us and many other eu countries , germany has no statutory minimum wage , and debate has reignited over introducing one .
one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .

he 's now set to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected . james " gordon " brown does n't immediately strike you as a 21st century center-left politician .
he lacks the charm and camera-friendly nature of former us president bill clinton and his long-standing colleague tony blair . but blair is often accused of being all style and no substance , which is also a charge which the retiring prime minister often levels at the leader of the uk opposition : conservative leader david cameron . brown , on the other hand , has never been part of this new generation of smooth-talking , well-groomed politicians .
if anything , with his rumpled suit , rotund physique and unruly thatch of hair , he is probably all substance and no style . uk voters also seem to have noticed this difference in labour 's two foremost politicians . " brown is more old , traditional labour rather than the new trendy blairite labour , " said one voter . " blair 's become very , very slick , " said another .
" whereas gordon brown 's still got the raw roots political blood in him , which you do n't see with blair any more . " the brown biography bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edinburgh , where brown studied brown 's father , john , was a scottish presbyterian minister .
brown is deeply religious himself , but also supports secular democracy and hardly ever discusses his religious beliefs . however , his faith does indirectly show its face in his policy decisions .
he is committed to combating world poverty and famed for his charitable endeavors . once , in a critique of european agricultural subsidies , brown famously quipped , " we spend more on cows than the poor . " his altruism is also reflected in a decade of gradually increasing taxation and public spending with brown in control of the purse strings .
critics wonder if he is in fact too charitable and trusting - whether he will overtax as party leader and drive voters away . at school he was extremely successful , gaining entry to the university of edinburgh aged just 16 .
brown completed a doctorate in history , writing his phd thesis on his beloved labour party .
he also carries one significant scar from his university days : because of a detached retina , possibly from a university rugby match , he is blind in his left eye .
brown will be only the second university-educated prime minister not to have attended either oxford or cambridge , britain 's two premier universities . after brief careers as a lecturer and then a journalist , both while still working in his native scotland , brown turned to politics .
by 1983 he had a seat in british parliament , elected as labour mp for dunfermline east .

he 's now set to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected . james " gordon " brown does n't immediately strike you as a 21st century center-left politician .
he lacks the charm and camera-friendly nature of former us president bill clinton and his long-standing colleague tony blair . but blair is often accused of being all style and no substance , which is also a charge which the retiring prime minister often levels at the leader of the uk opposition : conservative leader david cameron . brown , on the other hand , has never been part of this new generation of smooth-talking , well-groomed politicians .
if anything , with his rumpled suit , rotund physique and unruly thatch of hair , he is probably all substance and no style . uk voters also seem to have noticed this difference in labour 's two foremost politicians . " brown is more old , traditional labour rather than the new trendy blairite labour , " said one voter . " blair 's become very , very slick , " said another .
" whereas gordon brown 's still got the raw roots political blood in him , which you do n't see with blair any more . " the brown biography bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edinburgh , where brown studied brown 's father , john , was a scottish presbyterian minister .
brown is deeply religious himself , but also supports secular democracy and hardly ever discusses his religious beliefs . however , his faith does indirectly show its face in his policy decisions .
he is committed to combating world poverty and famed for his charitable endeavors . once , in a critique of european agricultural subsidies , brown famously quipped , " we spend more on cows than the poor . " his altruism is also reflected in a decade of gradually increasing taxation and public spending with brown in control of the purse strings .
critics wonder if he is in fact too charitable and trusting - whether he will overtax as party leader and drive voters away . at school he was extremely successful , gaining entry to the university of edinburgh aged just 16 .
brown completed a doctorate in history , writing his phd thesis on his beloved labour party .
he also carries one significant scar from his university days : because of a detached retina , possibly from a university rugby match , he is blind in his left eye .
brown will be only the second university-educated prime minister not to have attended either oxford or cambridge , britain 's two premier universities . after brief careers as a lecturer and then a journalist , both while still working in his native scotland , brown turned to politics .
by 1983 he had a seat in british parliament , elected as labour mp for dunfermline east .
his colleagues offer very mixed feedback .
he tends to surround himself with smaller groups of trusted colleagues and shut out others - labour politicians sometimes raise fears that brown will not take advice from all quarters , and may have to struggle to keep the party united . the private man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has played second fiddle long enough brown married his long-time girlfriend sarah macauley in 2000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 11.05.2007 german minimum wage debate exposes deep left-right divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restaurant and hotel industry is one of the biggest low-wage sectors in germany unlike the us and many other eu countries , germany has no statutory minimum wage , and debate has reignited over introducing one .
one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .
" among economists , it 's pretty clear what would happen , " he said .
" the debate on the other side has relatively little to do with economics , it 's a discussion about justice . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at may day rallies , german unions demand minimum wage speaking at the main trade union rally of the day , michael sommer , chairman of the umbrella dgb labor federation , demanded a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- an hour .
-lrb- 01.05.2007 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .

he 's now set to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected . james " gordon " brown does n't immediately strike you as a 21st century center-left politician .
he lacks the charm and camera-friendly nature of former us president bill clinton and his long-standing colleague tony blair . but blair is often accused of being all style and no substance , which is also a charge which the retiring prime minister often levels at the leader of the uk opposition : conservative leader david cameron . brown , on the other hand , has never been part of this new generation of smooth-talking , well-groomed politicians .
if anything , with his rumpled suit , rotund physique and unruly thatch of hair , he is probably all substance and no style . uk voters also seem to have noticed this difference in labour 's two foremost politicians . " brown is more old , traditional labour rather than the new trendy blairite labour , " said one voter . " blair 's become very , very slick , " said another .
" whereas gordon brown 's still got the raw roots political blood in him , which you do n't see with blair any more . " the brown biography bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edinburgh , where brown studied brown 's father , john , was a scottish presbyterian minister .
brown is deeply religious himself , but also supports secular democracy and hardly ever discusses his religious beliefs . however , his faith does indirectly show its face in his policy decisions .
he is committed to combating world poverty and famed for his charitable endeavors . once , in a critique of european agricultural subsidies , brown famously quipped , " we spend more on cows than the poor . " his altruism is also reflected in a decade of gradually increasing taxation and public spending with brown in control of the purse strings .
critics wonder if he is in fact too charitable and trusting - whether he will overtax as party leader and drive voters away . at school he was extremely successful , gaining entry to the university of edinburgh aged just 16 .
brown completed a doctorate in history , writing his phd thesis on his beloved labour party .
he also carries one significant scar from his university days : because of a detached retina , possibly from a university rugby match , he is blind in his left eye .
brown will be only the second university-educated prime minister not to have attended either oxford or cambridge , britain 's two premier universities . after brief careers as a lecturer and then a journalist , both while still working in his native scotland , brown turned to politics .
by 1983 he had a seat in british parliament , elected as labour mp for dunfermline east .
his colleagues offer very mixed feedback .
he tends to surround himself with smaller groups of trusted colleagues and shut out others - labour politicians sometimes raise fears that brown will not take advice from all quarters , and may have to struggle to keep the party united . the private man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has played second fiddle long enough brown married his long-time girlfriend sarah macauley in 2000 .
their first child , jennifer jane , was born prematurely and lived only 12 days .
they now have two sons , john aged 3 , and baby james fraser , who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis . but even when talking about his family , brown is famously known to be unable to leave political emphasis and repetition behind ; once saying - " i 'm a father ; that 's what matters most .
nothing matters more . " brown is a huge soccer fan and a life-long supporter of raith rovers soccer club - a lower league side based near his childhood home .
on the soccer pitch , just like in the houses of parliament , brown 's heart seems to lie with the underdog - always putting substance over style . mark hallam -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair announces resignation ; successor to take power in june british prime minister tony blair thursday announced that he will step down after a decade in office , handing over power to a successor on june 27 .

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
" he has brought to europe energy , engagement and ideas and leaves an impressive legacy including his commitment to enlargement , energy policy , his promotion of action against climate change , and for fighting poverty in africa . ”
" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "
merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .
danish pm hails a friend of denmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen appreciated blair 's cooperation prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said that blair had brought their two countries closer together and praised his willingness to cooperate in european and international politics .
" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration . "
irish leaders join chorus of approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern called blair a friend of ireland special tribute to blair 's " priceless legacy of peace " came from irish prime minister bertie ahern just two days after catholic and protestant political leaders took office in a restored power-sharing government in northern ireland .
" tony blair leaves office with an honored place in our history assured , " ahern said .
" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .
they believe he was too willing to offer concessions to republicans , which may have delayed the progress that has been achieved recently , " he added .
" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "
gerry adams , the sinn fein president added : " tony blair has made a significant and crucial contribution to the irish peace process .

" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
" he has brought to europe energy , engagement and ideas and leaves an impressive legacy including his commitment to enlargement , energy policy , his promotion of action against climate change , and for fighting poverty in africa . ”
" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "
merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .
danish pm hails a friend of denmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen appreciated blair 's cooperation prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said that blair had brought their two countries closer together and praised his willingness to cooperate in european and international politics .
" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration .

our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .
" among economists , it 's pretty clear what would happen , " he said .

" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 11.05.2007 german minimum wage debate exposes deep left-right divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restaurant and hotel industry is one of the biggest low-wage sectors in germany unlike the us and many other eu countries , germany has no statutory minimum wage , and debate has reignited over introducing one .
one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .
" among economists , it 's pretty clear what would happen , " he said .
" the debate on the other side has relatively little to do with economics , it 's a discussion about justice . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at may day rallies , german unions demand minimum wage speaking at the main trade union rally of the day , michael sommer , chairman of the umbrella dgb labor federation , demanded a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- an hour .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .

german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .

no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .

but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .

one side says it 's about social justice ; the other calls it a job killer . to some , it might seem that the jobs held by those uniformed individuals keeping watch at a company entrance are to be envied .
they do n't seem to involve much stress and leave a good amount of time for magazine reading .
but the envy would likely stop when the pay stub arrived .
security firm jobs might often be low key , but they usually also involve very low pay .
in eastern germany , security personnel can receive hourly wages as low as 3.70 euros -lrb- $ 5.02 -rrb- .
that kind of pay is what michael sommer , the head of germany 's dgb trade union federation , referred to when he addressed trade unionists on may 1 and talked about millions of german workers in the restaurant and hotel industry among others eking out a living on " starvation wages . "
he demanded that germany introduce a statutory minimum wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
his call has been taken up by others on the left side of the political spectrum , and reignited a debate over whether germany , now enjoying healthy economic growth , should follow the lead of 18 of the eu 's 27 member states and introduce a comprehensive minimum wage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , berlin agreed to introduce a minimum wage for the cleaning industry but on the conservative side of the political divide and among employers ' groups , a minimum wage is being called a job killer .
they say regional and sector differences make a national minimum wage unfeasible since it would make labor too expensive .
" a minimum wage enshrined in law will destroy tens of thousands of jobs and promote illegal work , " said ingrid hartges , managing director of dehoga , germany 's hotel and catering industry association , in a statement .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out against a minimum wage , saying she preferred to have collective bargaining practices strengthened instead .
different approach in the united states , a 16-year-old getting a job flipping burgers or running a cash register can be assured a certain , admittedly low , level of income due to the federal minimum wage law .
in germany , the system works differently .
traditionally , wages in germany are set according to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements and detailed rules determine what kind of work receives what kind of pay .
because of the strength of trade unions in germany , wage settlements were generally pretty favorable to workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bakeries fall into the low-wage category while the american minimum wage , which dates from 1938 , was put in place to keep employers from exploiting workers and giving them an income on which they could survive , germany 's generous social welfare system provided that protection .
no one would work for wages that were under a certain level , because welfare benefits could give them a basic income .
" that has acted as a kind of virtual minimum wage , " said joachim ragnatz , an economist at the halle institute for economic research .
but more and more holes have developed in that system .
welfare benefits have been cut back .
unions have lost clout and some sectors , especially in the service industry , have opted out of collective bargaining agreements .
" that means they do more or less what they want when it comes to setting wages , " said cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the ver.di services union . without a minimum wage , she says , the downward pressure on wages keeps increasing .
" we need a minimum wage to provide a flank for our collective bargaining policy , " she said study : jobs will be lost but conservatives just got some economic evidence to back up their opposition .
a study just released by ragnatz and marcel thum from the ifo institute for economic research says increasing the minimum wage to 6.50 euros per hour , as the social democrats have called for , would result in a loss of around 465,000 jobs .
raising it to 7.50 euros would kill around 621,000 jobs , according to the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hairstylists often have to struggle to make ends meet eastern germany , still structurally weak but slowly recovering , would be especially hard hit , the authors say , because more people are employed in the low-wage sector there .
" the study proves what we have long warned about , " said saxony 's conservative premier george milbradt .
" the minimum wage would abruptly put the breaks on a job motor that 's humming along . "
hass from the ver.di union calls that " nonsense , total nonsense , " and points to the example of the united kingdom , whose economy was not harmed by the introduction of a minimum wage in 1999 .
but according to study author ragnatz , most economists do agree that a minimum wage in germany would result in job losses , and many advocate other models , such as having low wages topped up by the government .
he said the pro and con arguments around the minimum wage are coming from two different places .
" among economists , it 's pretty clear what would happen , " he said .
" the debate on the other side has relatively little to do with economics , it 's a discussion about justice .

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .

" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "
merkel speaks of mutual trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke of relying on blair 's advice on hot topics german chancellor angela merkel said she had learned with regret of blair 's decision to step down , saying in a statement they had enjoyed " great mutual trust on all international and european issues . "
" chancellor merkel and tony blair have worked together very closely and with great mutual trust on all international and european issues , " merkel 's chancellery statement said .
" she looks forward to continuing their cooperation to meet the challenges that lie ahead at the upcoming g8 summit and the european council meeting and knows that she can rely on prime minister blair 's advice . "
the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .
" tony blair was a leader with a capital l , not a politician who looks at opinion polls first and decides what he is going to do but a leader who leads and i think for me that is the most important feature i could mention about tony blair . "
" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .
danish pm hails a friend of denmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen appreciated blair 's cooperation prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said that blair had brought their two countries closer together and praised his willingness to cooperate in european and international politics .
" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration . "
irish leaders join chorus of approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern called blair a friend of ireland special tribute to blair 's " priceless legacy of peace " came from irish prime minister bertie ahern just two days after catholic and protestant political leaders took office in a restored power-sharing government in northern ireland .
" tony blair leaves office with an honored place in our history assured , " ahern said .
" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .
they believe he was too willing to offer concessions to republicans , which may have delayed the progress that has been achieved recently , " he added .
" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "
gerry adams , the sinn fein president added : " tony blair has made a significant and crucial contribution to the irish peace process .

" britain has been under tony blair 's leadership one of denmark 's closest international partners ... working together in the eu or in international operations in the balkans , iraq and afghanistan , " he said .
finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration .

our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .

northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .

finnish president tarja halonen hailed blair 's role in strengthening europe 's ties with the united states .
" as is tradition in his country , he maintained close ties with the united states and in doing so strengthened europe 's transatlantic relationship , " halonen said in a statement .
she made no mention of blair 's decision to involve britain in the us-led war in iraq , which finland opposed due to the lack of a un mandate .
blair also " increased britain 's involvement in european integration and made britain an active member of the european union , " she said .
hungary 's socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany praised blair ’ s domestic record as a left-wing leader .
" he greatly contributed to the transformation of britain , that britain today is again competitive , a country with a significant influence , and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the british left , " he said .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt called blair a " jovial , easygoing person " and a " fantastic speaker , " but said the iraq war led to blair 's eventual demise and that his decision to join the 2003 invasion was likely influenced by the notion that " every british prime minister has a historical duty to be very close to the american administration . "

" tony blair leaves office with an honored place in our history assured , " ahern said .
" tony blair leaves a priceless legacy of peace and agreement in ireland .
our two governments forged an unprecedented partnership that made a real difference and achieved a transformation in the relationship between britain and ireland , " ahern continued .
" he has been a friend to ireland .
and i am proud also to count him as a friend of mine . "
northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who was sworn in as part of an historic power sharing agreement with republican sinn fein , said : " there were many issues on which we did not see eye to eye and indeed he kept me out of downing street for several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ian paisley did n't always see eye-to-eye with blair " also unionists do not forget his failure to live up to promises in the early years .

" there is no doubt , however , that the prime minister 's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in northern ireland . "

he 's a long-term thinker . "
" i have found him to be a man who 's kept his word , " bush said , adding he counted blair as a friend .
" when tony blair tells you something , as we say in texas , you can take it to the bank . "
european leaders focused on blair 's legacy to the unity of the european union , although analysts in brussels suggested he could perhaps have done more , and eu officials agreed that euro-skepticism remained strong in britain .
" tony blair has taken britain from the fringes to the mainstream of the european union .
he has done this by engagement , not by vetoes , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
" he has brought to europe energy , engagement and ideas and leaves an impressive legacy including his commitment to enlargement , energy policy , his promotion of action against climate change , and for fighting poverty in africa . ”
" above all he has shared in our determination to create an open , reforming and strong europe .
i greatly value our friendship and i wish him success for the future , " he said .
but in a separate statement barroso acknowledged : " i have to say ... that in britain , honestly , the debate for europe is not yet won . "

the chancellery said merkel was confident that berlin and london will continue to enjoy good relations after blair 's departure on june 27 after a decade in power .
nato chief praises blair 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer called blair a leader who leads nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said that blair ’ s commitment to causes he believed in made him stand out on the global stage .

" despite resistance he thought this was the right course for great britain and he did , ” the nato chief continued .
" we all know that iraq caused a split in the security council and the european union and nato but , right or wrong , this was tony blair thinking that this was the way . "
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country held the rotating eu presidency in 2004 , said he would miss blair , adding that " a significant political figure is leaving the european and world stage . "
" at times of tension , blair was a force for unity , " balkenende said , referring to the bomb attacks in london in july 2005 and the death of princess diana in 1997 .

on the european mainland , the prime minister 's cooperation with us president bush in the iraq war was also a point of contention .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung in southern germany described blair 's image as " bush 's faithful poodle . " " large portions of the public see the man who is now leaving downing street merely as a laughing stock or a liar who twisted the facts in order to justify the war , " commented the paper .
" it 's tony blair 's own fault that the britons are now relieved that he 's resigning , although they owe him a lot . " strengths on the domestic front blair was also praised for the developments he had achieved at home . " he managed to make great britain into a country that can look into the future with confidence , " wrote de volkskrant from the hague .
" time will tell if this aspect of his term in office - which also includes his involvement in africa and in climate policy - can offset the effects of the war in iraq . " paris ' liberation conceded that blair " is leaving behind a balance sheet full of contrasts , " but added that his achievements outweigh what 's been done in france . " there are more billionaires in britain than before , but also much less poverty , " the daily wrote .
" it 's easy to find a job on the well functioning job market ...

he brought it into the center of society and established it there .
that 's an impressive accomplishment . " though british finance minister gordon brown was set to move into 10 downing street next , der tagesspiegel had another candidate in mind . " now a party is pushing -lrb- blair -rrb- out of office that thinks it 'll have better chances in the election with gordon brown , " wrote the paper .

" regional police authorities are considering taking recourse to so-called preventative detention , " schäuble told germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government had threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks in efforts to quell violent protests at the june 6-8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
reintroduction of border checks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants extended powers to tackle extremists normally german borders are open and passengers on flights from many european union countries , the so-called schengen nations , do not need to show passports .
the interior ministry said it needed to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
berlin is expecting up to 100,000 protestors to target the g8 summit in the baltic sea resort .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock the authorities are building a 12-kilometer-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence to protect the leaders attending the event .
police raids prompt anger on wednesday , police launched a crackdown against left-wing extremists they believed were intent on disrupting the talks between leaders from germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , the united states and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were violent responses to the police raids the authorities searched 40 sites throughout northern germany linked to 18 suspects thought to belong to a far-left group that was preparing arson attacks and other violent protests against the summit .
the prosecutor 's office in the south-western city of karlsruhe said nearly 900 police officers had taken part in the raids , which also targeted three suspects believed to belong to a radical group known as " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- that is suspected of being behind 25 attacks since 2001 .
" the suspects linked to the militant , left-wing extremist scene are accused of founding or belonging to a terrorist organization whose aim is to disrupt or prevent the upcoming g8 world economic summit taking place in early summer 2007 , " the office said in a statement .
crackdown mobilizes left-wing protestors anti-globalization group attac slammed the raids as " an attempt to criminalize the entire spectrum of g8 opponents . "
the group claims that the police offensive has been counterproductive in terms of security and says even more activists are expected in cities such as rostock , near the g8 summit location of heiligendamm .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television friday .
" we have received a lot of e-mails from people saying ' at first i did not want to go to rostock ... but now i am ready , " ' he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac expects the raids to inspire more to protest fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast .

the bull , called shambo , lives at the skanda vale temple in llanpumsaint , carmarthenshire , but tested positive for bovine tb after routine screening .
nearly 4,000 people have signed an online petition to save shambo .
but the british cattle veterinary association -lrb- bcva -rrb- said any risk of the disease spreading was " unacceptable " .
skanda vale temple , known as the community of the many names of god , is a multi-denominational monastic centre , which embraces all religious faiths and includes three hindu shrines .
monks at the temple have said they plan to form a human chain to prevent the animal being taken away for destruction and some hindu groups have backed the campaign . "
there is a responsibility of the keepers of this animal to comply with the legislation " graham brooks , british cattle veterinary association veterinary officials are scheduled to slaughter shambo by 21 may after the monks were given notification on 5 may .
the final decision on the british friesian bull 's fate rests with the welsh assembly government .
an assembly spokeswoman said measures to control tb are in place " to protect both human and animal health " but added that " every effort will be made to deal with this case as sensitively as possible " .
members of the temple said on thursday they were instructing their lawyers to seek an injunction to stop shambo 's slaughter .
' risk of transmission ' but the bcva , which is the cattle specialist division of the british veterinary association , said the bull needed to be destroyed .
its president , graham brooks , said : " to achieve effective control those animals testing positive -lsb- for tb -rsb- must be removed from the cattle population .
" if this is not done , there is a risk of transmission to other cattle and those humans in contact with the animal and its excrement and bedding .
" there is a wider responsibility to ensure this disease does not spread to other species which could create a reservoir of local infection .
" the risks of this happening to the surrounding wildlife and cattle populations are unacceptable . "
he added : " there is a responsibility of the keepers of this animal to comply with the legislation surrounding this disease to ensure we achieve adequate control in the national herd . "
the monks at the temple have said they regard the bull 's life as sacred and as important as that of a human .
maya warrier , a lecturer in religious studies at the university of wales , lampeter , said reverence of the cow was important in the religious beliefs of many hindus .
she said : " it goes back a long way to the aryans in india in about 1500 bc .
" they were a pastoral , cattle-rearing community - the cow had a high economic value and having a lot of cows symbolised prosperity .
" more recently , the god krishna is one of the most popular gods in contemporary hinduism and he is also portrayed as a pastoral figure .
" the status of the cow has been a subject of debate throughout hinduism and some communities eat beef , but it 's true to say many hindus regard cows as sacred . "

its president , graham brooks , said : " to achieve effective control those animals testing positive -lsb- for tb -rsb- must be removed from the cattle population .
" if this is not done , there is a risk of transmission to other cattle and those humans in contact with the animal and its excrement and bedding .
" there is a wider responsibility to ensure this disease does not spread to other species which could create a reservoir of local infection .
shambo is scheduled to be slaughtered by 21 may " the risks of this happening to the surrounding wildlife and cattle populations are unacceptable . "
he added : " there is a responsibility of the keepers of this animal to comply with the legislation surrounding this disease to ensure we achieve adequate control in the national herd . "
the monks at the temple have said they regard the bull 's life as sacred and as important as that of a human .
maya warrier , a lecturer in religious studies at the university of wales , lampeter , said reverence of the cow was important in the religious beliefs of many hindus .
she said : " it goes back a long way to the aryans in india in about 1500 bc .
" they were a pastoral , cattle-rearing community - the cow had a high economic value and having a lot of cows symbolised prosperity .
" more recently , the god krishna is one of the most popular gods in contemporary hinduism and he is also portrayed as a pastoral figure .
" the status of the cow has been a subject of debate throughout hinduism and some communities eat beef , but it 's true to say many hindus regard cows as sacred . "

dartington -lrb- dca -rrb- , which was created in 1961 by the dartington hall trust , does not own its premises and has always relied heavily on its landlord , the trust , for capital spending .
the trust -lrb- dht -rrb- has said it can not afford the £ 20m needed to modernise the college facilities .
that has led to the college seeking to merge with university college falmouth -lrb- ucf -rrb- and create a new specialist university of the arts in cornwall .
but the lack of money to fund the move and the call for eu convergence funds which are only available in cornwall has made it controversial .
a report by jm consulting for the dht this year said : " dartington is in the unique position of needing to relocate but having no ability to make a significant financial contribution to the capital costs of this relocation . "
convergence funding replaces objective one for regions under 75 % of eu average gdp £ 440m , from european regional development fund , match funded by public sector and £ 130m from european social fund runs from 2007 to 2013 covers cornwall and isles of scilly administrators : south west regional development agency it said the financing of this option would potentially be supported through eu convergence funds , which would have to be matched by other sources .
the consultants proposed a financing package made from higher education funding council for england -lrb- hefce -rrb- capital grants , convergence funding which is distributed by the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- , contributions from ucf and dca , as well as borrowing , efficiency savings , fundraising and sponsorship .
but they warned : " there is an element of uncertainty associated with the eu funding . "
professor alan livingston , principal of ucf , said he was confident hefce , which funds about 70 % of dartington 's running costs , and the rda , would help fund the merger .
fight ahead " a merged institution will be a major contributor to the economic and cultural future of cornwall , " he said .
" the rda , i know , is really aware of the potential impact that will have on the regeneration of cornwall . "
we have the chance to make something of truly international significance professor alan livingston falmouth specialises in art , design and media , while dartington would bring dance , drama and music .
he said : " i think the logic is overwhelming .
" we have the chance to make something of truly international significance . "
jill sheen , higher education development manager at the rda , said dartington and falmouth would have to " fight their corner " .
she said : " you can not use public money to move it from one place to another .
" we have to consider the downside too , what is going to happen to south devon .
" the net impact could be zero in which case we would not do it . "
we have to take a fairly hard-nosed view of it jill sheen , rda she said the eu was expecting tangible results from convergence funding after six years of objective one funding ended last year .
" we have to take a fairly hard-nosed view of it .
" the eu is looking for something transformational .
" this is the last chance cornwall will have for funding on this sort of scale .
it has to work . "
a report for the rda and hefce by consultants burns owens in march said moving to falmouth was a better option than plymouth and torbay , which were also considered .
dartington hall trust has plans to make up the estimated £ 4.7m loss to the south devon economy from the loss of the college of arts .
ideas include an arts park to " incubate and support creative enterprises " and the doubling in size of the schumacher college , an environmental studies college at dartington .
both institutions are hoping for a legal agreement on the move to falmouth by late summer , agreement on funding by the autumn , and if there are no hitches , dartington could open in falmouth in september 2010 .

he said it was correct that european funds should be used to help fund the move .
" convergence money is not available in devon because that is the way european funding works , " he said .
" it can only be spent in cornwall .
" it can not be spent on relocation per se , but it can fund economic activity and if we have an internationally successful arts institution in cornwall with all that dartington can bring , it would have an economic benefit to the area . "

dartington -lrb- dca -rrb- , which was created in 1961 by the dartington hall trust , does not own its premises and has always relied heavily on its landlord , the trust , for capital spending .
the trust -lrb- dht -rrb- has said it can not afford the £ 20m needed to modernise the college facilities .
that has led to the college seeking to merge with university college falmouth -lrb- ucf -rrb- and create a new specialist university of the arts in cornwall .
but the lack of money to fund the move and the call for eu convergence funds which are only available in cornwall has made it controversial .
a report by jm consulting for the dht this year said : " dartington is in the unique position of needing to relocate but having no ability to make a significant financial contribution to the capital costs of this relocation . "
convergence funding replaces objective one for regions under 75 % of eu average gdp £ 440m , from european regional development fund , match funded by public sector and £ 130m from european social fund runs from 2007 to 2013 covers cornwall and isles of scilly administrators : south west regional development agency it said the financing of this option would potentially be supported through eu convergence funds , which would have to be matched by other sources .

but they warned : " there is an element of uncertainty associated with the eu funding . "
professor alan livingston , principal of ucf , said he was confident hefce , which funds about 70 % of dartington 's running costs , and the rda , would help fund the merger .
fight ahead " a merged institution will be a major contributor to the economic and cultural future of cornwall , " he said .
" the rda , i know , is really aware of the potential impact that will have on the regeneration of cornwall . "

jill sheen , higher education development manager at the rda , said dartington and falmouth would have to " fight their corner " .
she said : " you can not use public money to move it from one place to another .
" we have to consider the downside too , what is going to happen to south devon .

that has led to the college seeking to merge with university college falmouth -lrb- ucf -rrb- and create a new specialist university of the arts in cornwall .
but the lack of money to fund the move and the call for eu convergence funds which are only available in cornwall has made it controversial .
a report by jm consulting for the dht this year said : " dartington is in the unique position of needing to relocate but having no ability to make a significant financial contribution to the capital costs of this relocation . "
convergence funding replaces objective one for regions under 75 % of eu average gdp £ 440m , from european regional development fund , match funded by public sector and £ 130m from european social fund runs from 2007 to 2013 covers cornwall and isles of scilly administrators : south west regional development agency it said the financing of this option would potentially be supported through eu convergence funds , which would have to be matched by other sources .
the consultants proposed a financing package made from higher education funding council for england -lrb- hefce -rrb- capital grants , convergence funding which is distributed by the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- , contributions from ucf and dca , as well as borrowing , efficiency savings , fundraising and sponsorship .
but they warned : " there is an element of uncertainty associated with the eu funding . "
professor alan livingston , principal of ucf , said he was confident hefce , which funds about 70 % of dartington 's running costs , and the rda , would help fund the merger .
fight ahead " a merged institution will be a major contributor to the economic and cultural future of cornwall , " he said .
" the rda , i know , is really aware of the potential impact that will have on the regeneration of cornwall . "
we have the chance to make something of truly international significance professor alan livingston falmouth specialises in art , design and media , while dartington would bring dance , drama and music .
he said : " i think the logic is overwhelming .
" we have the chance to make something of truly international significance . "
jill sheen , higher education development manager at the rda , said dartington and falmouth would have to " fight their corner " .
she said : " you can not use public money to move it from one place to another .
" we have to consider the downside too , what is going to happen to south devon .
" the net impact could be zero in which case we would not do it . "
we have to take a fairly hard-nosed view of it jill sheen , rda she said the eu was expecting tangible results from convergence funding after six years of objective one funding ended last year .
" we have to take a fairly hard-nosed view of it .
" the eu is looking for something transformational .
" this is the last chance cornwall will have for funding on this sort of scale .
it has to work . "
a report for the rda and hefce by consultants burns owens in march said moving to falmouth was a better option than plymouth and torbay , which were also considered .
dartington hall trust has plans to make up the estimated £ 4.7m loss to the south devon economy from the loss of the college of arts .
ideas include an arts park to " incubate and support creative enterprises " and the doubling in size of the schumacher college , an environmental studies college at dartington .
both institutions are hoping for a legal agreement on the move to falmouth by late summer , agreement on funding by the autumn , and if there are no hitches , dartington could open in falmouth in september 2010 .

" convergence money is not available in devon because that is the way european funding works , " he said .
" it can only be spent in cornwall .
" it can not be spent on relocation per se , but it can fund economic activity and if we have an internationally successful arts institution in cornwall with all that dartington can bring , it would have an economic benefit to the area . "

while dartington 's famous hall was built in 1388 , the area around the estate is believed to have been continuously occupied for more than 1,000 years , the dartington hall trust says .
dartington itself was first mentioned in a royal charter dating back to 833 ad , and has maintained a noticeable presence in south devon history since that time .
the estate has seen its manor and its property become the crown 's and then go into private hands again several times .
during its times as royal property it was even given by henry viii to two of his wives : his second , catherine howard , and his final wife who survived him , catherine parr .
hard times its most recent purchase was in 1925 , when dorothy and leonard elmhurst took on the then run-down buildings and estate as part of a rural regeneration project they masterminded to halt the decline of the area after it had fallen on hard times .
the estates previous owners , the champerbowes , had owned the estate for 300 years , but a depression of the agricultural industry in the 19th century hit the family badly .
several parts of the estate were sold off , before the champerbowes eventually sold the remaining 800 acres to the elmhursts .
the estate was brought back up to 1,000 acres the estate is now managed by the dartington hall trust and in the intervening years it has been expanded to about 1,000 acres .
the trust says that throughout its modern history dartington " has invited creative people from around the world to its rural estate , encouraging them to conceive , develop and test promising ideas in a wide variety of fields " .
the so-called " dartington experiment " , as the trust describes it , has seen a number ventures over the years as part of its vision of encouraging people in many fields , particularly the arts , ecology , social justice and enterprise .
important chapter the most famous is arguably the arts college , which began in 1961 .
since opening , it has built-up a worldwide reputation for being able to encourage and inspire its students partly through their picturesque surroundings , something many students say a move may endanger .
college bosses said that the institution would " indeed maintain an active , long-term association with its place of origin " .
the college may be able to maintain its kudos despite the move , and dartington hall itself will do its best to maintain its reputation as an experimental environment working for the good of the area and beyond .
however , it may see itself falling into more hard times - maybe not to the degree experienced by former owners the champerbowes - but it certainly has to look at how to deal with any problems caused by one of its main economic and social assets leaving .

while dartington 's famous hall was built in 1388 , the area around the estate is believed to have been continuously occupied for more than 1,000 years , the dartington hall trust says .
dartington itself was first mentioned in a royal charter dating back to 833 ad , and has maintained a noticeable presence in south devon history since that time .
the estate has seen its manor and its property become the crown 's and then go into private hands again several times .
during its times as royal property it was even given by henry viii to two of his wives : his second , catherine howard , and his final wife who survived him , catherine parr .
hard times its most recent purchase was in 1925 , when dorothy and leonard elmhurst took on the then run-down buildings and estate as part of a rural regeneration project they masterminded to halt the decline of the area after it had fallen on hard times .
the estates previous owners , the champerbowes , had owned the estate for 300 years , but a depression of the agricultural industry in the 19th century hit the family badly .
several parts of the estate were sold off , before the champerbowes eventually sold the remaining 800 acres to the elmhursts .
the estate was brought back up to 1,000 acres the estate is now managed by the dartington hall trust and in the intervening years it has been expanded to about 1,000 acres .
the trust says that throughout its modern history dartington " has invited creative people from around the world to its rural estate , encouraging them to conceive , develop and test promising ideas in a wide variety of fields " .

during its times as royal property it was even given by henry viii to two of his wives : his second , catherine howard , and his final wife who survived him , catherine parr .
hard times its most recent purchase was in 1925 , when dorothy and leonard elmhurst took on the then run-down buildings and estate as part of a rural regeneration project they masterminded to halt the decline of the area after it had fallen on hard times .
the estates previous owners , the champerbowes , had owned the estate for 300 years , but a depression of the agricultural industry in the 19th century hit the family badly .
several parts of the estate were sold off , before the champerbowes eventually sold the remaining 800 acres to the elmhursts .
the estate was brought back up to 1,000 acres the estate is now managed by the dartington hall trust and in the intervening years it has been expanded to about 1,000 acres .
the trust says that throughout its modern history dartington " has invited creative people from around the world to its rural estate , encouraging them to conceive , develop and test promising ideas in a wide variety of fields " .
the so-called " dartington experiment " , as the trust describes it , has seen a number ventures over the years as part of its vision of encouraging people in many fields , particularly the arts , ecology , social justice and enterprise .
important chapter the most famous is arguably the arts college , which began in 1961 .
since opening , it has built-up a worldwide reputation for being able to encourage and inspire its students partly through their picturesque surroundings , something many students say a move may endanger .
college bosses said that the institution would " indeed maintain an active , long-term association with its place of origin " .
the college may be able to maintain its kudos despite the move , and dartington hall itself will do its best to maintain its reputation as an experimental environment working for the good of the area and beyond .
however , it may see itself falling into more hard times - maybe not to the degree experienced by former owners the champerbowes - but it certainly has to look at how to deal with any problems caused by one of its main economic and social assets leaving .

the rda is crucially involved in the proposed merger of dartington college of arts in totnes with university college in falmouth as it administers the european grants which will be necessary to fund the £ 25m move .
dartington 's governors agreed to the merger in march , claiming the college could no longer afford to remain at dartington .
since then , shock waves have reverberated through the town of totnes , which is inextricably linked with the college and its students .

the rda is crucially involved in the proposed merger of dartington college of arts in totnes with university college in falmouth as it administers the european grants which will be necessary to fund the £ 25m move .
dartington 's governors agreed to the merger in march , claiming the college could no longer afford to remain at dartington .
since then , shock waves have reverberated through the town of totnes , which is inextricably linked with the college and its students .
an impact study by south hams district council estimated a loss of £ 4.7m to the town 's economy and about 120 to 150 job losses if the college closes at its current site .
these statistics have raised concerns with those who live and work in totnes , but they are also worried about what will happen to the town 's image if and when the students go .

' still bonkers ' on the day of the governors ' announcement many of the college 's 680 students staged a protest outside the boardroom .
they believe the essence of the college comes from its relationship with the dartington hall trust that runs the 850-acre estate .
totnes has been home to the college since 1961 and the ancient town , which began life as a fortified saxon settlement , has a resident community of writers , therapists , musicians , and herbalists .

mike sealey , who also runs the totnes pet and garden centre , said : " it will have an impact financially - but no-one knows how much .
" i do n't think the funky image will change one iota .
we 'll still have the sandal brigade , crystals , beads and organic foods .

' lost in hippydom ' austin burn-jones runs the greenlife shop with his business partner mike sermon .
the shop epitomises what many totnes shoppers look for - ethical , fair trade , organic and gm-free products .
mr burn-jones believes the college 's move will affect the town on many levels .
" i think the impact will be catastrophic , " he said .
" students rent property here , so losing hundreds of them could mean a drop in rental prices .
" and there 'll be the knock-on effect on businesses , because the students wo n't be spending money in our shops , eateries and pubs .

they look back on their time there and reflect on what studying at the college has meant to them .
spike knowles programme tester " dartington gave you permission to experiment " gill capewell freelance voiceover " it was totally engaging and absorbing " pam matfield theatre practitioner " be prepared to change , because you will " mick jackson writer " i definitely count myself lucky to have studied there " angharad wynne-jones festival director " the teaching was superb " jo weekes artist " it was an intense and emotional time " spike knowles , 46 , programme tester at publishing company spike knowles at dartington in 1981 my drama teacher at sixth form college had been to dartington , i was doing a lot of drama at the time and she suggested i apply .
the ethos permeated through the teaching and some of it was a bit hippyish .
coming from a working class background , it was a bit annoying when i first got there , but you get sucked in .
dartington 's reputation attracted a lot of visiting artists .
an abiding memory is of a visit by the gay sweatshop theatre company - i made friends during that time that i still have now .
one of the really good things was taking theatre out into the community , a practical application of what we were learning .
it was four years in an idyllic place a favourite tutor was keith yon , who was from st helena .
he was our voice teacher and was an amazing person and a lovely man .
he brought such a different sensibility to the place .
i 've worked in this publishing company for 19 years now and dartington still has an effect on me .
what i took from my time there is an ability to think a lot more creatively .
dartington definitely allowed you to do that and gave you permission to experiment , it was a privilege to go there .
it was four years in an idyllic place .
click here to return mick jackson , 47 , writer mick jackson did a ba -lrb- hons -rrb- in theatre studies from 1979-83 i think i 'd decided i wanted to do something to do with the arts but that was all .
it was actually an aunt of mine who happened to spot an advert for the course in the guardian , thought it might be the kind of thing i might find interesting and mailed it down to me .
good old auntie molly .
there were several tutors who really helped me .
in my first year i was very taken with an acting tutor called joe richards .
but a writing tutor who introduced me lots of stuff to do with british folklore - and who i 'm still good friends with today - is peter kiddle .
what strikes me now is how much freedom we had in our productions .
do n't get me wrong .
i worked very hard right through the course .
i ca n't imagine having that sort of artistic freedom these days but i did n't mind , as it was something that i loved .
i ca n't imagine having that sort of artistic freedom these days .
and i had a full grant and my fees paid .
my time was right at the beginning of margaret thatcher 's reign .
the arts and education seemed almost to be considered the enemy by her government .
so i felt like i managed to slip in just before the door slammed behind me .
it was a fabulous location and the college was so small that you seemed to know just about ever other student in the place - even just to nod at .
there 's no doubt that it was an eccentric sort of establishment , but i definitely count myself lucky to have studied there .
click here to return gill capewell , 56 , freelance voiceover gill capewell : " the move will be the end of an era " i was nearly 30 and running a b & b when i decided that i wanted to go to drama school .
i was living in paignton and heard about the course at dartington and applied .
it would n't be an exaggeration to say it changed my life .
i had always done what others wanted me to do and now was a chance for me to do something for myself .
it was about living a dream and taking a risk and it gave me the freedom to be me .
the place had an amazing feeling of creativity and tranquillity it was totally engaging and absorbing and we worked so hard , there was an amazing feeling of creativity and tranquillity .
i have such strong memories of walking through the doors into the main square and that magic atmosphere .
the move will be the end of an era i 'm sure .
i do remember my personal tutor roger sell and peter hulton , who was so visionary .
i left after two years to take up an offer of a job in radio - which i did for 20 years but the last i heard i was free to go back and finish my degree if i ever wanted to !

i chose dartington because the course had a strong social context , because it was in beautiful countryside and because my partner went there .
i have so many memories of my time there ; falling off the back of my clapped-out moped as i went up one of the too-steep devon lanes and never knowing if i was going to hitch a 10-minute ride down the drive or have a one-hour walk into totnes ; forming a company - industrial and domestic theatre contractors .
i can remember lying on the floor in studio one with a guided relaxation and having an out-of-body experience and doing grotowski workshops with local kids in plymouth at the third-year studio .
i 'm never stuck for something to do the quality of the teaching from all my lecturers was superb .
i particularly remember peter hulton inspirational for his rigour , his emotional intelligence and commitment to beautiful reduction and mary fulkerson for making me stand still .
we made theatre , saw theatre and talked about theatre .
a lasting effect of my time there has been that i believe in the transformational power of art and creativity , i 'm never stuck for something to do and lifelong friendships .
click here to return pam matfield , 80 , retired theatre practitioner pam matfield in a dartington production of cabaret i was 56 when i got my degree from dartington - when my last child went off to university i decided to do a degree as well .
i always felt so privileged to have been chosen to go there , i was told they had 2,000 applicants , interviewed 200 and accepted 30 of us .
i took a lump sum from my pension to fund myself and it was the hardest four years of my life - i have never been so cold or so hungry but nor have i ever been so exhilarated .
i really enjoyed my third year in plymouth and loved bringing the community into the studio warehouse , which was off union street .
i did all sorts of things when i finished but i began to realise i was losing what i did the degree for .
so i started to look for and get work as a theatre practitioner , carrying on the dartington ethos .
be prepared to go with the flow when i was 75 i decided to stop and did a btec in art & design and am now a sculptor .
i have a belief in the goodness of mankind and dartington has helped me to share that belief through theatre , dance and music .
it was a wonderful experience .
i hope the ethos continues if they move to falmouth , which is itself a brilliant place .
what i would say to any student going there now is be prepared to go with the flow .
we all have expectations when we take on something new , but be prepared to change , because you will .
click here to return jo weekes , 72 , artist jo weekes during her time at dartington in the 1980s i had joined a very good drama group in dulverton where i was living and got the bug .
then , when i was 46 , my husband got a place at plymouth to do photography so i decided to apply for dartington and we moved to totnes .
it was hard being a mature student - physically , emotionally and mentally hard - but it was also fantastic and opened you up to everything .
i enjoyed my year out in plymouth which i spent with plymouth action community theatre , i remember working at moorhaven and doing a lot of work with patients there .
it was an intense and emotional time and something i will never forget .
who 's to say something better wo n't emerge it will be sad in a lot of ways if it does move but things do move on , who 's to say something better wo n't emerge ?
when i finished there i worked in a nursing home for six months as an occupational therapist , using techniques like reminiscence theatre .
it 's amazing when you see a spark of people 's younger selves , that was really worthwhile .
but i became ill after six months so i did n't really use my degree .
but now i have found art and work with paint and collage and have an exhibition of my work in totnes next year .
i 'm part terrified and part excited .
at dartington we used to say " follow the accident , fear the fixed plan , " i think that 's what dartington did for me .

the ethos permeated through the teaching and some of it was a bit hippyish .
coming from a working class background , it was a bit annoying when i first got there , but you get sucked in .
dartington 's reputation attracted a lot of visiting artists .
an abiding memory is of a visit by the gay sweatshop theatre company - i made friends during that time that i still have now .
one of the really good things was taking theatre out into the community , a practical application of what we were learning .
it was four years in an idyllic place a favourite tutor was keith yon , who was from st helena .
he was our voice teacher and was an amazing person and a lovely man .
he brought such a different sensibility to the place .
i 've worked in this publishing company for 19 years now and dartington still has an effect on me .
what i took from my time there is an ability to think a lot more creatively .

good old auntie molly .
there were several tutors who really helped me .
in my first year i was very taken with an acting tutor called joe richards .
but a writing tutor who introduced me lots of stuff to do with british folklore - and who i 'm still good friends with today - is peter kiddle .
what strikes me now is how much freedom we had in our productions .
do n't get me wrong .
i worked very hard right through the course .
i ca n't imagine having that sort of artistic freedom these days but i did n't mind , as it was something that i loved .

so i felt like i managed to slip in just before the door slammed behind me .

i left after two years to take up an offer of a job in radio - which i did for 20 years but the last i heard i was free to go back and finish my degree if i ever wanted to !
now my daughter is looking at colleges to do musical theatre , i just want her to follow her dream and not wait until she 's 30 .

i chose dartington because the course had a strong social context , because it was in beautiful countryside and because my partner went there .
i have so many memories of my time there ; falling off the back of my clapped-out moped as i went up one of the too-steep devon lanes and never knowing if i was going to hitch a 10-minute ride down the drive or have a one-hour walk into totnes ; forming a company - industrial and domestic theatre contractors .
i can remember lying on the floor in studio one with a guided relaxation and having an out-of-body experience and doing grotowski workshops with local kids in plymouth at the third-year studio .
i 'm never stuck for something to do the quality of the teaching from all my lecturers was superb .
i particularly remember peter hulton inspirational for his rigour , his emotional intelligence and commitment to beautiful reduction and mary fulkerson for making me stand still .
we made theatre , saw theatre and talked about theatre .
a lasting effect of my time there has been that i believe in the transformational power of art and creativity , i 'm never stuck for something to do and lifelong friendships .

i always felt so privileged to have been chosen to go there , i was told they had 2,000 applicants , interviewed 200 and accepted 30 of us .
i took a lump sum from my pension to fund myself and it was the hardest four years of my life - i have never been so cold or so hungry but nor have i ever been so exhilarated .
i really enjoyed my third year in plymouth and loved bringing the community into the studio warehouse , which was off union street .
i did all sorts of things when i finished but i began to realise i was losing what i did the degree for .
so i started to look for and get work as a theatre practitioner , carrying on the dartington ethos .
be prepared to go with the flow when i was 75 i decided to stop and did a btec in art & design and am now a sculptor .
i have a belief in the goodness of mankind and dartington has helped me to share that belief through theatre , dance and music .
it was a wonderful experience .
i hope the ethos continues if they move to falmouth , which is itself a brilliant place .
what i would say to any student going there now is be prepared to go with the flow .
we all have expectations when we take on something new , but be prepared to change , because you will .

then , when i was 46 , my husband got a place at plymouth to do photography so i decided to apply for dartington and we moved to totnes .
it was hard being a mature student - physically , emotionally and mentally hard - but it was also fantastic and opened you up to everything .
i enjoyed my year out in plymouth which i spent with plymouth action community theatre , i remember working at moorhaven and doing a lot of work with patients there .
it was an intense and emotional time and something i will never forget .
who 's to say something better wo n't emerge it will be sad in a lot of ways if it does move but things do move on , who 's to say something better wo n't emerge ?
when i finished there i worked in a nursing home for six months as an occupational therapist , using techniques like reminiscence theatre .
it 's amazing when you see a spark of people 's younger selves , that was really worthwhile .
but i became ill after six months so i did n't really use my degree .
but now i have found art and work with paint and collage and have an exhibition of my work in totnes next year .
i 'm part terrified and part excited .
at dartington we used to say " follow the accident , fear the fixed plan , " i think that 's what dartington did for me .

the ethos permeated through the teaching and some of it was a bit hippyish .
coming from a working class background , it was a bit annoying when i first got there , but you get sucked in .
dartington 's reputation attracted a lot of visiting artists .
an abiding memory is of a visit by the gay sweatshop theatre company - i made friends during that time that i still have now .
one of the really good things was taking theatre out into the community , a practical application of what we were learning .
it was four years in an idyllic place a favourite tutor was keith yon , who was from st helena .
he was our voice teacher and was an amazing person and a lovely man .
he brought such a different sensibility to the place .
i 've worked in this publishing company for 19 years now and dartington still has an effect on me .
what i took from my time there is an ability to think a lot more creatively .
dartington definitely allowed you to do that and gave you permission to experiment , it was a privilege to go there .

it was actually an aunt of mine who happened to spot an advert for the course in the guardian , thought it might be the kind of thing i might find interesting and mailed it down to me .
good old auntie molly .
there were several tutors who really helped me .
in my first year i was very taken with an acting tutor called joe richards .
but a writing tutor who introduced me lots of stuff to do with british folklore - and who i 'm still good friends with today - is peter kiddle .
what strikes me now is how much freedom we had in our productions .
do n't get me wrong .
i worked very hard right through the course .
i ca n't imagine having that sort of artistic freedom these days but i did n't mind , as it was something that i loved .
i ca n't imagine having that sort of artistic freedom these days .
and i had a full grant and my fees paid .
my time was right at the beginning of margaret thatcher 's reign .
the arts and education seemed almost to be considered the enemy by her government .
so i felt like i managed to slip in just before the door slammed behind me .
it was a fabulous location and the college was so small that you seemed to know just about ever other student in the place - even just to nod at .

i do remember my personal tutor roger sell and peter hulton , who was so visionary .
i left after two years to take up an offer of a job in radio - which i did for 20 years but the last i heard i was free to go back and finish my degree if i ever wanted to !
now my daughter is looking at colleges to do musical theatre , i just want her to follow her dream and not wait until she 's 30 .

i chose dartington because the course had a strong social context , because it was in beautiful countryside and because my partner went there .
i have so many memories of my time there ; falling off the back of my clapped-out moped as i went up one of the too-steep devon lanes and never knowing if i was going to hitch a 10-minute ride down the drive or have a one-hour walk into totnes ; forming a company - industrial and domestic theatre contractors .
i can remember lying on the floor in studio one with a guided relaxation and having an out-of-body experience and doing grotowski workshops with local kids in plymouth at the third-year studio .
i 'm never stuck for something to do the quality of the teaching from all my lecturers was superb .
i particularly remember peter hulton inspirational for his rigour , his emotional intelligence and commitment to beautiful reduction and mary fulkerson for making me stand still .
we made theatre , saw theatre and talked about theatre .
a lasting effect of my time there has been that i believe in the transformational power of art and creativity , i 'm never stuck for something to do and lifelong friendships .

i always felt so privileged to have been chosen to go there , i was told they had 2,000 applicants , interviewed 200 and accepted 30 of us .
i took a lump sum from my pension to fund myself and it was the hardest four years of my life - i have never been so cold or so hungry but nor have i ever been so exhilarated .
i really enjoyed my third year in plymouth and loved bringing the community into the studio warehouse , which was off union street .
i did all sorts of things when i finished but i began to realise i was losing what i did the degree for .
so i started to look for and get work as a theatre practitioner , carrying on the dartington ethos .
be prepared to go with the flow when i was 75 i decided to stop and did a btec in art & design and am now a sculptor .
i have a belief in the goodness of mankind and dartington has helped me to share that belief through theatre , dance and music .
it was a wonderful experience .
i hope the ethos continues if they move to falmouth , which is itself a brilliant place .
what i would say to any student going there now is be prepared to go with the flow .
we all have expectations when we take on something new , but be prepared to change , because you will .

then , when i was 46 , my husband got a place at plymouth to do photography so i decided to apply for dartington and we moved to totnes .
it was hard being a mature student - physically , emotionally and mentally hard - but it was also fantastic and opened you up to everything .
i enjoyed my year out in plymouth which i spent with plymouth action community theatre , i remember working at moorhaven and doing a lot of work with patients there .
it was an intense and emotional time and something i will never forget .
who 's to say something better wo n't emerge it will be sad in a lot of ways if it does move but things do move on , who 's to say something better wo n't emerge ?
when i finished there i worked in a nursing home for six months as an occupational therapist , using techniques like reminiscence theatre .
it 's amazing when you see a spark of people 's younger selves , that was really worthwhile .
but i became ill after six months so i did n't really use my degree .
but now i have found art and work with paint and collage and have an exhibition of my work in totnes next year .
i 'm part terrified and part excited .
at dartington we used to say " follow the accident , fear the fixed plan , " i think that 's what dartington did for me .

the ethos permeated through the teaching and some of it was a bit hippyish .
coming from a working class background , it was a bit annoying when i first got there , but you get sucked in .
dartington 's reputation attracted a lot of visiting artists .
an abiding memory is of a visit by the gay sweatshop theatre company - i made friends during that time that i still have now .
one of the really good things was taking theatre out into the community , a practical application of what we were learning .
it was four years in an idyllic place a favourite tutor was keith yon , who was from st helena .
he was our voice teacher and was an amazing person and a lovely man .
he brought such a different sensibility to the place .
i 've worked in this publishing company for 19 years now and dartington still has an effect on me .
what i took from my time there is an ability to think a lot more creatively .

good old auntie molly .
there were several tutors who really helped me .
in my first year i was very taken with an acting tutor called joe richards .
but a writing tutor who introduced me lots of stuff to do with british folklore - and who i 'm still good friends with today - is peter kiddle .
what strikes me now is how much freedom we had in our productions .
do n't get me wrong .
i worked very hard right through the course .
i ca n't imagine having that sort of artistic freedom these days but i did n't mind , as it was something that i loved .

so i felt like i managed to slip in just before the door slammed behind me .

i have such strong memories of walking through the doors into the main square and that magic atmosphere .
the move will be the end of an era i 'm sure .
i do remember my personal tutor roger sell and peter hulton , who was so visionary .
i left after two years to take up an offer of a job in radio - which i did for 20 years but the last i heard i was free to go back and finish my degree if i ever wanted to !
now my daughter is looking at colleges to do musical theatre , i just want her to follow her dream and not wait until she 's 30 .
click here to return angharad wynne-jones , 45 , director of london international festival of theatre " we made theatre , saw theatre and talked about theatre " i studied theatre from 1980 to 1984 .
i chose dartington because the course had a strong social context , because it was in beautiful countryside and because my partner went there .
i have so many memories of my time there ; falling off the back of my clapped-out moped as i went up one of the too-steep devon lanes and never knowing if i was going to hitch a 10-minute ride down the drive or have a one-hour walk into totnes ; forming a company - industrial and domestic theatre contractors .
i can remember lying on the floor in studio one with a guided relaxation and having an out-of-body experience and doing grotowski workshops with local kids in plymouth at the third-year studio .
i 'm never stuck for something to do the quality of the teaching from all my lecturers was superb .
i particularly remember peter hulton inspirational for his rigour , his emotional intelligence and commitment to beautiful reduction and mary fulkerson for making me stand still .
we made theatre , saw theatre and talked about theatre .
a lasting effect of my time there has been that i believe in the transformational power of art and creativity , i 'm never stuck for something to do and lifelong friendships .
click here to return pam matfield , 80 , retired theatre practitioner pam matfield in a dartington production of cabaret i was 56 when i got my degree from dartington - when my last child went off to university i decided to do a degree as well .
i always felt so privileged to have been chosen to go there , i was told they had 2,000 applicants , interviewed 200 and accepted 30 of us .
i took a lump sum from my pension to fund myself and it was the hardest four years of my life - i have never been so cold or so hungry but nor have i ever been so exhilarated .
i really enjoyed my third year in plymouth and loved bringing the community into the studio warehouse , which was off union street .
i did all sorts of things when i finished but i began to realise i was losing what i did the degree for .
so i started to look for and get work as a theatre practitioner , carrying on the dartington ethos .
be prepared to go with the flow when i was 75 i decided to stop and did a btec in art & design and am now a sculptor .
i have a belief in the goodness of mankind and dartington has helped me to share that belief through theatre , dance and music .
it was a wonderful experience .
i hope the ethos continues if they move to falmouth , which is itself a brilliant place .
what i would say to any student going there now is be prepared to go with the flow .
we all have expectations when we take on something new , but be prepared to change , because you will .
click here to return jo weekes , 72 , artist jo weekes during her time at dartington in the 1980s i had joined a very good drama group in dulverton where i was living and got the bug .
then , when i was 46 , my husband got a place at plymouth to do photography so i decided to apply for dartington and we moved to totnes .
it was hard being a mature student - physically , emotionally and mentally hard - but it was also fantastic and opened you up to everything .
i enjoyed my year out in plymouth which i spent with plymouth action community theatre , i remember working at moorhaven and doing a lot of work with patients there .
it was an intense and emotional time and something i will never forget .
who 's to say something better wo n't emerge it will be sad in a lot of ways if it does move but things do move on , who 's to say something better wo n't emerge ?
when i finished there i worked in a nursing home for six months as an occupational therapist , using techniques like reminiscence theatre .
it 's amazing when you see a spark of people 's younger selves , that was really worthwhile .
but i became ill after six months so i did n't really use my degree .
but now i have found art and work with paint and collage and have an exhibition of my work in totnes next year .
i 'm part terrified and part excited .
at dartington we used to say " follow the accident , fear the fixed plan , " i think that 's what dartington did for me .

they made the call at a meeting with the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- .
dca wants to merge with university college falmouth with most of the £ 25m cost coming from eu funds .
but save dartington college opposes eu funding to shift resources from one area of the south west to another .
it says the estimated £ 5m a year cost to the local economy if the internationally-renowned college moves is unacceptable .
dartington college founded 1961 637 students 40 staff specialises in dance , drama and music ' an eccentric sort of a place ' campaigners , who have collected thousands of signatures in support , also say the local area will suffer from the loss of a major arts organisation which has been in the area since the early 1960s .
spokesman and former college principal will fitzgerald , who met rda officials , said : " we are totally in favour of cornwall becoming a thriving place with the university and the arts , but it should not be at the expense of our community and lives being destroyed in south devon . "
the rda is crucial to the move because it distributes eu convergence funding in the region .
the college move is expected to cost about £ 25m according to a report by consultants burns owens for the rda , most of which is being sought from eu convergence funding .
' stitch-up ' mr fitzgerald said : " moving one asset from our part of the south west to another part of the south west is not what this money is for .
" if you are going to spend money on moving it , why not spend money to allow it to stay in dartington ?
" it has been a stitch-up .
" we want a government inquiry that considers all the options , including staying at dartington . "
he added : " we are under no illusions that we are taking on formidable forces , but we are sure that what we are asking for is right . "
dartington hall trust , which owns the college site , says that it does not have the £ 20m needed to update the college 's facilities and therefore the college must move or face closure .
research for the rda estimated that the south devon area would lose about £ 5m a year if the college moves .
an rda spokesman said : " we have not received a formal request for funding and no decisions have been taken to allocate rda or european funding to help relocate the college .
" the assessment of any future bid would quite rightly look in detail at the current situation and weigh up the potential economic costs and benefits to the region of supporting the college 's relocation to cornwall or other options . "

' stitch-up ' mr fitzgerald said : " moving one asset from our part of the south west to another part of the south west is not what this money is for .
" if you are going to spend money on moving it , why not spend money to allow it to stay in dartington ?
" it has been a stitch-up .
" we want a government inquiry that considers all the options , including staying at dartington . "
he added : " we are under no illusions that we are taking on formidable forces , but we are sure that what we are asking for is right . "
dartington hall trust , which owns the college site , says that it does not have the £ 20m needed to update the college 's facilities and therefore the college must move or face closure .
research for the rda estimated that the south devon area would lose about £ 5m a year if the college moves .
an rda spokesman said : " we have not received a formal request for funding and no decisions have been taken to allocate rda or european funding to help relocate the college .
" the assessment of any future bid would quite rightly look in detail at the current situation and weigh up the potential economic costs and benefits to the region of supporting the college 's relocation to cornwall or other options . "

they made the call at a meeting with the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- .
dca wants to merge with university college falmouth with most of the £ 25m cost coming from eu funds .
but save dartington college opposes eu funding to shift resources from one area of the south west to another .
it says the estimated £ 5m a year cost to the local economy if the internationally-renowned college moves is unacceptable .
dartington college founded 1961 637 students 40 staff specialises in dance , drama and music ' an eccentric sort of a place ' campaigners , who have collected thousands of signatures in support , also say the local area will suffer from the loss of a major arts organisation which has been in the area since the early 1960s .
spokesman and former college principal will fitzgerald , who met rda officials , said : " we are totally in favour of cornwall becoming a thriving place with the university and the arts , but it should not be at the expense of our community and lives being destroyed in south devon . "
the rda is crucial to the move because it distributes eu convergence funding in the region .
the college move is expected to cost about £ 25m according to a report by consultants burns owens for the rda , most of which is being sought from eu convergence funding .
' stitch-up ' mr fitzgerald said : " moving one asset from our part of the south west to another part of the south west is not what this money is for .
" if you are going to spend money on moving it , why not spend money to allow it to stay in dartington ?
" it has been a stitch-up .
" we want a government inquiry that considers all the options , including staying at dartington . "
he added : " we are under no illusions that we are taking on formidable forces , but we are sure that what we are asking for is right . "
dartington hall trust , which owns the college site , says that it does not have the £ 20m needed to update the college 's facilities and therefore the college must move or face closure .
research for the rda estimated that the south devon area would lose about £ 5m a year if the college moves .
an rda spokesman said : " we have not received a formal request for funding and no decisions have been taken to allocate rda or european funding to help relocate the college .
" the assessment of any future bid would quite rightly look in detail at the current situation and weigh up the potential economic costs and benefits to the region of supporting the college 's relocation to cornwall or other options . "

the former llanelli captain was admitted to hospital with a diabetes-related infection .
at first , two toes on his right foot were amputated , before the decision was taken to remove his right leg below the knee .
gravell said he was " humbled " by the messages of support he had received .
" people from all over the world - australia and new zealand - players i played against in the seventies , have been sending their best wishes - it 's been phenomenal , " the father-of-two said .
the bbc presenter returned to his home in mynydd y garreg , near kidwelly , carmarthenshire , after the operation last month .
he said the pain he felt before the amputation was torturous .
" my emotions have been stressed and pulled to the furthest most possible limit .
" i felt frightened , but i gained strength from my wife mari , she was like a rock .
" if it had n't been for her at that particular time , i do n't think i would have coped . "
the former wales and lions player said one of his main concerns was for his two daughters , gwennan and manon , and how they would react to the changes .
" it worried me immensely - but they hugged and kissed me and looked at the leg and the youngest , gwennan asked ' will it grow back ? ' .
" i thought it was a wonderful question and it caught my imagination . "
the operation came as a " shock " to gravell and his wife as they had gone to west wales general hospital in carmarthen to get a clean dressing after two of his toes were amputated .
" it had deteriorated , poison had set in and immediate action was needed .
the leg had to go , " gravell explained .
initially after recovering from the operation gravell admitted he felt " very gloomy " .
" but since that things have changed dramatically .
i 've been to morriston hospital to the artificial limb centre .
" there is a full life to be led after such an operation .
i 'm going to take one day at a time , whatever tomorrow brings , we will face and accept and go forward . "
gravell praised and thanked staff at the west wales general hospital who he said saved his life .
but he added that watching his beloved scarlets play in the heineken cup had lifted his spirits during his operations .
" i watched the scarlets play munster and beat them at stradey park .
for an hour and a half it was a pain-free zone .
sadly we did n't reach the final and the pain came back ! "
after 10 years , one mantle gravell is passing on to another former scarlets player is his role in the gorsedd ceremonies at the national eisteddfod .
robin mcbride will now be carrying the sword of peace in the ceremonies .
gravell , a key member of the wales team which won grand slams and triple crowns in the late 1970s and early 1980s , said the " rugby fraternity " had been a great support to him .
" it 's been immense .
i 've got a million ' thank yous ' to say . "

" 30 may , discussing leading labour into the next election , bbc breakfast with frost " if i am elected , i would serve a full third term .
i do not want to serve a fourth term - i do n't think the british people would want a prime minister to go on that long .
but i think it 's sensible to make plain my intention now . " 1 october , talking to the bbc after labour 's annual conference 2005 " it was a terrible , terrible thing to have happened .
i do n't believe we had any option however , but to disclose his name , because i think had we failed to do so , that would have been seen as attempting to conceal something from the committee that was looking in to this at the time . "
april , speaking to newsnight about the death of dr david kelly " i think i have a very clear idea of what the british people now expect from this government for a third term . " 6 may , after winning a third general election .

we welcome people here who are peaceful and law-abiding .

" every time i 've ever introduced a reform in government , i wish in retrospect i had gone further . " 27 september , at labour conference " sometimes it is better to lose and do the right thing than to win and do the wrong thing . " 9 november , before government loses vote on plans to detain terror suspects for up to 90 days without trial " you sit with our country 's flag ; you do not represent our country 's interest .
this is 2005 , not 1945 .
we 're not fighting each other anymore .
these are our partners and colleagues and our future lies in europe . " 20 december , addressing ukip members at a meeting of the european parliament 2006 " i think if you have faith about these things , you realise that judgement is made by other people - and if you believe in god , it 's made by god as well . " 4 march , when asked by michael parkinson on itv1 what role his christian faith had in his decision-making over the iraq war " this is not a clash between civilisations .
it is a clash about civilisation . " 21 march , on iraq " nobody in the labour party to my knowledge has sold honours or sold peerages and the fact that is sometimes excluded from the public 's mind in relation to this debate is that there are places in the house of lords that are reserved for party nominees for their party supporters . " 16 july , on the cash-for-honours investigation " the first thing i 'd like to do is apologise actually on behalf of the labour party for the last week which , with everything that 's going on back here and in the world , has not been our finest hour to be frank .
but i think what is important now is that we understand that it 's the interests of the country that come first and we move on .
now , as for my timing and date of departure , i would have preferred to do this in my own way but , as has been pretty obvious from what many of my cabinet colleagues have said earlier in the week , the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader . " 7 september , following an attempted " coup " " the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader , the next tuc conference next week will be my last tuc - probably to the relief of both of us .
but i am not going to set a precise date now .
i do n't think that 's right . " 7 september , on a visit to a school in north london " in no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy , least of all in politics , which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight .
but i know new labour would never have happened , and three election victories would never have been secured , without gordon brown .
he is a remarkable man .
a remarkable servant to this country .
and that is the truth . " 26 september , at labour conference " the truth is you ca n't go on forever .
that 's why it is right that this is my last conference as leader . " 26 september , at labour conference " at least i do n't have to worry about her running off with the bloke next door . " 26 september , on wife cherie 's alleged criticism of chancellor gordon brown " however much he dances around the ring beforehand , he will come in reach of a big clunking fist and , you know what , he 'll be out on his feet , carried out of the ring . " 15 november , predicting tory leader david cameron will struggle with whoever becomes the next labour prime minister " it has , but you see what i say to people is why is it difficult in iraq ?
it 's not difficult because of some accident in planning . " 17 november , when asked by sir david frost on al jazeera whether the violence in iraq has " so far been pretty much of a disaster " 2007 " as has been very obvious from the comments of other ministers and indeed my own official spokesman , the manner of the execution of saddam was completely wrong . " 9 january , after ex-iraqi leader saddam hussein is hanged amid jeering " i 'm not going to beg for my character . " 2 february , after he is interviewed by police for a second time in relation to the cash-for-honours inquiry " this is a very important day for the people of northern ireland , but also for the people and the history of these islands . " 26 march , after it is announced devolved government is returning to northern ireland " there are people who still think that the compromises that were made along the way were unacceptable .
but sometimes politics is about that in order to achieve a better end .
and there are always two kinds of people in politics : those who stand aside and commentate and those who get their hands dirty and do . " 8 may , as devolution returns to northern ireland " i ask you to accept one thing .
hand on heart , i did what i thought was right .
i may have been wrong .
that 's your call .
i have been very lucky and very blessed .
this country is a blessed nation .
the british are special , the world knows it , in our innermost thoughts , we know it .
this is the greatest nation on earth .
it has been an honour to serve it . " 10 may , in speech announcing he will resign as prime minister .
" i give my thanks to you , the british people , for the times i have succeeded , and my apologies to you for the times i have fallen short . "

" 4 march , when asked by michael parkinson on itv1 what role his christian faith had in his decision-making over the iraq war " this is not a clash between civilisations .
it is a clash about civilisation . " 21 march , on iraq " nobody in the labour party to my knowledge has sold honours or sold peerages and the fact that is sometimes excluded from the public 's mind in relation to this debate is that there are places in the house of lords that are reserved for party nominees for their party supporters . " 16 july , on the cash-for-honours investigation " the first thing i 'd like to do is apologise actually on behalf of the labour party for the last week which , with everything that 's going on back here and in the world , has not been our finest hour to be frank .
but i think what is important now is that we understand that it 's the interests of the country that come first and we move on .
now , as for my timing and date of departure , i would have preferred to do this in my own way but , as has been pretty obvious from what many of my cabinet colleagues have said earlier in the week , the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader . " 7 september , following an attempted " coup " " the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader , the next tuc conference next week will be my last tuc - probably to the relief of both of us .
but i am not going to set a precise date now .
i do n't think that 's right . " 7 september , on a visit to a school in north london " in no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy , least of all in politics , which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight .
but i know new labour would never have happened , and three election victories would never have been secured , without gordon brown .
he is a remarkable man .
a remarkable servant to this country .
and that is the truth . " 26 september , at labour conference " the truth is you ca n't go on forever .
that 's why it is right that this is my last conference as leader . " 26 september , at labour conference " at least i do n't have to worry about her running off with the bloke next door . " 26 september , on wife cherie 's alleged criticism of chancellor gordon brown " however much he dances around the ring beforehand , he will come in reach of a big clunking fist and , you know what , he 'll be out on his feet , carried out of the ring . " 15 november , predicting tory leader david cameron will struggle with whoever becomes the next labour prime minister " it has , but you see what i say to people is why is it difficult in iraq ?
it 's not difficult because of some accident in planning . " 17 november , when asked by sir david frost on al jazeera whether the violence in iraq has " so far been pretty much of a disaster " 2007 " as has been very obvious from the comments of other ministers and indeed my own official spokesman , the manner of the execution of saddam was completely wrong . " 9 january , after ex-iraqi leader saddam hussein is hanged amid jeering " i 'm not going to beg for my character . " 2 february , after he is interviewed by police for a second time in relation to the cash-for-honours inquiry " this is a very important day for the people of northern ireland , but also for the people and the history of these islands . " 26 march , after it is announced devolved government is returning to northern ireland " there are people who still think that the compromises that were made along the way were unacceptable .
but sometimes politics is about that in order to achieve a better end .
and there are always two kinds of people in politics : those who stand aside and commentate and those who get their hands dirty and do . " 8 may , as devolution returns to northern ireland " i ask you to accept one thing .
hand on heart , i did what i thought was right .
i may have been wrong .
that 's your call .
i have been very lucky and very blessed .
this country is a blessed nation .
the british are special , the world knows it , in our innermost thoughts , we know it .
this is the greatest nation on earth .
it has been an honour to serve it . " 10 may , in speech announcing he will resign as prime minister .
" i give my thanks to you , the british people , for the times i have succeeded , and my apologies to you for the times i have fallen short . "

" 16 july , on the cash-for-honours investigation " the first thing i 'd like to do is apologise actually on behalf of the labour party for the last week which , with everything that 's going on back here and in the world , has not been our finest hour to be frank .
but i think what is important now is that we understand that it 's the interests of the country that come first and we move on .
now , as for my timing and date of departure , i would have preferred to do this in my own way but , as has been pretty obvious from what many of my cabinet colleagues have said earlier in the week , the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader . " 7 september , following an attempted " coup " " the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader , the next tuc conference next week will be my last tuc - probably to the relief of both of us .
but i am not going to set a precise date now .
i do n't think that 's right . " 7 september , on a visit to a school in north london " in no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy , least of all in politics , which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight .
but i know new labour would never have happened , and three election victories would never have been secured , without gordon brown .
he is a remarkable man .
a remarkable servant to this country .
and that is the truth . " 26 september , at labour conference " the truth is you ca n't go on forever .
that 's why it is right that this is my last conference as leader . " 26 september , at labour conference " at least i do n't have to worry about her running off with the bloke next door . " 26 september , on wife cherie 's alleged criticism of chancellor gordon brown " however much he dances around the ring beforehand , he will come in reach of a big clunking fist and , you know what , he 'll be out on his feet , carried out of the ring . " 15 november , predicting tory leader david cameron will struggle with whoever becomes the next labour prime minister " it has , but you see what i say to people is why is it difficult in iraq ?
it 's not difficult because of some accident in planning . " 17 november , when asked by sir david frost on al jazeera whether the violence in iraq has " so far been pretty much of a disaster " 2007 " as has been very obvious from the comments of other ministers and indeed my own official spokesman , the manner of the execution of saddam was completely wrong . " 9 january , after ex-iraqi leader saddam hussein is hanged amid jeering " i 'm not going to beg for my character . " 2 february , after he is interviewed by police for a second time in relation to the cash-for-honours inquiry " this is a very important day for the people of northern ireland , but also for the people and the history of these islands . " 26 march , after it is announced devolved government is returning to northern ireland " there are people who still think that the compromises that were made along the way were unacceptable .
but sometimes politics is about that in order to achieve a better end .
and there are always two kinds of people in politics : those who stand aside and commentate and those who get their hands dirty and do . " 8 may , as devolution returns to northern ireland " i ask you to accept one thing .
hand on heart , i did what i thought was right .
i may have been wrong .
that 's your call .
i have been very lucky and very blessed .
this country is a blessed nation .
the british are special , the world knows it , in our innermost thoughts , we know it .
this is the greatest nation on earth .
it has been an honour to serve it . " 10 may , in speech announcing he will resign as prime minister .
" i give my thanks to you , the british people , for the times i have succeeded , and my apologies to you for the times i have fallen short . "

" 24 september , foreword to uk government dossier on iraqi weapons of mass destruction " conflict is not inevitable , but disarmament is .

" 21 march , broadcast to the nation after the start of the war " i take full responsibility for decisions .
i stand by them .
i believe they were the right decisions .

" 30 september , labour conference speech " my health is absolutely fine - i 'm feeling great .

" 26 february , downing street news conference as ms short claims un offices were bugged " it does not mean forgetting the pain of the past but it does mean recognising it 's time to move on . " 25 march , after his historic talks with libya 's colonel gaddafi " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the centre and heart of european decision-making or not . " 20 april , telling mps about his u-turn on holding a euro constitution referendum " i am absolutely up for it ... " 30 may , discussing leading labour into the next election , bbc breakfast with frost " if i am elected , i would serve a full third term .
i do not want to serve a fourth term - i do n't think the british people would want a prime minister to go on that long .
but i think it 's sensible to make plain my intention now . " 1 october , talking to the bbc after labour 's annual conference 2005 " it was a terrible , terrible thing to have happened .
i do n't believe we had any option however , but to disclose his name , because i think had we failed to do so , that would have been seen as attempting to conceal something from the committee that was looking in to this at the time . "
april , speaking to newsnight about the death of dr david kelly " i think i have a very clear idea of what the british people now expect from this government for a third term . " 6 may , after winning a third general election .

" it is a very sad day for the british people but we will hold true to the british way of life . " 7 july , following the london tube and bus bombings .
" the rules of the game have changed .
we welcome people here who are peaceful and law-abiding .

if you meddle in it or engage in it , then you 're going to go back out again . " 5 august , on the government 's attitude to terrorists .
" every time i 've ever introduced a reform in government , i wish in retrospect i had gone further . " 27 september , at labour conference " sometimes it is better to lose and do the right thing than to win and do the wrong thing . " 9 november , before government loses vote on plans to detain terror suspects for up to 90 days without trial " you sit with our country 's flag ; you do not represent our country 's interest .
this is 2005 , not 1945 .
we 're not fighting each other anymore .
these are our partners and colleagues and our future lies in europe . " 20 december , addressing ukip members at a meeting of the european parliament 2006 " i think if you have faith about these things , you realise that judgement is made by other people - and if you believe in god , it 's made by god as well . " 4 march , when asked by michael parkinson on itv1 what role his christian faith had in his decision-making over the iraq war " this is not a clash between civilisations .
it is a clash about civilisation . " 21 march , on iraq " nobody in the labour party to my knowledge has sold honours or sold peerages and the fact that is sometimes excluded from the public 's mind in relation to this debate is that there are places in the house of lords that are reserved for party nominees for their party supporters . " 16 july , on the cash-for-honours investigation " the first thing i 'd like to do is apologise actually on behalf of the labour party for the last week which , with everything that 's going on back here and in the world , has not been our finest hour to be frank .
but i think what is important now is that we understand that it 's the interests of the country that come first and we move on .
now , as for my timing and date of departure , i would have preferred to do this in my own way but , as has been pretty obvious from what many of my cabinet colleagues have said earlier in the week , the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader . " 7 september , following an attempted " coup " " the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader , the next tuc conference next week will be my last tuc - probably to the relief of both of us .
but i am not going to set a precise date now .
i do n't think that 's right . " 7 september , on a visit to a school in north london " in no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy , least of all in politics , which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight .
but i know new labour would never have happened , and three election victories would never have been secured , without gordon brown .
he is a remarkable man .
a remarkable servant to this country .
and that is the truth . " 26 september , at labour conference " the truth is you ca n't go on forever .
that 's why it is right that this is my last conference as leader . " 26 september , at labour conference " at least i do n't have to worry about her running off with the bloke next door . " 26 september , on wife cherie 's alleged criticism of chancellor gordon brown " however much he dances around the ring beforehand , he will come in reach of a big clunking fist and , you know what , he 'll be out on his feet , carried out of the ring . " 15 november , predicting tory leader david cameron will struggle with whoever becomes the next labour prime minister " it has , but you see what i say to people is why is it difficult in iraq ?
it 's not difficult because of some accident in planning . " 17 november , when asked by sir david frost on al jazeera whether the violence in iraq has " so far been pretty much of a disaster " 2007 " as has been very obvious from the comments of other ministers and indeed my own official spokesman , the manner of the execution of saddam was completely wrong . " 9 january , after ex-iraqi leader saddam hussein is hanged amid jeering " i 'm not going to beg for my character . " 2 february , after he is interviewed by police for a second time in relation to the cash-for-honours inquiry " this is a very important day for the people of northern ireland , but also for the people and the history of these islands . " 26 march , after it is announced devolved government is returning to northern ireland " there are people who still think that the compromises that were made along the way were unacceptable .
but sometimes politics is about that in order to achieve a better end .
and there are always two kinds of people in politics : those who stand aside and commentate and those who get their hands dirty and do . " 8 may , as devolution returns to northern ireland " i ask you to accept one thing .
hand on heart , i did what i thought was right .
i may have been wrong .
that 's your call .
i have been very lucky and very blessed .
this country is a blessed nation .
the british are special , the world knows it , in our innermost thoughts , we know it .
this is the greatest nation on earth .
it has been an honour to serve it . " 10 may , in speech announcing he will resign as prime minister .

" 26 february , downing street news conference as ms short claims un offices were bugged " it does not mean forgetting the pain of the past but it does mean recognising it 's time to move on . " 25 march , after his historic talks with libya 's colonel gaddafi " it is time to resolve once and for all whether this country , britain , wants to be at the centre and heart of european decision-making or not . " 20 april , telling mps about his u-turn on holding a euro constitution referendum " i am absolutely up for it ... " 30 may , discussing leading labour into the next election , bbc breakfast with frost " if i am elected , i would serve a full third term .
i do not want to serve a fourth term - i do n't think the british people would want a prime minister to go on that long .
but i think it 's sensible to make plain my intention now . " 1 october , talking to the bbc after labour 's annual conference 2005 " it was a terrible , terrible thing to have happened .
i do n't believe we had any option however , but to disclose his name , because i think had we failed to do so , that would have been seen as attempting to conceal something from the committee that was looking in to this at the time . "
april , speaking to newsnight about the death of dr david kelly " i think i have a very clear idea of what the british people now expect from this government for a third term . " 6 may , after winning a third general election .
" it 's not often in this job that you punch the air and do a little jig and embrace the person next to you . " 7 july , after london wins the right to host the 2012 olympics .
" it is a very sad day for the british people but we will hold true to the british way of life . " 7 july , following the london tube and bus bombings .
" the rules of the game have changed .
we welcome people here who are peaceful and law-abiding .
people who want to be british citizens should share our values and our way of life .
but if you come to our country from abroad , do n't meddle in extremism .
if you meddle in it or engage in it , then you 're going to go back out again . " 5 august , on the government 's attitude to terrorists .
" every time i 've ever introduced a reform in government , i wish in retrospect i had gone further . " 27 september , at labour conference " sometimes it is better to lose and do the right thing than to win and do the wrong thing . " 9 november , before government loses vote on plans to detain terror suspects for up to 90 days without trial " you sit with our country 's flag ; you do not represent our country 's interest .
this is 2005 , not 1945 .
we 're not fighting each other anymore .
these are our partners and colleagues and our future lies in europe . " 20 december , addressing ukip members at a meeting of the european parliament 2006 " i think if you have faith about these things , you realise that judgement is made by other people - and if you believe in god , it 's made by god as well . " 4 march , when asked by michael parkinson on itv1 what role his christian faith had in his decision-making over the iraq war " this is not a clash between civilisations .
it is a clash about civilisation . " 21 march , on iraq " nobody in the labour party to my knowledge has sold honours or sold peerages and the fact that is sometimes excluded from the public 's mind in relation to this debate is that there are places in the house of lords that are reserved for party nominees for their party supporters . " 16 july , on the cash-for-honours investigation " the first thing i 'd like to do is apologise actually on behalf of the labour party for the last week which , with everything that 's going on back here and in the world , has not been our finest hour to be frank .
but i think what is important now is that we understand that it 's the interests of the country that come first and we move on .
now , as for my timing and date of departure , i would have preferred to do this in my own way but , as has been pretty obvious from what many of my cabinet colleagues have said earlier in the week , the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader . " 7 september , following an attempted " coup " " the next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader , the next tuc conference next week will be my last tuc - probably to the relief of both of us .
but i am not going to set a precise date now .
i do n't think that 's right . " 7 september , on a visit to a school in north london " in no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy , least of all in politics , which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight .
but i know new labour would never have happened , and three election victories would never have been secured , without gordon brown .
he is a remarkable man .
a remarkable servant to this country .
and that is the truth . " 26 september , at labour conference " the truth is you ca n't go on forever .
that 's why it is right that this is my last conference as leader . " 26 september , at labour conference " at least i do n't have to worry about her running off with the bloke next door . " 26 september , on wife cherie 's alleged criticism of chancellor gordon brown " however much he dances around the ring beforehand , he will come in reach of a big clunking fist and , you know what , he 'll be out on his feet , carried out of the ring . " 15 november , predicting tory leader david cameron will struggle with whoever becomes the next labour prime minister " it has , but you see what i say to people is why is it difficult in iraq ?
it 's not difficult because of some accident in planning . " 17 november , when asked by sir david frost on al jazeera whether the violence in iraq has " so far been pretty much of a disaster " 2007 " as has been very obvious from the comments of other ministers and indeed my own official spokesman , the manner of the execution of saddam was completely wrong . " 9 january , after ex-iraqi leader saddam hussein is hanged amid jeering " i 'm not going to beg for my character . " 2 february , after he is interviewed by police for a second time in relation to the cash-for-honours inquiry " this is a very important day for the people of northern ireland , but also for the people and the history of these islands . " 26 march , after it is announced devolved government is returning to northern ireland " there are people who still think that the compromises that were made along the way were unacceptable .
but sometimes politics is about that in order to achieve a better end .
and there are always two kinds of people in politics : those who stand aside and commentate and those who get their hands dirty and do . " 8 may , as devolution returns to northern ireland " i ask you to accept one thing .
hand on heart , i did what i thought was right .
i may have been wrong .
that 's your call .
i have been very lucky and very blessed .
this country is a blessed nation .
the british are special , the world knows it , in our innermost thoughts , we know it .
this is the greatest nation on earth .
it has been an honour to serve it . " 10 may , in speech announcing he will resign as prime minister .
" i give my thanks to you , the british people , for the times i have succeeded , and my apologies to you for the times i have fallen short . "

janus friis and niklas zennstroem set up joost in january 2006 to offer broadband users full-screen , high-quality video on their computers .
cbs and viacom are already content providers for the service .
the other investors are index ventures , sequoia capital and li ka-shing , the chairman of hutchison whampoa .
content deals index ventures is a european venture capital firm , while sequoia capital is described as having been the first investor and business partner of companies making up 10 % of the value of the nasdaq hi-tech index .
mr friis and mr zennstroem were also behind the music site kazaa , which was unpopular with the music industry because people used it to download music without paying for it .
there are not expected to be any such problems with joost , which has signed deals with content providers such as viacom , which is providing content from mtv , nickelodeon , paramount and comedy central .
online video viewing has taken off as broadband connections have become more popular , but there is some concern that people with monthly download limits on their connections may have to pay more if they use joost .
