" steinmeier , whose remarks were released a day ahead of publication on sunday , said he told rice the warrants could only be served in germany at present , but the government expected the court to issue international warrants at some stage . a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office said saturday that issuing international arrest warrants " was a formality . " a court in munich earlier this week issued 13 arrest warrants for false imprisonment against the cia suspects , accusing them of seizing khaled el-masri on suspicion of terrorism in 2003 .

" the timeframe appears favorable , " the chancellor said in her weekly internet video address , which coincided with the start of a four-nation tour of the middle east . merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidencies of the european union and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , arrived in cairo saturday afternoon for talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak on ways of breathing new life into the stalled mideast peace process .

the russian took the ball around goalkeeper oliver kahn and pushed it into the empty net . slovakian international robert vittek could have made it two a few minutes later , but saw his header hit the crossbar . a lot of work to be done hitzfeld brought on german striker lukas podolski as a third forward in an attempt to change his side 's fortune , but instead of scoring an equalizer , bayern found themselves two goals down when schroth scored his side 's second in the 71st with a close-range header . any chance bayern had of snatching an unexpected - and undeserved - draw were dashed four minutes from the end with a fine solo effort by vittek who played cat and mouse with the bayern defense before scoring with a right-footed shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg coach hans meyer enjoyed pulling down his bavarian rivals " it was disappointing to see how the team collapsed at the end of the game and to see how little confidence they had , " hitzfeld said .
" there is a lot of work that needs to be done . " nuremberg more confident scorer schroth , whose goal helped give nuremberg their first victory against bayern since may 1999 said that they had known that they had a chance to win . " we are doing well at the moment and we have seen some weaknesses in bayern , " he said .
" we made use of those . " for bayern , who have picked up just one point from their three first games of the second half of the season , it is the worst start after the winter break since 1975 . the result sees bayern remain in fourth place on 34 points , while nuremberg move two places to fifth with 30 points . one of the two leading clubs , werder bremen or schalke 04 who are currently on 42 points , could pull 11 points ahead of bayern on sunday .

" a court in munich earlier this week issued 13 arrest warrants for false imprisonment against the cia suspects , accusing them of seizing khaled el-masri on suspicion of terrorism in 2003 .
the suspects were crew and passengers on an aircraft that flew el-masri from macedonia to afghanistan in a practice known as extraordinary rendition . reviving the mideast quartet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu , us , un and russia make up the quartet the german minister met rice on friday in washington where the two officials were taking part in a meeting of international mediators known as the mideast quartet . the quartet , which met for the first time in five months friday , drew up a " roadmap " for peace in 2003 but its aim of creating a palestinian state by 2005 was derailed by a flare-up of violence and the election victory of the radical islamic movement hamas . the powers friday endorsed a us plan to revitalize the road map , which envisages a three-phase effort focused first on ending palestinian attacks on israel and restricting israeli activities inside the occupied territories and then moving on to steps towards the establishment of a palestinian state . gaza violence mars meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in gaza was one of the topics the mideast quartet discussed but the initiative was overshadowed by renewed palestinian factional violence , a rift with russia over whether to bring syria into the process and a weary skepticism that israeli and palestinian leaders are strong enough to lead their people to peace . german chancellor angela merkel said saturday that she was hopeful the israeli-palestinian conflict could be resolved through a two-state solution . " the timeframe appears favorable , " the chancellor said in her weekly internet video address , which coincided with the start of a four-nation tour of the middle east . merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidencies of the european union and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , arrived in cairo saturday afternoon for talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak on ways of breathing new life into the stalled mideast peace process .

" steinmeier , whose remarks were released a day ahead of publication on sunday , said he told rice the warrants could only be served in germany at present , but the government expected the court to issue international warrants at some stage . a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office said saturday that issuing international arrest warrants " was a formality . " a court in munich earlier this week issued 13 arrest warrants for false imprisonment against the cia suspects , accusing them of seizing khaled el-masri on suspicion of terrorism in 2003 .
the suspects were crew and passengers on an aircraft that flew el-masri from macedonia to afghanistan in a practice known as extraordinary rendition . reviving the mideast quartet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu , us , un and russia make up the quartet the german minister met rice on friday in washington where the two officials were taking part in a meeting of international mediators known as the mideast quartet . the quartet , which met for the first time in five months friday , drew up a " roadmap " for peace in 2003 but its aim of creating a palestinian state by 2005 was derailed by a flare-up of violence and the election victory of the radical islamic movement hamas . the powers friday endorsed a us plan to revitalize the road map , which envisages a three-phase effort focused first on ending palestinian attacks on israel and restricting israeli activities inside the occupied territories and then moving on to steps towards the establishment of a palestinian state . gaza violence mars meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in gaza was one of the topics the mideast quartet discussed but the initiative was overshadowed by renewed palestinian factional violence , a rift with russia over whether to bring syria into the process and a weary skepticism that israeli and palestinian leaders are strong enough to lead their people to peace . german chancellor angela merkel said saturday that she was hopeful the israeli-palestinian conflict could be resolved through a two-state solution . " the timeframe appears favorable , " the chancellor said in her weekly internet video address , which coincided with the start of a four-nation tour of the middle east . merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidencies of the european union and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , arrived in cairo saturday afternoon for talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak on ways of breathing new life into the stalled mideast peace process .

the russian took the ball around goalkeeper oliver kahn and pushed it into the empty net . slovakian international robert vittek could have made it two a few minutes later , but saw his header hit the crossbar . a lot of work to be done hitzfeld brought on german striker lukas podolski as a third forward in an attempt to change his side 's fortune , but instead of scoring an equalizer , bayern found themselves two goals down when schroth scored his side 's second in the 71st with a close-range header . any chance bayern had of snatching an unexpected - and undeserved - draw were dashed four minutes from the end with a fine solo effort by vittek who played cat and mouse with the bayern defense before scoring with a right-footed shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg coach hans meyer enjoyed pulling down his bavarian rivals " it was disappointing to see how the team collapsed at the end of the game and to see how little confidence they had , " hitzfeld said .
" there is a lot of work that needs to be done . " nuremberg more confident scorer schroth , whose goal helped give nuremberg their first victory against bayern since may 1999 said that they had known that they had a chance to win . " we are doing well at the moment and we have seen some weaknesses in bayern , " he said .
" we made use of those . " for bayern , who have picked up just one point from their three first games of the second half of the season , it is the worst start after the winter break since 1975 . the result sees bayern remain in fourth place on 34 points , while nuremberg move two places to fifth with 30 points . one of the two leading clubs , werder bremen or schalke 04 who are currently on 42 points , could pull 11 points ahead of bayern on sunday .

the russian took the ball around goalkeeper oliver kahn and pushed it into the empty net . slovakian international robert vittek could have made it two a few minutes later , but saw his header hit the crossbar . a lot of work to be done hitzfeld brought on german striker lukas podolski as a third forward in an attempt to change his side 's fortune , but instead of scoring an equalizer , bayern found themselves two goals down when schroth scored his side 's second in the 71st with a close-range header . any chance bayern had of snatching an unexpected - and undeserved - draw were dashed four minutes from the end with a fine solo effort by vittek who played cat and mouse with the bayern defense before scoring with a right-footed shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg coach hans meyer enjoyed pulling down his bavarian rivals " it was disappointing to see how the team collapsed at the end of the game and to see how little confidence they had , " hitzfeld said .
" there is a lot of work that needs to be done . " nuremberg more confident scorer schroth , whose goal helped give nuremberg their first victory against bayern since may 1999 said that they had known that they had a chance to win .

the russian took the ball around goalkeeper oliver kahn and pushed it into the empty net . slovakian international robert vittek could have made it two a few minutes later , but saw his header hit the crossbar . a lot of work to be done hitzfeld brought on german striker lukas podolski as a third forward in an attempt to change his side 's fortune , but instead of scoring an equalizer , bayern found themselves two goals down when schroth scored his side 's second in the 71st with a close-range header . any chance bayern had of snatching an unexpected - and undeserved - draw were dashed four minutes from the end with a fine solo effort by vittek who played cat and mouse with the bayern defense before scoring with a right-footed shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg coach hans meyer enjoyed pulling down his bavarian rivals " it was disappointing to see how the team collapsed at the end of the game and to see how little confidence they had , " hitzfeld said .
" there is a lot of work that needs to be done . " nuremberg more confident scorer schroth , whose goal helped give nuremberg their first victory against bayern since may 1999 said that they had known that they had a chance to win .

" samples from the infected establishment were immediately sent to the community reference laboratory in weybridge , which has this morning swiftly confirmed the disease to be the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , " the statement said .

" we would not expect this to happen in the middle of winter .
if it was going to happen we would expect it to happen in spring . " the next thing we need to know is if this is a primary or secondary case .
if this is a secondary case it is much more serious .
if this is the first case , or ' reference case ' and we can stamp it out , the outbreak will be controlled . " mass culling expected peter kendall , president of the national farmers ' union , told bbc television that there would be a mass cull and said that emergency meetings were underway on how to handle the situation . " there 's enormous concern , both for the whole farming community , the producers of poultry in the united kingdom , and making sure we get the message about how well this will be managed and controlled , " he said . " we 're encouraging all farmers to be incredibly vigilant , look at their flocks carefully , " kendall added .

" steinmeier , whose remarks were released a day ahead of publication on sunday , said he told rice the warrants could only be served in germany at present , but the government expected the court to issue international warrants at some stage . a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office said saturday that issuing international arrest warrants " was a formality . " a court in munich earlier this week issued 13 arrest warrants for false imprisonment against the cia suspects , accusing them of seizing khaled el-masri on suspicion of terrorism in 2003 .
the suspects were crew and passengers on an aircraft that flew el-masri from macedonia to afghanistan in a practice known as extraordinary rendition . reviving the mideast quartet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu , us , un and russia make up the quartet the german minister met rice on friday in washington where the two officials were taking part in a meeting of international mediators known as the mideast quartet . the quartet , which met for the first time in five months friday , drew up a " roadmap " for peace in 2003 but its aim of creating a palestinian state by 2005 was derailed by a flare-up of violence and the election victory of the radical islamic movement hamas . the powers friday endorsed a us plan to revitalize the road map , which envisages a three-phase effort focused first on ending palestinian attacks on israel and restricting israeli activities inside the occupied territories and then moving on to steps towards the establishment of a palestinian state . gaza violence mars meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in gaza was one of the topics the mideast quartet discussed but the initiative was overshadowed by renewed palestinian factional violence , a rift with russia over whether to bring syria into the process and a weary skepticism that israeli and palestinian leaders are strong enough to lead their people to peace . german chancellor angela merkel said saturday that she was hopeful the israeli-palestinian conflict could be resolved through a two-state solution . " the timeframe appears favorable , " the chancellor said in her weekly internet video address , which coincided with the start of a four-nation tour of the middle east . merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidencies of the european union and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , arrived in cairo saturday afternoon for talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak on ways of breathing new life into the stalled mideast peace process .

the russian took the ball around goalkeeper oliver kahn and pushed it into the empty net . slovakian international robert vittek could have made it two a few minutes later , but saw his header hit the crossbar . a lot of work to be done hitzfeld brought on german striker lukas podolski as a third forward in an attempt to change his side 's fortune , but instead of scoring an equalizer , bayern found themselves two goals down when schroth scored his side 's second in the 71st with a close-range header . any chance bayern had of snatching an unexpected - and undeserved - draw were dashed four minutes from the end with a fine solo effort by vittek who played cat and mouse with the bayern defense before scoring with a right-footed shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg coach hans meyer enjoyed pulling down his bavarian rivals " it was disappointing to see how the team collapsed at the end of the game and to see how little confidence they had , " hitzfeld said .
" there is a lot of work that needs to be done . " nuremberg more confident scorer schroth , whose goal helped give nuremberg their first victory against bayern since may 1999 said that they had known that they had a chance to win . " we are doing well at the moment and we have seen some weaknesses in bayern , " he said .
" we made use of those . " for bayern , who have picked up just one point from their three first games of the second half of the season , it is the worst start after the winter break since 1975 . the result sees bayern remain in fourth place on 34 points , while nuremberg move two places to fifth with 30 points . one of the two leading clubs , werder bremen or schalke 04 who are currently on 42 points , could pull 11 points ahead of bayern on sunday .

the russian took the ball around goalkeeper oliver kahn and pushed it into the empty net . slovakian international robert vittek could have made it two a few minutes later , but saw his header hit the crossbar . a lot of work to be done hitzfeld brought on german striker lukas podolski as a third forward in an attempt to change his side 's fortune , but instead of scoring an equalizer , bayern found themselves two goals down when schroth scored his side 's second in the 71st with a close-range header . any chance bayern had of snatching an unexpected - and undeserved - draw were dashed four minutes from the end with a fine solo effort by vittek who played cat and mouse with the bayern defense before scoring with a right-footed shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg coach hans meyer enjoyed pulling down his bavarian rivals " it was disappointing to see how the team collapsed at the end of the game and to see how little confidence they had , " hitzfeld said .
" there is a lot of work that needs to be done . " nuremberg more confident scorer schroth , whose goal helped give nuremberg their first victory against bayern since may 1999 said that they had known that they had a chance to win . " we are doing well at the moment and we have seen some weaknesses in bayern , " he said .
" we made use of those . " for bayern , who have picked up just one point from their three first games of the second half of the season , it is the worst start after the winter break since 1975 . the result sees bayern remain in fourth place on 34 points , while nuremberg move two places to fifth with 30 points . one of the two leading clubs , werder bremen or schalke 04 who are currently on 42 points , could pull 11 points ahead of bayern on sunday .

" steinmeier , whose remarks were released a day ahead of publication on sunday , said he told rice the warrants could only be served in germany at present , but the government expected the court to issue international warrants at some stage . a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office said saturday that issuing international arrest warrants " was a formality . " a court in munich earlier this week issued 13 arrest warrants for false imprisonment against the cia suspects , accusing them of seizing khaled el-masri on suspicion of terrorism in 2003 .

" the timeframe appears favorable , " the chancellor said in her weekly internet video address , which coincided with the start of a four-nation tour of the middle east . merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidencies of the european union and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , arrived in cairo saturday afternoon for talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak on ways of breathing new life into the stalled mideast peace process .

" steinmeier , whose remarks were released a day ahead of publication on sunday , said he told rice the warrants could only be served in germany at present , but the government expected the court to issue international warrants at some stage . a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office said saturday that issuing international arrest warrants " was a formality . " a court in munich earlier this week issued 13 arrest warrants for false imprisonment against the cia suspects , accusing them of seizing khaled el-masri on suspicion of terrorism in 2003 .

for many of us , it was a must-have christmas present .

detective sergeant john agar from the force 's vehicle crime team explains : " thieves at the moment are using the latest technology , which can track a sat nav system even when it is n't on display in a vehicle .
" so , for example , if your car is parked up and the sat nav is locked in the glove compartment , thieves can still tell it is there and will break into your car for it . "
drivers are advised to adopt a three-point safety plan in order to ensure their sat nav is not the next one to be stolen : take it out of your car when you leave remove the suction pad from the windscreen hide the suction pad away and wipe your windscreen down .
thieves will often look for marks where the sat nav has been and break into the car to try to find it .

to try to keep up with the thieves , the police have organised a number of ' sting ' operations in which dummy devices are left in cars , and when the crooks try to steal them , they are caught red-handed .
this has worked well in manchester in a joint venture by the police and ncp car parks .
however , the authorities say the best person to stop the thief is the driver .
everyone should ensure that sat navs are not left in cars .

" so , for example , if your car is parked up and the sat nav is locked in the glove compartment , thieves can still tell it is there and will break into your car for it . "
drivers are advised to adopt a three-point safety plan in order to ensure their sat nav is not the next one to be stolen : take it out of your car when you leave remove the suction pad from the windscreen hide the suction pad away and wipe your windscreen down .
thieves will often look for marks where the sat nav has been and break into the car to try to find it .
even if you have taken your device away , you will still be faced with a broken car window .
police are also advising drivers to security mark their systems with their postcode , and also the registration number of their car , so if it does get stolen , it makes it easier for police to identify , and return to the owner .
according to a car crime survey last year on behalf of autoglass , sales of sat navs are heading towards six million .
it is a lucrative business with devices costing between £ 150 and £ 1,000 .
ambulances targetted on the black market , they are going for less than £ 100 but the thieves regard it as easy money , given how quickly they can steal them .
sat-navs are sold for a fraction of their value on the black market the most sickening aspect of this new crime wave is the targeting of ambulances .
the latest was on wednesday in tyneside .
the vehicle was forced off the road , while a replacement system was fitted .
to try to keep up with the thieves , the police have organised a number of ' sting ' operations in which dummy devices are left in cars , and when the crooks try to steal them , they are caught red-handed .
this has worked well in manchester in a joint venture by the police and ncp car parks .
however , the authorities say the best person to stop the thief is the driver .
everyone should ensure that sat navs are not left in cars .
in a nutshell , if in doubt , take it out .

drivers are advised to adopt a three-point safety plan in order to ensure their sat nav is not the next one to be stolen : take it out of your car when you leave remove the suction pad from the windscreen hide the suction pad away and wipe your windscreen down .
thieves will often look for marks where the sat nav has been and break into the car to try to find it .
even if you have taken your device away , you will still be faced with a broken car window .
police are also advising drivers to security mark their systems with their postcode , and also the registration number of their car , so if it does get stolen , it makes it easier for police to identify , and return to the owner .
according to a car crime survey last year on behalf of autoglass , sales of sat navs are heading towards six million .

during the summer motorists queued up to half-an-hour to cross pont briwet between penrhyndeudraeth and llandecwyn in gwynedd , say local people .
gwynedd county council said it was in discussion with network rail about a project to upgrade the crossing .
a public consultation is due to be held later this year .
pont briwet was built in 1860 .
motorists pay a toll to cross and save about eight miles -lrb- 12km -rrb- on their journey .
during the winter months around 300 cars pass over it daily , but in summer that swells to between 1,000 - 1,500 .
gwynedd councillor caerwyn roberts said a new crossing was desperately needed , but warned any plans would have to be suitable for future use .
" if we want to take on board the challenges in the future of sustainable transport and getting people to get on their bike and to walk , we need to make sure that we get a new bridge which will include a cycle path beside it , " he said . "
we are now evaluating long-term options for the structure " network rail spokesperson businesses in penrhydeudraeth said they feared they were losing customers during the summer because local people did not bother making the journey .
" we get a fair bit of trade from the ardudwy area but i know that some wo n't make the journey here during the summer because the problems are so bad , " said businessman dafydd jones .
a gwynedd county council spokesman said it had been looking at the feasibility of upgrading the crossing for some time , and was in discussion with network rail because the bridge also carried the cambrian coast railway .
a report was expected in april and the various options would then be shown to the public in a series of public exhibitions later in the year , the spokesman added .
a network rail spokesperson : " due to the scale of works on this bridge we have recently carried out short term repair works .
we are now evaluating long-term options for the structure . "
the welsh assembly government said it would consider funding for a new bridge if the council and taith -lrb- the north wales regional transport consortium -rrb- included such a project in their regional transport plan .

"
the ireland of those days was inured to brutality but there was something about these killings that shocked the dublin public " there is a cold hour just before dawn , when the light is the colour of lead , when the past seems a little closer and a lot more real than it does in the clearer light that comes later in the day .
the familiar signs of modern life have yet to seep back into the streets : the cars and buses , the tourists with ipods and the busy pedestrians with places to be .
dublin is still a city of graceful georgian terraces and , at this time of day , the scrubbed-pale stone staircases that sweep up from the street to the imposing front doors look just as they must have looked around this time in the last century .
to complete the illusion , the only sign of movement on the chilly landscape came from the frock-coated doorman of my hotel who is dressed , as is the way of it in such places , like a hapsburg dragoons officer .
i alone , heading for the sinn fein conference centre , struck a jarringly contemporary note , swaddled against the early morning cold in cheap , lumpy layers of fleece , like a scarecrow whose run of financial good fortune has come to an end .
there is a good chance i suppose that the morning of 21 november 1920 -lrb- the first " bloody sunday " -rrb- dawned in the same atmosphere of chilly damp - winter days in dublin often do .
shocking brutality on that day , ira gunmen burst into a string of houses that lay along my route to the conference centre and shot dead 14 british officers and intelligence officials .
the ireland of those days was inured to brutality on all sides but there was something about these killings that shocked the dublin public .
maybe it was the curiously pathetic fact that most of the victims were dragged from their beds and shot in their pyjamas .
more likely it was the story of how the pregnant wife of one of the officers had thrown herself on top of his wounded body in a vain attempt to save him .
she gave birth to a stillborn child a few days later .
it disclosed something of the underlying truth of guerrilla warfare too .
some of the ira gunmen were efficient and ruthless , others were too nervous to hit their intended targets with dozens of bullets fired inside a bedroom .
the killings were a shock to the british establishment too .
some of the victims were given a state funeral back in london at which both lloyd george and winston churchill followed the coffins .
they appear to have had less of an impact on some of the british officers actually serving in ireland .
general fp crozier , having helped direct clearing-up operations , went back to barracks , had a game of squash and a bath , and then took himself off to lunch , apparently in good spirits despite all the slaughter .
british reprisals and of course , the slaughter was not done .
britain had recruited two separate paramilitary forces in an attempt to crush the irish rebellion : the black and tans and the auxiliaries .
their ostensible role was to support the officers of the royal irish constabulary , mainly catholic irishmen of whom hundreds were to be murdered by the ira .
the real role of britain 's irregular forces was to meet murder with murder , or at least with violent reprisal .
a few hours after the british officials were killed , troops and police officers opened fire on the crowd at a gaelic football match in croke park , on the northside of dublin .
a further 14 people , some of them children , were killed .
and the point of all this ?
well , the part of dublin in which i found myself on that sunday morning - which once witnessed a terrifying step down the road to violence - was witnessing an important step towards peace .
sporting ties and in the same way , croke park - once the scene of one of the most disgraceful acts in this long and tortured story - is itself about to provide another little reminder of how hopeful are the times in which we live in ireland now .
while the national home of irish rugby is refurbished , football and rugby - long derided by lovers of gaelic sport as english-imposed " garrison games " - are to be played at croke park .
by chance , the english rugby team will be among the first visitors , and the incongruous sound of god save the queen will echo around a huge stadium which includes a terrace originally built from the rubble of dublin buildings destroyed by british shelling in 1916 .
if you happen to catch the game , there is a name to listen out for in the commentary .
not one of the players on the pitch , but a young man called michael hogan , who was the tipperary captain in the game being played on 21 november 1920 .
he was shot and killed on the field of play and one of the stands at croke park still bears his name .
that name - like the names of the graceful streets through which i walked to the sinn fein conference on my more recent sunday morning - are reminders of how ireland , as well as things between ireland and britain are turning out in a way that no-one who was alive in november 1920 could have dared to hope .
there was still a lot of suffering to go , of course , on both sides when the events of that first irish " bloody sunday " were done and much of it reaches into our present day but sometimes it is worth daring to reflect on how much things have changed here , and changed for the better .

the outbreak has been confirmed as the h5n1 strain of the virus which has infected 270 people , and killed 164 - most in south east asia - since 2003 .
however , the virus can not easily pass from human to human at present .
so far , all those who have been infected have been poultry workers who have come into intimate contact with infected birds . "
there is no immediate public health risk " dr colin butter institute for animal health experts warn that if the virus acquires the ability to pass from human to human , then it will pose a potential threat to millions across the globe .
health chiefs in the uk have warned that if such a modified strain does emerge then tens of thousands of people could die in britain alone .
however , at present h5n1 remains overwhelmingly a disease of birds , and not humans .
so at present the threat to human health from the outbreak in suffolk is minimal - particularly as it appears to have been rapidly contained .
asia is key dr colin butter , a bird flu expert at the institute for animal health , said : " this outbreak is no risk to the general public and will be controlled by culling . "
it is exceedingly unlikely that any human is going to get sick as a result of h5n1 in one turkey farm in britain at this time " dr david nabarro united nations " the risk to public health is from a human pandemic which is not likely to originate in europe .
" a pandemic of this type , if it does happen , is likely to occur in an area where people live side by side with birds , like in east asia .
" so there is no immediate public health risk , but this is clearly something we need to get under control . "
dr david nabarro , bird flu coordinator for the united nations , also stressed that h5n1 posed little threat to humans .
he said : " it is exceedingly unlikely that any human is going to get sick as a result of h5n1 in one turkey farm in britain at this time .
" the numbers of human cases are very , very small indeed , even though the virus has been moving through poultry in at least 50 countries in the last year , and led to millions of birds dying .
" this is really not a human disease , it is a poultry disease . "
farm workers peter kendall , president of the national farmers ' union , said the workers on the suffolk farm were also unlikely to be at risk .
he said poultry workers in south east asia effectively lived with their birds , and had far closer contact than any of their counterparts in the uk .
" on a modern poultry farm a lot of the feeding is done mechanically , and the involvement of the workers with the poultry is really minimalised . "
dr maria zambon , from the health protection agency , said farm workers who had come into contact with infected birds , and those involved in the culling process would be offered the anti-viral drug tamiflu as a precaution .
she stressed that nobody had developed symptoms of bird flu following similar outbreaks among farm birds in continental europe .
david catlow , president of the british veterinary association , said the department of environment , food and rural affairs had acted quickly to contain and isolate the outbreak .
he stressed that the public were safe to continue eating poultry .
virus mix the h5n1 virus is most likely to acquire the ability to pass easily from human to human if it mixes with a standard flu virus , and swaps genetic material .
this could happen if h5n1 infects a human - or other animal - which is already infected with standard flu .
to minimise the risk of this happening in the uk , the department of health recently announced that it would offer seasonal flu vaccine to poultry workers across england .
the theory is that if poultry workers are kept free of normal flu , then even in the highly unlikely event that they were infected with h5n1 , the bird flu virus would not come into contact with its cousin .

the outbreak has been confirmed as the h5n1 strain of the virus which has infected 270 people , and killed 164 - most in south east asia - since 2003 .
however , the virus can not easily pass from human to human at present .
so far , all those who have been infected have been poultry workers who have come into intimate contact with infected birds .
there is no immediate public health risk dr colin butter institute for animal health experts warn that if the virus acquires the ability to pass from human to human , then it will pose a potential threat to millions across the globe .
health chiefs in the uk have warned that if such a modified strain does emerge then tens of thousands of people could die in britain alone .
however , at present h5n1 remains overwhelmingly a disease of birds , and not humans .
so at present the threat to human health from the outbreak in suffolk is minimal - particularly as it appears to have been rapidly contained .
asia is key dr colin butter , a bird flu expert at the institute for animal health , said : " this outbreak is no risk to the general public and will be controlled by culling .
it is exceedingly unlikely that any human is going to get sick as a result of h5n1 in one turkey farm in britain at this time dr david nabarro united nations " the risk to public health is from a human pandemic which is not likely to originate in europe .
" a pandemic of this type , if it does happen , is likely to occur in an area where people live side by side with birds , like in east asia .
" so there is no immediate public health risk , but this is clearly something we need to get under control . "
dr david nabarro , bird flu coordinator for the united nations , also stressed that h5n1 posed little threat to humans .
he said : " it is exceedingly unlikely that any human is going to get sick as a result of h5n1 in one turkey farm in britain at this time .
" the numbers of human cases are very , very small indeed , even though the virus has been moving through poultry in at least 50 countries in the last year , and led to millions of birds dying .
" this is really not a human disease , it is a poultry disease . "
farm workers peter kendall , president of the national farmers ' union , said the workers on the suffolk farm were also unlikely to be at risk .
he said poultry workers in south east asia effectively lived with their birds , and had far closer contact than any of their counterparts in the uk .
" on a modern poultry farm a lot of the feeding is done mechanically , and the involvement of the workers with the poultry is really minimalised . "
dr maria zambon , from the health protection agency , said farm workers who had come into contact with infected birds , and those involved in the culling process would be offered the anti-viral drug tamiflu as a precaution .
she stressed that nobody had developed symptoms of bird flu following similar outbreaks among farm birds in continental europe .
david catlow , president of the british veterinary association , said the department of environment , food and rural affairs had acted quickly to contain and isolate the outbreak .
he stressed that the public were safe to continue eating poultry .
virus mix the h5n1 virus is most likely to acquire the ability to pass easily from human to human if it mixes with a standard flu virus , and swaps genetic material .
this could happen if h5n1 infects a human - or other animal - which is already infected with standard flu .
to minimise the risk of this happening in the uk , the department of health recently announced that it would offer seasonal flu vaccine to poultry workers across england .
the theory is that if poultry workers are kept free of normal flu , then even in the highly unlikely event that they were infected with h5n1 , the bird flu virus would not come into contact with its cousin .

cymdeithas yr iaith gymraeg says the bequest by howel vaughan lewis will secure its long-term financial future .
he left ceredigion when he was a boy and died at 87 in 2005 after building an estimated £ 4m fortune in london .
the society said the money would put it on a firm financial footing for at least the next decade .
cymdeithas ' governing body has been meeting in aberystwyth to discuss a shake-up of its campaigning and administrative structures after the windfall .
bbc wales ' maniffesto programme , broadcast on s4c , has learned the extent of the donation .
i do n't think there 's anything wrong in professionalising the society steffan cravos , chairman , cymdeithas yr iaith gymraeg after mr lewis died in march 2005 it emerged that he had left his entire estate to groups in wales , including plaid cymru , welsh youth movement urdd gobaith cymru , merched y wawr -lrb- a welsh language women 's group -rrb- and st gwenog 's church at llanwenog , where he grew up .
since it was formed in 1962 the society has largely relied on volunteers and member donations .
it employs two full-time members of staff .
cymdeithas told maniffesto it would consider employing a full-time lobbyist at the welsh assembly in an effort to professionalise the body , and recruit extra salaried officers in areas such as south-east wales .
however , it is likely to reject calls to invest in new offices or headquarters or appoint a chief executive to run the society on a day-to-day basis .
the society confirmed that it had already received " some of the money " but was awaiting details of the full amount , which it hoped to get soon .
chairman steffan cravos said : " i do n't think there 's anything wrong in professionalising the society - i think having a full-time lobbyist in the assembly is a good idea . "
maniffesto is on s4c at 1300 gmt on sunday .

the arrests follow evidence in a high-level us report that saudi arabia has been a source of funding for the insurgency in iraq .
nine saudis and a foreign national resident in the country were held in three raids in jeddah and medina .
it is unclear if the 10 have links to al-qaeda , the ministry said .
they were arrested for collecting money for " suspicious parties " .
warning an interior ministry statement said the money was being used to lure " the sons of the nation to disturbed places " , which correspondents say is probably a reference to neighbouring iraq .
seven of the saudis and the foreigner were arrested while meeting in jeddah on friday night .
the two other saudis were held in separate raids in jeddah and medina .
the nationality of the foreign detainee has not been released .
in recent years , saudi arabia has been responsible for a highly visible campaign to search out militants sympathetic to al-qaeda among its citizens .
the bbc 's julia wheeler in dubai says the saudi authorities are now keen to dispel the claims of the us iraq study group report that said saudi arabia has been a source of funding for the sunni insurgency in iraq .
the interior ministry issued a statement on 22 january warning against collecting money for unregistered organisations .
