what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

as a result , says the breeder , his lead male lost all interest in mating . 2006 was n't a good year for gustav , a resident of rico gabel 's ostrich farm near the saxon city of bautzen .
the poor fellow was allegedly so scared by some pre-new year 's eve festivities that he became temporarily indifferent to the opposite sex . gabel says that three teenage boys from the area set off fireworks near his farm between december 27 and 29 , 2005 .
in the first half of 2006 , the breeder complains , gustav suffered from apathy , depression and had a distinct lack of interest in siring any further progeny . and though gustav regained his previous form in the second half of last year , gabel remains hopping mad .
he 's suing the youths for 4,900 euros -lrb- $ 5500 -rrb- .
that 's 350 euros per chick for all the heirs that gabel claims his prize cock would have normally produced during his fallow period . a court is scheduled to hear the case on march 12 . quiet , please , during reproduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace and quiet are a must if you want eggs like one on the right unlike most birds , ostriches are polygamous , with males typically mating with a harem of two to five hens .
the huge , flightless creatures issue loud cries and do strange skipping dances , flapping and puffing out their wings , when trying to attract the attention of potential mothers . but although male ostriches make a lot of noise during their procreative rituals , they do n't appreciate loud sounds when it comes down to the act itself .
zoologists say the skittish giants immediately break off their courtship at the smallest disruption . but there is another aspect of ostrich reproduction that may work in favor of the defendants in the bautzen case . female and male ostriches take turns incubating eggs in communal nests - with males taking over the duty at night , when , due to their darker coloring , they are better concealed from potential predators . so gustav might not really have been impotent .
maybe he simply did n't want to get trapped into a life of staying at home and taking care of the kids . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german charged with lasciviousness after stripping in airport a german man has appeared in a philippines court charged with " alarm and scandal and acts of lasciviousness " after he dropped his trousers and walked through an x-ray machine at manila 's international airport .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .

huber added that receiving conscientious objection status by proving opposition to all wars is difficult but not the only way to leave the military . in addition to finding grounds for a medical discharge - often because of post-traumatic stress disorder - troops can also be discharged for being caught taking drugs , driving drunk , committing assault or claiming to be homosexual .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2007 " i want to play a harmonizer 's role " back to first page back 2/2 now coming to a very important issue : the topic of climate change .
there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable . " lewis said there was only one path to take - toward a world without nuclear weapons . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .

in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .
she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit .
-lrb- 05.03.2007 -rrb- germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .

there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

in the first half of 2006 , the breeder complains , gustav suffered from apathy , depression and had a distinct lack of interest in siring any further progeny . and though gustav regained his previous form in the second half of last year , gabel remains hopping mad .
he 's suing the youths for 4,900 euros -lrb- $ 5500 -rrb- .
that 's 350 euros per chick for all the heirs that gabel claims his prize cock would have normally produced during his fallow period . a court is scheduled to hear the case on march 12 . quiet , please , during reproduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace and quiet are a must if you want eggs like one on the right unlike most birds , ostriches are polygamous , with males typically mating with a harem of two to five hens .
the huge , flightless creatures issue loud cries and do strange skipping dances , flapping and puffing out their wings , when trying to attract the attention of potential mothers . but although male ostriches make a lot of noise during their procreative rituals , they do n't appreciate loud sounds when it comes down to the act itself .
zoologists say the skittish giants immediately break off their courtship at the smallest disruption . but there is another aspect of ostrich reproduction that may work in favor of the defendants in the bautzen case . female and male ostriches take turns incubating eggs in communal nests - with males taking over the duty at night , when , due to their darker coloring , they are better concealed from potential predators . so gustav might not really have been impotent .
maybe he simply did n't want to get trapped into a life of staying at home and taking care of the kids . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german charged with lasciviousness after stripping in airport a german man has appeared in a philippines court charged with " alarm and scandal and acts of lasciviousness " after he dropped his trousers and walked through an x-ray machine at manila 's international airport .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .
he was then sent back to würzburg to await trial . increase in conscientious objection inquires while it was aguayo in the dock on tuesday , many more of the 65,000 us soldiers in germany are also looking for ways to leave the military , especially in the wake of us president george w. bush 's january call for an increase in troop strength in iraq , according to tim huber of the military counseling network , which is based near a concentration of us bases in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aguayo was awol for 24 days before turning himself in outside los angeles " usually we average one call with interest in the conscientious objection discharge per month , " huber said .

" the displeasure with the war and how that can affect your look at all war and transform a solider into someone who no longer want to be a part of that is beginning to seep through some higher ranks , " said huber , adding that he had been contacted by sergeants and staff sergeants .

huber added that receiving conscientious objection status by proving opposition to all wars is difficult but not the only way to leave the military . in addition to finding grounds for a medical discharge - often because of post-traumatic stress disorder - troops can also be discharged for being caught taking drugs , driving drunk , committing assault or claiming to be homosexual .

he referred to caricatures depicting the mohammed that were originally published in a danish daily in september 2005 that sparked protests across the muslim world . german police had already supposed that the cartoons had triggered the bombing plot planned for july 31 , 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 06.03.2007 eu squarely divided on renewable energy targets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone 's for renewables , but the devil 's in the details european foreign ministers on monday could not agree on binding targets for the use of renewable energy .
european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .

jihad hamad said he had not intended to kill anyone .
rather , he wanted to issue a warning against insulting the muslim prophet mohammed . four lebanese men accused of involvement in a plot to blow up trains in germany last year are set to begin trial in lebanon on april 11 .
according to judicial sources , the main suspect , jihad hamad , has reiterated an earlier confession that he planted one of the explosives . during a pre-trial appearance in a beirut court on monday , hamad said his intentions " were not to kill , but to stop people from defaming the image of the prophet mohammed . "
he referred to caricatures depicting the mohammed that were originally published in a danish daily in september 2005 that sparked protests across the muslim world . german police had already supposed that the cartoons had triggered the bombing plot planned for july 31 , 2006 .

this region is a source of sunni fundamentalist groups who support the views of al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden . lebanese security sources said al-hajj dib and hamad , the two main suspects , have been influenced by the late al-qaeda chief in iraq , abu mussab al-zarqawi . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german suitcase bomber says mohammed cartoons set him off a lebanese man who has admitted plotting to bomb two trains in germany said in an interview that he and his accomplice were driven by the publication of cartoons featuring the prophet mohammed .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable . " lewis said there was only one path to take - toward a world without nuclear weapons . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

jihad hamad said he had not intended to kill anyone .
rather , he wanted to issue a warning against insulting the muslim prophet mohammed . four lebanese men accused of involvement in a plot to blow up trains in germany last year are set to begin trial in lebanon on april 11 .
according to judicial sources , the main suspect , jihad hamad , has reiterated an earlier confession that he planted one of the explosives . during a pre-trial appearance in a beirut court on monday , hamad said his intentions " were not to kill , but to stop people from defaming the image of the prophet mohammed . "
he referred to caricatures depicting the mohammed that were originally published in a danish daily in september 2005 that sparked protests across the muslim world . german police had already supposed that the cartoons had triggered the bombing plot planned for july 31 , 2006 .

this region is a source of sunni fundamentalist groups who support the views of al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden . lebanese security sources said al-hajj dib and hamad , the two main suspects , have been influenced by the late al-qaeda chief in iraq , abu mussab al-zarqawi . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german suitcase bomber says mohammed cartoons set him off a lebanese man who has admitted plotting to bomb two trains in germany said in an interview that he and his accomplice were driven by the publication of cartoons featuring the prophet mohammed .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable . " lewis said there was only one path to take - toward a world without nuclear weapons . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

jihad hamad said he had not intended to kill anyone .
rather , he wanted to issue a warning against insulting the muslim prophet mohammed . four lebanese men accused of involvement in a plot to blow up trains in germany last year are set to begin trial in lebanon on april 11 .
according to judicial sources , the main suspect , jihad hamad , has reiterated an earlier confession that he planted one of the explosives . during a pre-trial appearance in a beirut court on monday , hamad said his intentions " were not to kill , but to stop people from defaming the image of the prophet mohammed . "
he referred to caricatures depicting the mohammed that were originally published in a danish daily in september 2005 that sparked protests across the muslim world . german police had already supposed that the cartoons had triggered the bombing plot planned for july 31 , 2006 .

this region is a source of sunni fundamentalist groups who support the views of al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden . lebanese security sources said al-hajj dib and hamad , the two main suspects , have been influenced by the late al-qaeda chief in iraq , abu mussab al-zarqawi . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german suitcase bomber says mohammed cartoons set him off a lebanese man who has admitted plotting to bomb two trains in germany said in an interview that he and his accomplice were driven by the publication of cartoons featuring the prophet mohammed .

35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .
he was then sent back to würzburg to await trial . increase in conscientious objection inquires while it was aguayo in the dock on tuesday , many more of the 65,000 us soldiers in germany are also looking for ways to leave the military , especially in the wake of us president george w. bush 's january call for an increase in troop strength in iraq , according to tim huber of the military counseling network , which is based near a concentration of us bases in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aguayo was awol for 24 days before turning himself in outside los angeles " usually we average one call with interest in the conscientious objection discharge per month , " huber said .
" after bush 's speech in january we experienced a surge of about five times that number . " the calls are also coming from a wider range of troops than usual , he said , adding that while inquires mainly originated from low-ranking soldiers , the organization was beginning to hear from soldiers who tend to have spent between five and seven years in the military . " the displeasure with the war and how that can affect your look at all war and transform a solider into someone who no longer want to be a part of that is beginning to seep through some higher ranks , " said huber , adding that he had been contacted by sergeants and staff sergeants .
" we are obviously pleased with that and we are going to do everything we can to help those people . " others ways out of military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant ehren watada also refused to go to iraq with his unit and goes to trial in july but because the trials occur on us bases , and thus american territory , there is little actual help the german-based groups can give soldiers once courts-martial begin .
huber added that receiving conscientious objection status by proving opposition to all wars is difficult but not the only way to leave the military . in addition to finding grounds for a medical discharge - often because of post-traumatic stress disorder - troops can also be discharged for being caught taking drugs , driving drunk , committing assault or claiming to be homosexual . " there is also the awol option , going absent without leave , " huber said , adding that while his organization does not encourage this behavior , it does tell soldiers what could happen if they leave without official permission . drop in awol cases while it does not keep central statistics on desertion , a us department of defense spokesperson told reporters some 8,000 soldiers have been on unauthorized leave since the iraq war began in march 2003 .
about 3,500 of the cases occurred in 2005 ; there were about 8,000 cases of desertion in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 65,000 us troops in germany aguayo enlisted in 2002 - after the us had begun military action in afghanistan but before the iraq war - to save money for his education .
he approached the military counseling network in 2004 , just after he applied for conscientious objection status . aguayo 's appeal rejected in the months leading up to his first deployment to iraq , aguayo came to view himself as a conscientious objector , his wife told stars and stripes , an american military newspaper .
he applied for conscientious objector status in early 2004 and served with his unit in iraq - though he refused to load his weapons - while waiting for his request to be processed . aguayo knew there were other ways to be leave the army , said huber , adding that aguayo 's objection to war was sincere and that he only decided to go awol when his appeal was turned down and he was threatened with being forcibly returned to iraq for his second tour . " he had been trying so hard to follow the system , filing all these appeals , filing for conscientious objection discharge - just always doing everything and just being ignored , " huber said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu military chief wants strong links with un , au and nato the european union 's drive for a stronger global military role includes upgrading ties with the united nations , nato and the african union , the bloc 's top military official said on wednesday .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .
he was then sent back to würzburg to await trial . increase in conscientious objection inquires while it was aguayo in the dock on tuesday , many more of the 65,000 us soldiers in germany are also looking for ways to leave the military , especially in the wake of us president george w. bush 's january call for an increase in troop strength in iraq , according to tim huber of the military counseling network , which is based near a concentration of us bases in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aguayo was awol for 24 days before turning himself in outside los angeles " usually we average one call with interest in the conscientious objection discharge per month , " huber said .

huber added that receiving conscientious objection status by proving opposition to all wars is difficult but not the only way to leave the military . in addition to finding grounds for a medical discharge - often because of post-traumatic stress disorder - troops can also be discharged for being caught taking drugs , driving drunk , committing assault or claiming to be homosexual .

according to judicial sources , the main suspect , jihad hamad , has reiterated an earlier confession that he planted one of the explosives . during a pre-trial appearance in a beirut court on monday , hamad said his intentions " were not to kill , but to stop people from defaming the image of the prophet mohammed .

he referred to caricatures depicting the mohammed that were originally published in a danish daily in september 2005 that sparked protests across the muslim world . german police had already supposed that the cartoons had triggered the bombing plot planned for july 31 , 2006 .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

but that may be coming to an end amidst the political fallout from plans to cut 10,000 jobs in the company 's troubled airbus division . france stands to lose 4,300 jobs as a result of restructuring plans - and that in an election year .
so the country 's presidential candidates are lining up with promises to pump more cash into airbus and increase french influence on how the company is run . in a television interview on tuesday , conservative frontrunner nicolas sarkozy said that paris should intervene to prevent job losses , adding that eads needed a single hand at the helm .
" there needs to be a real shareholder , " sarkozy said , " who would be the industrial boss of the company and who decides on management , and we should stop this franco-german parity and just take the best people to take the best decisions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's main presidential candidates want to make political capital from the lay-offs sarkozy 's main rival for the french presidency , the socialist candidate segolene royal , said during a visit to berlin that french regions should buy stock in the company .
she has also said she would try to freeze the restructuring program . the first round of the presidential election is scheduled for april 22 .

unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

but that may be coming to an end amidst the political fallout from plans to cut 10,000 jobs in the company 's troubled airbus division . france stands to lose 4,300 jobs as a result of restructuring plans - and that in an election year .
so the country 's presidential candidates are lining up with promises to pump more cash into airbus and increase french influence on how the company is run . in a television interview on tuesday , conservative frontrunner nicolas sarkozy said that paris should intervene to prevent job losses , adding that eads needed a single hand at the helm .
" there needs to be a real shareholder , " sarkozy said , " who would be the industrial boss of the company and who decides on management , and we should stop this franco-german parity and just take the best people to take the best decisions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's main presidential candidates want to make political capital from the lay-offs sarkozy 's main rival for the french presidency , the socialist candidate segolene royal , said during a visit to berlin that french regions should buy stock in the company .
she has also said she would try to freeze the restructuring program . the first round of the presidential election is scheduled for april 22 .
thousands of french airbus employees went on strike on tuesday to protest the planned job cuts . shake-up at the very top ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and french airbus employees have held strikes in protest and it 's not just the candidates who are proposing a re-think of joint franco-german management structures .
members of the current french government are also calling the partnership in its current form into question . " if the state , together with other shareholders should get involved in raising more capital , " french prime minister dominique de villepin has said , " then we should take the opportunity to raise the question of the company 's leadership . " and in a radio interview on tuesday , french economics minister thierry breton was even more explicit about a possible end to franco-germany parity at eads , calling it a " mistake " and saying french interests should predominate . production delays to airbus ' flagship super-jumbo airplane a380 , caused in part by poor coordination between french and german plants , are costing eads billions of euros .
in february , the company announced the mandatory redundancies as part of its overall restructuring program . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus chiefs criticize power sharing and government meddling the french and german joint chiefs of troubled european plane maker eads , manufacturer of the airbus , saturday criticized the way their company was run , saying the double presidency they share added to the problems .

these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

but that may be coming to an end amidst the political fallout from plans to cut 10,000 jobs in the company 's troubled airbus division . france stands to lose 4,300 jobs as a result of restructuring plans - and that in an election year .
so the country 's presidential candidates are lining up with promises to pump more cash into airbus and increase french influence on how the company is run . in a television interview on tuesday , conservative frontrunner nicolas sarkozy said that paris should intervene to prevent job losses , adding that eads needed a single hand at the helm .
" there needs to be a real shareholder , " sarkozy said , " who would be the industrial boss of the company and who decides on management , and we should stop this franco-german parity and just take the best people to take the best decisions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's main presidential candidates want to make political capital from the lay-offs sarkozy 's main rival for the french presidency , the socialist candidate segolene royal , said during a visit to berlin that french regions should buy stock in the company .
she has also said she would try to freeze the restructuring program . the first round of the presidential election is scheduled for april 22 .
thousands of french airbus employees went on strike on tuesday to protest the planned job cuts . shake-up at the very top ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and french airbus employees have held strikes in protest and it 's not just the candidates who are proposing a re-think of joint franco-german management structures .
members of the current french government are also calling the partnership in its current form into question . " if the state , together with other shareholders should get involved in raising more capital , " french prime minister dominique de villepin has said , " then we should take the opportunity to raise the question of the company 's leadership . " and in a radio interview on tuesday , french economics minister thierry breton was even more explicit about a possible end to franco-germany parity at eads , calling it a " mistake " and saying french interests should predominate . production delays to airbus ' flagship super-jumbo airplane a380 , caused in part by poor coordination between french and german plants , are costing eads billions of euros .
in february , the company announced the mandatory redundancies as part of its overall restructuring program . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus chiefs criticize power sharing and government meddling the french and german joint chiefs of troubled european plane maker eads , manufacturer of the airbus , saturday criticized the way their company was run , saying the double presidency they share added to the problems .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .

as a result , says the breeder , his lead male lost all interest in mating . 2006 was n't a good year for gustav , a resident of rico gabel 's ostrich farm near the saxon city of bautzen .

in the first half of 2006 , the breeder complains , gustav suffered from apathy , depression and had a distinct lack of interest in siring any further progeny . and though gustav regained his previous form in the second half of last year , gabel remains hopping mad .

zoologists say the skittish giants immediately break off their courtship at the smallest disruption . but there is another aspect of ostrich reproduction that may work in favor of the defendants in the bautzen case . female and male ostriches take turns incubating eggs in communal nests - with males taking over the duty at night , when , due to their darker coloring , they are better concealed from potential predators . so gustav might not really have been impotent .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable .

the company said it hopes the rescue plan will save five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in costs over the next three years . royal said she and merkel were able to agree on the importance of protecting the european airline giant and that priority had to be given to the job concerns of employees as well as to efforts by management to ensure the company remains financially stable and productive . " we completely share the aim that europe must defend its aeronautical venture , " royal said . merkel added that it was important for governments " to understand the industrial challenges without intervening in the company 's economic direction " and said maintaining research facilities , particularly in the aviation sector , needed to play an important role in european policy . bildunterschrift : royal came to inform germany about her plans for the french presidency royal marks french environmental shift the chancellor also received the french candidate 's backing on increasing the eu 's use of renewable energies .
merkel wants 20 percent of the 27-member bloc 's energy to come from renewable sources by 2020 , a target royal supported . " germany is right to make this suggestion that the current administration in paris unfortunately does not support , " royal said . current french president jacques chirac 's government , however , is not alone in opposing merkel 's climate goals as half of the bloc 's foreign ministers monday said they were against setting mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions . the climate plan is on the agenda for a two-day summit of eu leaders beginning thursday in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french socialist would rather the eu have a treaty than a constitution royal faces conservative interior minister nicolas sarkozy in the may election to succeed president jacques chirac .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

jihad hamad said he had not intended to kill anyone .
rather , he wanted to issue a warning against insulting the muslim prophet mohammed . four lebanese men accused of involvement in a plot to blow up trains in germany last year are set to begin trial in lebanon on april 11 .
according to judicial sources , the main suspect , jihad hamad , has reiterated an earlier confession that he planted one of the explosives . during a pre-trial appearance in a beirut court on monday , hamad said his intentions " were not to kill , but to stop people from defaming the image of the prophet mohammed . "
he referred to caricatures depicting the mohammed that were originally published in a danish daily in september 2005 that sparked protests across the muslim world . german police had already supposed that the cartoons had triggered the bombing plot planned for july 31 , 2006 .
the bombs , hidden on regional trains in dortmund and koblenz , failed to explode due to detonator faults . suspected terrorists are all sunni fundamentalists hamad was arrested in lebanon on aug .

this region is a source of sunni fundamentalist groups who support the views of al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden . lebanese security sources said al-hajj dib and hamad , the two main suspects , have been influenced by the late al-qaeda chief in iraq , abu mussab al-zarqawi . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german suitcase bomber says mohammed cartoons set him off a lebanese man who has admitted plotting to bomb two trains in germany said in an interview that he and his accomplice were driven by the publication of cartoons featuring the prophet mohammed .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .

and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change .

as a result , says the breeder , his lead male lost all interest in mating . 2006 was n't a good year for gustav , a resident of rico gabel 's ostrich farm near the saxon city of bautzen .
the poor fellow was allegedly so scared by some pre-new year 's eve festivities that he became temporarily indifferent to the opposite sex . gabel says that three teenage boys from the area set off fireworks near his farm between december 27 and 29 , 2005 .
in the first half of 2006 , the breeder complains , gustav suffered from apathy , depression and had a distinct lack of interest in siring any further progeny . and though gustav regained his previous form in the second half of last year , gabel remains hopping mad .
he 's suing the youths for 4,900 euros -lrb- $ 5500 -rrb- .
that 's 350 euros per chick for all the heirs that gabel claims his prize cock would have normally produced during his fallow period . a court is scheduled to hear the case on march 12 . quiet , please , during reproduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace and quiet are a must if you want eggs like one on the right unlike most birds , ostriches are polygamous , with males typically mating with a harem of two to five hens .
the huge , flightless creatures issue loud cries and do strange skipping dances , flapping and puffing out their wings , when trying to attract the attention of potential mothers . but although male ostriches make a lot of noise during their procreative rituals , they do n't appreciate loud sounds when it comes down to the act itself .
zoologists say the skittish giants immediately break off their courtship at the smallest disruption . but there is another aspect of ostrich reproduction that may work in favor of the defendants in the bautzen case . female and male ostriches take turns incubating eggs in communal nests - with males taking over the duty at night , when , due to their darker coloring , they are better concealed from potential predators . so gustav might not really have been impotent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 06.03.2007 eu squarely divided on renewable energy targets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone 's for renewables , but the devil 's in the details european foreign ministers on monday could not agree on binding targets for the use of renewable energy .
european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there .

the pair agreed to " defend " airbus and that europe is in need of a new industrial policy . france 's socialist candidate for president , royal said she agreed with merkel that europe needed to increase industrial cooperation . " europe has to do everything possible to define a shared industrial policy , " she said after a meeting with merkel on tuesday .
she was in berlin for one day to present her presidency plans should she win the spring election and become france 's first female president . airbus key point in talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus announced it restructuring plans last week proposed job cuts at airbus have been a recent sticking point in franco-german relations , as more than 10,000 employees took to the streets in toulouse , the company 's french headquarters , on tuesday to protest the plans that could see some 4,300 jobs in france slashed and another 3,700 cut in germany .
the company said it hopes the rescue plan will save five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in costs over the next three years . royal said she and merkel were able to agree on the importance of protecting the european airline giant and that priority had to be given to the job concerns of employees as well as to efforts by management to ensure the company remains financially stable and productive . " we completely share the aim that europe must defend its aeronautical venture , " royal said . merkel added that it was important for governments " to understand the industrial challenges without intervening in the company 's economic direction " and said maintaining research facilities , particularly in the aviation sector , needed to play an important role in european policy . bildunterschrift : royal came to inform germany about her plans for the french presidency royal marks french environmental shift the chancellor also received the french candidate 's backing on increasing the eu 's use of renewable energies .
merkel wants 20 percent of the 27-member bloc 's energy to come from renewable sources by 2020 , a target royal supported . " germany is right to make this suggestion that the current administration in paris unfortunately does not support , " royal said . current french president jacques chirac 's government , however , is not alone in opposing merkel 's climate goals as half of the bloc 's foreign ministers monday said they were against setting mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions . the climate plan is on the agenda for a two-day summit of eu leaders beginning thursday in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french socialist would rather the eu have a treaty than a constitution royal faces conservative interior minister nicolas sarkozy in the may election to succeed president jacques chirac .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .
he was then sent back to würzburg to await trial . increase in conscientious objection inquires while it was aguayo in the dock on tuesday , many more of the 65,000 us soldiers in germany are also looking for ways to leave the military , especially in the wake of us president george w. bush 's january call for an increase in troop strength in iraq , according to tim huber of the military counseling network , which is based near a concentration of us bases in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aguayo was awol for 24 days before turning himself in outside los angeles " usually we average one call with interest in the conscientious objection discharge per month , " huber said .
" after bush 's speech in january we experienced a surge of about five times that number . " the calls are also coming from a wider range of troops than usual , he said , adding that while inquires mainly originated from low-ranking soldiers , the organization was beginning to hear from soldiers who tend to have spent between five and seven years in the military . " the displeasure with the war and how that can affect your look at all war and transform a solider into someone who no longer want to be a part of that is beginning to seep through some higher ranks , " said huber , adding that he had been contacted by sergeants and staff sergeants .
" we are obviously pleased with that and we are going to do everything we can to help those people . " others ways out of military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant ehren watada also refused to go to iraq with his unit and goes to trial in july but because the trials occur on us bases , and thus american territory , there is little actual help the german-based groups can give soldiers once courts-martial begin .
huber added that receiving conscientious objection status by proving opposition to all wars is difficult but not the only way to leave the military . in addition to finding grounds for a medical discharge - often because of post-traumatic stress disorder - troops can also be discharged for being caught taking drugs , driving drunk , committing assault or claiming to be homosexual . " there is also the awol option , going absent without leave , " huber said , adding that while his organization does not encourage this behavior , it does tell soldiers what could happen if they leave without official permission . drop in awol cases while it does not keep central statistics on desertion , a us department of defense spokesperson told reporters some 8,000 soldiers have been on unauthorized leave since the iraq war began in march 2003 .
about 3,500 of the cases occurred in 2005 ; there were about 8,000 cases of desertion in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 65,000 us troops in germany aguayo enlisted in 2002 - after the us had begun military action in afghanistan but before the iraq war - to save money for his education .
he approached the military counseling network in 2004 , just after he applied for conscientious objection status . aguayo 's appeal rejected in the months leading up to his first deployment to iraq , aguayo came to view himself as a conscientious objector , his wife told stars and stripes , an american military newspaper .
he applied for conscientious objector status in early 2004 and served with his unit in iraq - though he refused to load his weapons - while waiting for his request to be processed . aguayo knew there were other ways to be leave the army , said huber , adding that aguayo 's objection to war was sincere and that he only decided to go awol when his appeal was turned down and he was threatened with being forcibly returned to iraq for his second tour . " he had been trying so hard to follow the system , filing all these appeals , filing for conscientious objection discharge - just always doing everything and just being ignored , " huber said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu military chief wants strong links with un , au and nato the european union 's drive for a stronger global military role includes upgrading ties with the united nations , nato and the african union , the bloc 's top military official said on wednesday .

the huge , flightless creatures issue loud cries and do strange skipping dances , flapping and puffing out their wings , when trying to attract the attention of potential mothers . but although male ostriches make a lot of noise during their procreative rituals , they do n't appreciate loud sounds when it comes down to the act itself .
zoologists say the skittish giants immediately break off their courtship at the smallest disruption . but there is another aspect of ostrich reproduction that may work in favor of the defendants in the bautzen case . female and male ostriches take turns incubating eggs in communal nests - with males taking over the duty at night , when , due to their darker coloring , they are better concealed from potential predators . so gustav might not really have been impotent .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2007 " i want to play a harmonizer 's role " back to first page back 2/2 now coming to a very important issue : the topic of climate change .
there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2007 " i want to play a harmonizer 's role " back to first page back 2/2 now coming to a very important issue : the topic of climate change .
there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2007 " i want to play a harmonizer 's role " back to first page back 2/2 now coming to a very important issue : the topic of climate change .
there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2007 " i want to play a harmonizer 's role " back to first page back 2/2 now coming to a very important issue : the topic of climate change .
there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .
he was then sent back to würzburg to await trial . increase in conscientious objection inquires while it was aguayo in the dock on tuesday , many more of the 65,000 us soldiers in germany are also looking for ways to leave the military , especially in the wake of us president george w. bush 's january call for an increase in troop strength in iraq , according to tim huber of the military counseling network , which is based near a concentration of us bases in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aguayo was awol for 24 days before turning himself in outside los angeles " usually we average one call with interest in the conscientious objection discharge per month , " huber said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2007 " i want to play a harmonizer 's role " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south korean diplomat wants to build trust within the un united nations secretary general ban ki-moon spoke to deutsche welle about his plans for the global body , germany 's role in the un and the current conflict over iran 's nuclear program . deutsche welle : you have been in office for two months now .
what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .

i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .

unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .

as a result , says the breeder , his lead male lost all interest in mating . 2006 was n't a good year for gustav , a resident of rico gabel 's ostrich farm near the saxon city of bautzen .
the poor fellow was allegedly so scared by some pre-new year 's eve festivities that he became temporarily indifferent to the opposite sex . gabel says that three teenage boys from the area set off fireworks near his farm between december 27 and 29 , 2005 .
in the first half of 2006 , the breeder complains , gustav suffered from apathy , depression and had a distinct lack of interest in siring any further progeny . and though gustav regained his previous form in the second half of last year , gabel remains hopping mad .
he 's suing the youths for 4,900 euros -lrb- $ 5500 -rrb- .
that 's 350 euros per chick for all the heirs that gabel claims his prize cock would have normally produced during his fallow period . a court is scheduled to hear the case on march 12 . quiet , please , during reproduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace and quiet are a must if you want eggs like one on the right unlike most birds , ostriches are polygamous , with males typically mating with a harem of two to five hens .
the huge , flightless creatures issue loud cries and do strange skipping dances , flapping and puffing out their wings , when trying to attract the attention of potential mothers . but although male ostriches make a lot of noise during their procreative rituals , they do n't appreciate loud sounds when it comes down to the act itself .
zoologists say the skittish giants immediately break off their courtship at the smallest disruption . but there is another aspect of ostrich reproduction that may work in favor of the defendants in the bautzen case . female and male ostriches take turns incubating eggs in communal nests - with males taking over the duty at night , when , due to their darker coloring , they are better concealed from potential predators . so gustav might not really have been impotent .
maybe he simply did n't want to get trapped into a life of staying at home and taking care of the kids . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german charged with lasciviousness after stripping in airport a german man has appeared in a philippines court charged with " alarm and scandal and acts of lasciviousness " after he dropped his trousers and walked through an x-ray machine at manila 's international airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 06.03.2007 eu squarely divided on renewable energy targets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone 's for renewables , but the devil 's in the details european foreign ministers on monday could not agree on binding targets for the use of renewable energy .
european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2007 " i want to play a harmonizer 's role " back to first page back 2/2 now coming to a very important issue : the topic of climate change .
there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

as a result , says the breeder , his lead male lost all interest in mating . 2006 was n't a good year for gustav , a resident of rico gabel 's ostrich farm near the saxon city of bautzen .
the poor fellow was allegedly so scared by some pre-new year 's eve festivities that he became temporarily indifferent to the opposite sex . gabel says that three teenage boys from the area set off fireworks near his farm between december 27 and 29 , 2005 .
in the first half of 2006 , the breeder complains , gustav suffered from apathy , depression and had a distinct lack of interest in siring any further progeny . and though gustav regained his previous form in the second half of last year , gabel remains hopping mad .
he 's suing the youths for 4,900 euros -lrb- $ 5500 -rrb- .

zoologists say the skittish giants immediately break off their courtship at the smallest disruption . but there is another aspect of ostrich reproduction that may work in favor of the defendants in the bautzen case . female and male ostriches take turns incubating eggs in communal nests - with males taking over the duty at night , when , due to their darker coloring , they are better concealed from potential predators . so gustav might not really have been impotent .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .
he was then sent back to würzburg to await trial . increase in conscientious objection inquires while it was aguayo in the dock on tuesday , many more of the 65,000 us soldiers in germany are also looking for ways to leave the military , especially in the wake of us president george w. bush 's january call for an increase in troop strength in iraq , according to tim huber of the military counseling network , which is based near a concentration of us bases in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aguayo was awol for 24 days before turning himself in outside los angeles " usually we average one call with interest in the conscientious objection discharge per month , " huber said .
" after bush 's speech in january we experienced a surge of about five times that number . " the calls are also coming from a wider range of troops than usual , he said , adding that while inquires mainly originated from low-ranking soldiers , the organization was beginning to hear from soldiers who tend to have spent between five and seven years in the military . " the displeasure with the war and how that can affect your look at all war and transform a solider into someone who no longer want to be a part of that is beginning to seep through some higher ranks , " said huber , adding that he had been contacted by sergeants and staff sergeants .

huber added that receiving conscientious objection status by proving opposition to all wars is difficult but not the only way to leave the military . in addition to finding grounds for a medical discharge - often because of post-traumatic stress disorder - troops can also be discharged for being caught taking drugs , driving drunk , committing assault or claiming to be homosexual . " there is also the awol option , going absent without leave , " huber said , adding that while his organization does not encourage this behavior , it does tell soldiers what could happen if they leave without official permission . drop in awol cases while it does not keep central statistics on desertion , a us department of defense spokesperson told reporters some 8,000 soldiers have been on unauthorized leave since the iraq war began in march 2003 .

he applied for conscientious objector status in early 2004 and served with his unit in iraq - though he refused to load his weapons - while waiting for his request to be processed . aguayo knew there were other ways to be leave the army , said huber , adding that aguayo 's objection to war was sincere and that he only decided to go awol when his appeal was turned down and he was threatened with being forcibly returned to iraq for his second tour .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable . " lewis said there was only one path to take - toward a world without nuclear weapons . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable . " lewis said there was only one path to take - toward a world without nuclear weapons . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .
he was then sent back to würzburg to await trial . increase in conscientious objection inquires while it was aguayo in the dock on tuesday , many more of the 65,000 us soldiers in germany are also looking for ways to leave the military , especially in the wake of us president george w. bush 's january call for an increase in troop strength in iraq , according to tim huber of the military counseling network , which is based near a concentration of us bases in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aguayo was awol for 24 days before turning himself in outside los angeles " usually we average one call with interest in the conscientious objection discharge per month , " huber said .

" the displeasure with the war and how that can affect your look at all war and transform a solider into someone who no longer want to be a part of that is beginning to seep through some higher ranks , " said huber , adding that he had been contacted by sergeants and staff sergeants .

huber added that receiving conscientious objection status by proving opposition to all wars is difficult but not the only way to leave the military . in addition to finding grounds for a medical discharge - often because of post-traumatic stress disorder - troops can also be discharged for being caught taking drugs , driving drunk , committing assault or claiming to be homosexual . " there is also the awol option , going absent without leave , " huber said , adding that while his organization does not encourage this behavior , it does tell soldiers what could happen if they leave without official permission . drop in awol cases while it does not keep central statistics on desertion , a us department of defense spokesperson told reporters some 8,000 soldiers have been on unauthorized leave since the iraq war began in march 2003 .

he approached the military counseling network in 2004 , just after he applied for conscientious objection status . aguayo 's appeal rejected in the months leading up to his first deployment to iraq , aguayo came to view himself as a conscientious objector , his wife told stars and stripes , an american military newspaper .
he applied for conscientious objector status in early 2004 and served with his unit in iraq - though he refused to load his weapons - while waiting for his request to be processed . aguayo knew there were other ways to be leave the army , said huber , adding that aguayo 's objection to war was sincere and that he only decided to go awol when his appeal was turned down and he was threatened with being forcibly returned to iraq for his second tour .

but that may be coming to an end amidst the political fallout from plans to cut 10,000 jobs in the company 's troubled airbus division . france stands to lose 4,300 jobs as a result of restructuring plans - and that in an election year .
so the country 's presidential candidates are lining up with promises to pump more cash into airbus and increase french influence on how the company is run . in a television interview on tuesday , conservative frontrunner nicolas sarkozy said that paris should intervene to prevent job losses , adding that eads needed a single hand at the helm .
" there needs to be a real shareholder , " sarkozy said , " who would be the industrial boss of the company and who decides on management , and we should stop this franco-german parity and just take the best people to take the best decisions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's main presidential candidates want to make political capital from the lay-offs sarkozy 's main rival for the french presidency , the socialist candidate segolene royal , said during a visit to berlin that french regions should buy stock in the company .
she has also said she would try to freeze the restructuring program . the first round of the presidential election is scheduled for april 22 .
thousands of french airbus employees went on strike on tuesday to protest the planned job cuts . shake-up at the very top ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and french airbus employees have held strikes in protest and it 's not just the candidates who are proposing a re-think of joint franco-german management structures .
members of the current french government are also calling the partnership in its current form into question . " if the state , together with other shareholders should get involved in raising more capital , " french prime minister dominique de villepin has said , " then we should take the opportunity to raise the question of the company 's leadership . " and in a radio interview on tuesday , french economics minister thierry breton was even more explicit about a possible end to franco-germany parity at eads , calling it a " mistake " and saying french interests should predominate . production delays to airbus ' flagship super-jumbo airplane a380 , caused in part by poor coordination between french and german plants , are costing eads billions of euros .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.03.2007 " i want to play a harmonizer 's role " back to first page back 2/2 now coming to a very important issue : the topic of climate change .
there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .

then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .

jihad hamad said he had not intended to kill anyone .
rather , he wanted to issue a warning against insulting the muslim prophet mohammed . four lebanese men accused of involvement in a plot to blow up trains in germany last year are set to begin trial in lebanon on april 11 .
according to judicial sources , the main suspect , jihad hamad , has reiterated an earlier confession that he planted one of the explosives . during a pre-trial appearance in a beirut court on monday , hamad said his intentions " were not to kill , but to stop people from defaming the image of the prophet mohammed . "
he referred to caricatures depicting the mohammed that were originally published in a danish daily in september 2005 that sparked protests across the muslim world . german police had already supposed that the cartoons had triggered the bombing plot planned for july 31 , 2006 .

this region is a source of sunni fundamentalist groups who support the views of al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden . lebanese security sources said al-hajj dib and hamad , the two main suspects , have been influenced by the late al-qaeda chief in iraq , abu mussab al-zarqawi . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german suitcase bomber says mohammed cartoons set him off a lebanese man who has admitted plotting to bomb two trains in germany said in an interview that he and his accomplice were driven by the publication of cartoons featuring the prophet mohammed .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there .

a conference in berlin aims to breath new life into existing disarmament treaties . when the cold war ended , a new world order was supposed to emerge - one marked by cooperation rather than confrontation .
many thought the world would become a place where peace would reign and the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction would be confined to the scrap heap of history . hans blix , the former chief united nations weapons inspector in iraq , said at an international conference in berlin this week that the recipe for a better and safer world was still there . " humankind has not become any kinder or wiser , but greater proximity between nations and their accelerating interdependence are factors that make effective multilateral cooperation in disarmament indispensable and inevitable , " blix said at the meeting being held in berlin on monday and tuesday . but new threats to regional and global peace had emerged , he said , especially after the terrorist attacks on the united states and the increasing number of countries who are achieving or aspiring to nuclear power status . more important now than ever a question heatedly discussed at the conference , which is being hosted by germany 's foreign office , was whether or not multilateral treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- were still relevant today . patricia lewis , head of the united nations disarmament institute , said she believed they were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has refused to freeze iran 's nuclear program " in a world of uncertainty , one of the things we have to fall back on is the rule of law and norms that have been set , " lewis said .
" these treaties form that framework and have given us a structure to work within in these uncertain times . " lewis said the importance of such treaties had increased rather than decreased . however , she said their relevance depended on the fact that all major political players in the world were united in their goals .
the us-led war in iraq , participants said , as well as china 's recent shooting down of a satellite in outer space were examples that indicated that national interests still prevailed . eu has to pull together peter stania from the international institute for peace in vienna criticized the fact that not even the european union was able to show unity among its members . " it 's not only that britain has special interests , france as well has a different position , and germany is trying to play a more united european card , " stania said .
" as long as we march divided , we will not have disarmament and less conflicts . " over the past decade , reviews of existing disarmament treaties have revealed an bleak picture .
iran , pakistan and north korea have violated the npt ; the united states continues to defy a ban on nuclear testing ; and a treaty banning the development of chemical and biological weapons is under permanent threat from a number of countries . even so , lewis said she was confident that the issue of global disarmament would soon make a comeback on the world political stage .
even a problem such as iran 's nuclear ambitions could be resolved , she said . " i 'm actually very optimistic , " lewis said .
" i think if you imagine that the world can continue having five states that are allowed to possess nuclear weapons and no one else , then that is unsustainable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 06.03.2007 eu squarely divided on renewable energy targets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone 's for renewables , but the devil 's in the details european foreign ministers on monday could not agree on binding targets for the use of renewable energy .
european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .
she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit .

european leaders will hash out the issue at an upcoming eu summit later this week . the summit 's host , german chancellor angela merkel is preparing for divisive negotiations on thursday and friday .
merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has made energy policy a top priority .
a number of ambitious proposals would position europe as the global frontrunner in the fight against radical climate change . while eu members have endorsed some of the proposals put forward by the german presidency , others have been met with determined resistance .
at a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels on monday , member states agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 .
this target will likely be legally binding . but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who chaired the meeting with his european colleagues , said that " no breakthrough was possible " on the question of how much energy should be supplied from renewable and nuclear sources .
" it will have to be debated at the european council " later this week , he said . 50-50 split on the nuclear issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , center , in brussels with javier solana , left , and eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner diplomats in brussels said the 27-member european union was split squarely down the middle .
germany , sweden , denmark , britain , spain and italy have voiced strong support for a binding target of 20 percent of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . on the other side , france has been the most vocal critic of the renewable energy targets , but may accept a binding agreement if nuclear energy is included in the mix .
poland , finland , luxembourg and bulgaria also expressed doubts about the binding nature of the targets , warning against setting unreachable goals on member states . " that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .

" that 's going to be the key issue " at thursday 's summit , steinmeier said . germany has one of europe 's leading renewable energy industries , with an extensive network of wind turbines , solar and hydro-electric plants .
the german government plans to phase out its nuclear reactors .
meanwhile , france relies heavily on nuclear energy , and is worried that the renewable targets could jeopardize its national energy mix . " renewable energies are important , they must be developed and france is well placed to do that , but it is not enough to achieve our own goals , " french european affairs minister catherine colonna told the afp news agency . atomic energy reactors emit very little carbon dioxide gas , but pose other environmental problems .
uranium fuel rods , necessary for nuclear energy production , are costly and hazardous to dispose of when spent , and there is always a small chance of a nuclear meltdown .
in many eu countries , therefore , public opinion is strongly anti-nuclear . europe leading the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us produces one-fourth of the world 's co2 emissions europe - and germany in particular - has expressed its desire to put in place the world 's most progressive energy policies , leading the way for other nations in the global effort to mitigate the effects of global warming . european member states have agreed on a 10 percent increase in bio-fuels – such as ethanol gained from corn crops – over the next three years .
and germany has already achieved close to a 20 percent national reduction of its co2 levels compared to 1990 . but at times , the eu has struggled to agree on a common approach , as member states tend to put national interests first .
according to german chancellor merkel , this is all about to change . " so far , european nations have made their own energy policy , " she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday , but " all that is now up for negotiation " at the upcoming eu summit . meanwhile , other industrialized nations are falling behind what climate experts say is a necessary global reduction of greenhouse gases .
in the united states , a bush administration report to the united nations estimates that instead of reducing us emissions by 2020 , they will actually rise to 20 percent above 2000 levels .
a copy of the document , whose publication has been delayed for over a year , was obtained by the associated press on monday . and in britain , a recent independent scientific audit of british climate change policies described the government 's projections as " overly optimistic . " the german presidency is an opportunity for chancellor merkel to get other industrialized nations , as well as developing countries , to make solid commitments for a cleaner future .
but the divisions in the run-up to this week 's eu summit are only a taste of the difficulties that lie ahead of merkel 's ambitious green crusade . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .
there -lsb- were -rsb- very intensive discussions among the member states , but unfortunately member states have not been able to agree on single formula .
as secretary general , i 'll try to facilitate on the basis of objectivity and impartiality to facilitate such ongoing consultations , so that this will be done in a most representative and democratic way . and again what kind of role can germany play in this unification ? germany is a very important country .
this is the third-largest of financial contributing countries ; it has been participating in many activities of the united nations - peace and security as well as developmental strategies .
germany should try to expand in the areas of understandings and support among the member states for their goals of -lsb- becoming -rsb- a member of the security council .

what was different than you expected ? ban ki-moon : like my predecessor as secretary general , the last two months have been extremely busy .
i have been trying to have this house in order , and i have realized that there are much more conflict issues than i have thought and the world is much wider than i have thought .
i have been very much humbled by all the challenges lying before me .
but i 'm confident that with all help and cooperation from member states , i 'll be able to discharge my duties as secretary general . you said that the united nations is not united but divided , so what will you do to unite the united nations ? that is one of my top priorities , to restore trust and gain trust among member states .
unfortunately , we have seen mistrust among the member states , between big and small , between rich and poor countries , and there is some widespread mistrust again between member states and the secretariat .
as a secretary general , i try to play a harmonizer 's role to bridge the gap . but how will you balance the interests , as you mentioned , of the developing countries and the other countries , for example , with the united states of america not very confident about the united nations ? the united states and united nation 's partnership is very important .
as secretary general , i would hope that i can expect very active and strong participation of the united states .
the united states and united nations , in fact share the same goals , objectives , peace and security , and harmony and development and human rights and the promotion of democracy .
these are the same goals which we are trying to achieve , and therefore i 'm confident that the united states will participate .
they 're a very active member state . how important do you think the united nations is today ? united nations is the only universal global body working for peace and security and human rights and democracy .
this is an inter-governmental body of 192 member states .
this is center of multilateralism working for peace and security of the world .
we need to nurture this only global body so that it can work more -lsb- efficiently -rsb- and effectively for our global body . you said that reforms are necessary .
will there be a reform of the security council during your term and what kind of role would you like germany to play in it ? reform of the security council , considering the dramatic changes in international political scenes , is necessary .
in fact , there is no doubt that the security council should be expanded .
but how to expand and who should join as prominent member states of the security council , that is the core of this reform agenda of the security council .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .
we need the collective and common efforts to address all these challenges of the international community . christina bergmann interviewed ban ki-moon -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key powers mull response to iran 's latest nuclear snub six key world powers grappling to contain iran 's nuclear ambitions gathered for talks monday on how to increase pressure on tehran , after the islamic republic 's latest defiant snub to its critics .

there is no way to prevent global warming - that 's what the experts say - there 's only a chance to moderate the extent .
how do you plan to get involved in this topic ? science tells that humankind 's activity has been mostly responsible for this global warming .
this is a global issue , therefore we need global action , common actions .
big and small countries ' and even social , civil societies ' participation is very much necessary .
as secretary general of the united nations , i will try to generate the political will so that the whole international community can take seriously - and urgently - measures to prepare beyond 2012 , when the kyoto protocol will expire .
the recent release of an intergovernmental panel report on climate change was a strong reminder that the international community must take urgent action on this . but what will you expect from countries like the united states which have so far not cooperated in the international efforts to prevent global warming ? i have a sense that even in the united states there is some growing awareness , within the united states , particularly in business communities and the american congress , that it is a very important issue and the united states should also take part in this very important process .
i would hope that the united states government will seriously consider more actively and constructively participating in this process . coming to the topic of the continent of africa : somalia and darfur are only two trouble spots .
where do you see the most urgent need for the united nations to react ? the united nations has been discussing with the members of the african union to , first of all , bring political dialog with the sudanese government and also to deploy african union / un hybrid peacekeeping operations .
we have been trying to also deliver humanitarian assistance to many refugees .
it is said that there are about 4 million people in darfur who are suffering from these difficulties .
and in somalia , i have been also urging the somali government to have some promotion of national reconciliation .
president -lsb- abdullahi -rsb- yusuf has called to convene a national reconciliation congress .
it is an encouraging sign and the african union has decided to praise amisom - the african mission in somalia .
we hope that the international community will provide necessary funding to amisom operations there . coming to another hotspot : how should the international community proceed in the conflict with iran ? first of all , the iranian authorities must comply with the security council resolution completely .
it was regrettable that they have not met the deadlines set out by the security council to stop enriching uranium facilities .
it is in the hands of the security council .
i understand that member states of the security council are now seriously considering to take further sanction measures .
even at this time , i would sincerely appeal and urge the iranian authorities to engage in a dialog with the international community led by the european union . what do you expect from the united states ?
what kind of role do you expect the us to play in that conflict ? the united states has been also indirectly participating in this negotiation with the iranians .
they are also a member of p5 -lsb- editor 's note : the five permanent members of the un security council -rsb- .
last week p5 together with the europeans held very serious negotiations with the iranian government .
we hope that the iranians will continue in their negotiations on this matter . what are the three most important goals you would like to achieve during the next five years ? first the priority is to get the house in order through management reform , to make this organization more relevant and more efficient and effective .
i 'd like to make this organization more accountable and transparent in discharging their work .
then secondly , i 'd like to devote my time and energy in seeing smooth implementation of millennium development goals by 2015 .
of course my third priority - but that does not mean in terms of preference - but another goal or priority will be in helping resolve all regional conflicts which unfortunately we are facing in many parts of the world , particularly in africa .
this needs collective responses and cooperation from the international community .
no one country or no individual can do it alone .

as a result , says the breeder , his lead male lost all interest in mating . 2006 was n't a good year for gustav , a resident of rico gabel 's ostrich farm near the saxon city of bautzen .
the poor fellow was allegedly so scared by some pre-new year 's eve festivities that he became temporarily indifferent to the opposite sex . gabel says that three teenage boys from the area set off fireworks near his farm between december 27 and 29 , 2005 .
in the first half of 2006 , the breeder complains , gustav suffered from apathy , depression and had a distinct lack of interest in siring any further progeny . and though gustav regained his previous form in the second half of last year , gabel remains hopping mad .
he 's suing the youths for 4,900 euros -lrb- $ 5500 -rrb- .
that 's 350 euros per chick for all the heirs that gabel claims his prize cock would have normally produced during his fallow period . a court is scheduled to hear the case on march 12 . quiet , please , during reproduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace and quiet are a must if you want eggs like one on the right unlike most birds , ostriches are polygamous , with males typically mating with a harem of two to five hens .
the huge , flightless creatures issue loud cries and do strange skipping dances , flapping and puffing out their wings , when trying to attract the attention of potential mothers . but although male ostriches make a lot of noise during their procreative rituals , they do n't appreciate loud sounds when it comes down to the act itself .

he was sentenced on tuesday to eight months in jail .
a us military court also ruled that mexican-born combat medic agustin aguayo , who has already spent 161 days behind bars , should forfeit paid allowances and be given a bad conduct discharge .
his rank would also be reduced to the lowest grade .
35-year-old aguayo had pleaded guilty to going absent without leave and missing his deployment , but denied charges of full desertion .
colonel peter masterton , the military judge at the court-marital in würzburg , germany , sided with prosecutors , though , in finding him guilty of the more severe charge of desertion . aguayo lost an appeal for a military discharge as a conscientious objector after returning from a one-year tour in iraq in 2004 .
aguayo , stationed in the german city of schweinfurt , proceeded to sneak out a bathroom window in september to avoid being sent back to iraq for a second deployment . he was absent without leave for 24 days before he turned himself in at an army training center in california .
he was then sent back to würzburg to await trial . increase in conscientious objection inquires while it was aguayo in the dock on tuesday , many more of the 65,000 us soldiers in germany are also looking for ways to leave the military , especially in the wake of us president george w. bush 's january call for an increase in troop strength in iraq , according to tim huber of the military counseling network , which is based near a concentration of us bases in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aguayo was awol for 24 days before turning himself in outside los angeles " usually we average one call with interest in the conscientious objection discharge per month , " huber said .
" after bush 's speech in january we experienced a surge of about five times that number . " the calls are also coming from a wider range of troops than usual , he said , adding that while inquires mainly originated from low-ranking soldiers , the organization was beginning to hear from soldiers who tend to have spent between five and seven years in the military . " the displeasure with the war and how that can affect your look at all war and transform a solider into someone who no longer want to be a part of that is beginning to seep through some higher ranks , " said huber , adding that he had been contacted by sergeants and staff sergeants .
" we are obviously pleased with that and we are going to do everything we can to help those people . " others ways out of military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieutenant ehren watada also refused to go to iraq with his unit and goes to trial in july but because the trials occur on us bases , and thus american territory , there is little actual help the german-based groups can give soldiers once courts-martial begin .
huber added that receiving conscientious objection status by proving opposition to all wars is difficult but not the only way to leave the military . in addition to finding grounds for a medical discharge - often because of post-traumatic stress disorder - troops can also be discharged for being caught taking drugs , driving drunk , committing assault or claiming to be homosexual . " there is also the awol option , going absent without leave , " huber said , adding that while his organization does not encourage this behavior , it does tell soldiers what could happen if they leave without official permission . drop in awol cases while it does not keep central statistics on desertion , a us department of defense spokesperson told reporters some 8,000 soldiers have been on unauthorized leave since the iraq war began in march 2003 .
about 3,500 of the cases occurred in 2005 ; there were about 8,000 cases of desertion in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 65,000 us troops in germany aguayo enlisted in 2002 - after the us had begun military action in afghanistan but before the iraq war - to save money for his education .
he approached the military counseling network in 2004 , just after he applied for conscientious objection status . aguayo 's appeal rejected in the months leading up to his first deployment to iraq , aguayo came to view himself as a conscientious objector , his wife told stars and stripes , an american military newspaper .
he applied for conscientious objector status in early 2004 and served with his unit in iraq - though he refused to load his weapons - while waiting for his request to be processed . aguayo knew there were other ways to be leave the army , said huber , adding that aguayo 's objection to war was sincere and that he only decided to go awol when his appeal was turned down and he was threatened with being forcibly returned to iraq for his second tour . " he had been trying so hard to follow the system , filing all these appeals , filing for conscientious objection discharge - just always doing everything and just being ignored , " huber said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu military chief wants strong links with un , au and nato the european union 's drive for a stronger global military role includes upgrading ties with the united nations , nato and the african union , the bloc 's top military official said on wednesday .

north wales race equality network said the number of migrant workers in wales could be five to 10 times higher than the official figure of 12,670 .
half of the local education authorities in wales also say welsh assembly government grants to teach non-english speaking pupils do not cover costs .
the assembly government said it was examining funding for language needs .
in the latest accession monitoring report for may 2004 - september 2006 , 12,670 migrant workers were registered in wales .
manu patiar , chair of north wales race equality network , told bbc wales ' week in week out programme these official figures were unreliable because the information they were compiled from was not detailed enough .
" all we have to go by is the national insurance number , or the worker registration scheme , " she said .
" they do provide some statistics , but what they do n't provide is where these migrant ethnic communities come from ...
which nationality , which local area do they work in ?
i do n't need to really go back to poland because i 've got my mum here and sister , and family now , so my family is here , my home is here karolina blaszskiewicz " so , i mean , even the sort of figure you are quoting , the numbers could be five or 10 times higher , it 's hard to say . "
wrexham local authority told the programme the figure of polish migrant workers in their area was anything between 4,000 and 15,000 , but the lack of clarity on figures was a problem for the whole of the uk .
aled roberts , leader of wrexham council called for a more strategic approach at national level to the issue .
" it is n't just a problem for wrexham , i think it 's a problem for the whole uk because it 's quite clear there are no means of recording migrant workers , " he said .
" we 're coping well , but there 's pressure on certain services - we had in excess of 80 children register from outside the uk in our schools in september , 50 were from poland . "
in a statement , the assembly said it was in the process of commissioning research to provide more accurate estimates of migrant workers in wales .
it admitted the figure of 12,670 registered workers may not include self-employed workers , who are not required to register with the workers registration scheme in wales .
wojciech blaszskiewicz is one of thousands of polish migrants one polish couple who first arrived in wales in 2004 , have decided to stay on .
wojciech and karolina blaszskiewicz , who now have a baby , julia , said they will stay in wrexham .
" i do n't need to really go back to poland because i 've got my mum here and sister , and family now , so my family is here , my home is here , " said mrs blaszskiewicz .
education costs week in , week out also reports that welsh assembly government education grants to teach newly-arrived non-english speaking pupils , do not cover the actual cost of staff needed in half of the local education authorities in wales .
in a statement , the assembly government said funding for staff in this area had increased by over £ 1m since 2004 , to a total of £ 5m .
but they recognised the number of migrant workers from the eu coming to wales in the near future was set to increase , and were looking at finding additional funding to support their language needs .
week in week out is broadcast at 2235 gmt on bbc one wales on tuesday , 6 march .

rapid industrialisation is driving increases in the " asian haze " here , rapid industrialisation has led to the formation of a pollution haze which is especially marked in winter as coal burning increases .
sulphur emissions have increased by more than one-third over the last decade .

deep convective clouds play a key role in regulating the global climate ; and the role of aerosols in cloud development remains the major uncertainty in forecasting climate change .

but the link between clouds and aerosols works in the opposite direction too .
clouds transport the tiny particles , and more abundant and persistent clouds will transport them further - even to polar regions , professor zhang suggests .
some studies have suggested that accumulation of these particles is changing the properties of arctic ice , making it absorb more of the sun 's energy .
this would mean the ice is more prone to melting , as well as reducing the earth 's capacity to reflect solar energy back into space .

at this year 's geneva motor show , which begins this week , they will be speaking of little else .
car manufacturers are under pressure from the european commission to deliver more environmentally-friendly models .
they also know that the way to win over new customers is via their wallets .
cheap and green so the answer is to come up with a car that is cheap to run and is also clean and green .
volkswagen 's response to this agenda - albeit one which vw says has been in development for several years - is the polo bluemotion .
the firm has backed diesel rather than the hybrid petrol / electric technology favoured by rivals .
the bluemotion , it says , will deliver more than 70 miles to the gallon - a figure which should deliver more than 700 miles from its 45-litre diesel tank .
from germany to london but it has to be said when the bbc drove the car , the range was rather less than that .
we took the car from vw 's headquarters at wolfsburg in northern germany to bbc television centre in west london - a distance of 566 miles - on a single tank of diesel .
the in-car fuel management system had predicted that we would run out at around 630 miles .
vw pointed out that we had been driving constantly on motorways at 70 mph or so , not the most fuel-efficient form of driving .
big investment at £ 12,000 or more , the bluemotion , due to be launched in the uk later this year , wo n't come cheap .
but dirk pesditschek , one of the design team leaders , believes the low running costs will be the priority for most drivers .
" if the mileage is high enough , you can for sure reduce the total cost of the car with the lowest running costs for this model , " he says .
the company says the fuel economy starts with a high-tech turbodiesel engine .
aerodynamics tested at vw 's wind tunnel in wolfsburg boost the car 's efficiency , as do low-resistance tyres .
hybrid rivals vw 's central claim for its new baby is an even greener performance than the hybrids .
the bluemotion is said to emit 102 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre .
this is below the toyota prius at 104g / km and the honda civic hybrid at 109 .
vw 's competitors , however , counter with the argument that diesels produce other damaging pollutants , known as particulates .
honda is putting more eggs into the hybrid basket by developing a lower-cost model .
" by 2009 , we will bring out a purpose-built small hybrid - and a smaller hybrid equals an even cheaper hybrid , making the technology more accessible to a wider market , " says honda 's john kingston .
green debate and so the green debate will continue .
hybrids have hogged headlines , particularly the toyota prius .
but diesel-powered volkswagen is coming up in the outside lane .
it 's now up to the customer to dictate whether can overtake its green rivals .

a panel of politicians monitoring government policy has given its views on the sale .
treasury minister terry le sueur has proposed the business should be sold in its entirety - raising about £ 200m for the states .
but the economic affairs scrutiny panel believes the company 's position in the telecom market is healthy and has called for a more considered approach .
if it was sold , the panel said the states should not lose complete control over the future direction of the business - disagreeing with mr le sueur 's proposal .
the chairman deputy geoff southern said the panel has suggested careful consideration was given to the option of a partnership , perhaps backed by a partial sale of shares in the company .
the company currently employs 437 staff in jersey and 37 workers in guernsey .
the sale is opposed by the union which represents the islands ' workers and objectors who fear it could result in a private monopoly .
the scrutiny panel wants a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis before the states makes a final decision .
if the sale does go ahead , the money raised would be put in the states rainy-day fund for emergencies .

at this year 's geneva motor show , which begins this week , they will be speaking of little else .
car manufacturers are under pressure from the european commission to deliver more environmentally-friendly models .
they also know that the way to win over new customers is via their wallets .
cheap and green so the answer is to come up with a car that is cheap to run and is also clean and green .
volkswagen 's response to this agenda - albeit one which vw says has been in development for several years - is the polo bluemotion .
the firm has backed diesel rather than the hybrid petrol / electric technology favoured by rivals .
the bluemotion , it says , will deliver more than 70 miles to the gallon - a figure which should deliver more than 700 miles from its 45-litre diesel tank .
from germany to london but it has to be said when the bbc drove the car , the range was rather less than that .
we took the car from vw 's headquarters at wolfsburg in northern germany to bbc television centre in west london - a distance of 566 miles - on a single tank of diesel .
the in-car fuel management system had predicted that we would run out at around 630 miles .
vw pointed out that we had been driving constantly on motorways at 70 mph or so , not the most fuel-efficient form of driving .
big investment at £ 12,000 or more , the bluemotion , due to be launched in the uk later this year , wo n't come cheap .
but dirk pesditschek , one of the design team leaders , believes the low running costs will be the priority for most drivers .
" if the mileage is high enough , you can for sure reduce the total cost of the car with the lowest running costs for this model , " he says .
the company says the fuel economy starts with a high-tech turbodiesel engine .
aerodynamics tested at vw 's wind tunnel in wolfsburg boost the car 's efficiency , as do low-resistance tyres .
hybrid rivals vw 's central claim for its new baby is an even greener performance than the hybrids .
the bluemotion is said to emit 102 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre .
this is below the toyota prius at 104g / km and the honda civic hybrid at 109 .
vw 's competitors , however , counter with the argument that diesels produce other damaging pollutants , known as particulates .
honda is putting more eggs into the hybrid basket by developing a lower-cost model .
" by 2009 , we will bring out a purpose-built small hybrid - and a smaller hybrid equals an even cheaper hybrid , making the technology more accessible to a wider market , " says honda 's john kingston .
green debate and so the green debate will continue .
hybrids have hogged headlines , particularly the toyota prius .
but diesel-powered volkswagen is coming up in the outside lane .
it 's now up to the customer to dictate whether can overtake its green rivals .

a panel of politicians monitoring government policy has given its views on the sale .
treasury minister terry le sueur has proposed the business should be sold in its entirety - raising about £ 200m for the states .
but the economic affairs scrutiny panel believes the company 's position in the telecom market is healthy and has called for a more considered approach .
if it was sold , the panel said the states should not lose complete control over the future direction of the business - disagreeing with mr le sueur 's proposal .
the chairman deputy geoff southern said the panel has suggested careful consideration was given to the option of a partnership , perhaps backed by a partial sale of shares in the company .
the company currently employs 437 staff in jersey and 37 workers in guernsey .
the sale is opposed by the union which represents the islands ' workers and objectors who fear it could result in a private monopoly .
the scrutiny panel wants a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis before the states makes a final decision .
if the sale does go ahead , the money raised would be put in the states rainy-day fund for emergencies .

"
sunday night and it 's like preparing for the first day back at school .
bag ready ? check .
enough pens ? check .
clothes out ? check .
homework done ? check .
then i make sure the alarm - well alarms , all three of them , just in case - are set 15 minutes early .
after top gear , it was lights out and fast asleep ..
at least , that was the plan .
but you know if you 've got an early flight to catch and you spend all night clock-watching ?
exactly .
so at 3.45 , i was already awake .
and had spent so much time tossing and turning , my hair was all over the place and i had bags the size of suitcases .
into the office .
no cheery welcome from security - just a gruff " where 's your pass ? " .
try to log in to my computer and find i 've been locked out .
realise i 've lost my earpiece and my earrings .
head into make-up to read my programme briefs and whisper " do your best .. i think i 'll need a bit of help today " .
but then - at 5.45 - when i walk into the studio - the gallery plays out a huge round of applause from their effects cd and what sounds like the theme tune from rocky .
a hug from the director .
a cup of tea from the floor manager .
a big hug from dermot and at 6am , we 're off .
it felt wonderful to be back and should have been very familiar after six years on the sofa .
most of it was , and regular coffees with dermot kept me up to date .
but i still spend most of the three hours asking " which camera ? " or " where 's the guest ? "
i ca n't find the clock when i 'm giving a time-check , i get the newspapers muddled up and i have already lost all those programme briefs .
the thing that keeps me sane are the messages from our viewers , so many lovely e-mails and texts simply saying , " welcome back " .
give it a few weeks and i 'm sure there 'll be a few saying , go away again !
for those who sent their best wishes , thank you very , very much .
it really helped settle me back in and steady my nerves .
i hope you can bear with me over the next few days , it could be a bumpy ride while i find my feet again but thanks for making my 1st day back a real pleasure .

then i make sure the alarm - well alarms , all three of them , just in case - are set 15 minutes early .
after top gear , it was lights out and fast asleep ..
at least , that was the plan .
but you know if you 've got an early flight to catch and you spend all night clock-watching ?
exactly .
so at 3.45 , i was already awake .
and had spent so much time tossing and turning , my hair was all over the place and i had bags the size of suitcases .
into the office .
no cheery welcome from security - just a gruff " where 's your pass ? " .

head into make-up to read my programme briefs and whisper " do your best .. i think i 'll need a bit of help today " .
but then - at 5.45 - when i walk into the studio - the gallery plays out a huge round of applause from their effects cd and what sounds like the theme tune from rocky .
a hug from the director .
a cup of tea from the floor manager .
a big hug from dermot and at 6am , we 're off .
it felt wonderful to be back and should have been very familiar after six years on the sofa .
most of it was , and regular coffees with dermot kept me up to date .
but i still spend most of the three hours asking " which camera ? " or " where 's the guest ? "
i ca n't find the clock when i 'm giving a time-check , i get the newspapers muddled up and i have already lost all those programme briefs .
the thing that keeps me sane are the messages from our viewers , so many lovely e-mails and texts simply saying , " welcome back " .

i hope you can bear with me over the next few days , it could be a bumpy ride while i find my feet again but thanks for making my 1st day back a real pleasure .

bbc news -pipe- school report -pipe- news story ideas for 22 march bbc news / school report graphics version bbc sport home tuesday , 6 march 2007 , 10:03 gmt news story ideas for 22 march as school report news day on 22 march approaches , you might want to consider some topics and events that you can cover on the day .
news planning plays a very important role in journalism .
preparing for upcoming events allows you time to do your research , put in calls to people you might like to interview , decide what pictures to use and write your script .
in many cases you can prepare all of these before the day , giving you time to concentrate on reporting news breaking on 22 march .
this is what bbc journalists do .
our daily news programmes are a mixture of news reports that have been made that day and features which have been created in advance .
next time you are watching , listening or reading the news , see if you can spot which is which .
below are some ideas for events and topics about which you could prepare news items .
smoking ban banning smoking in public places is a topic which is frequently in the news .
useful links while many people are in favour of a smoking ban , some oppose it because they believe it will harm their business , or because they think it infringes on their human rights .
scotland imposed a smoking ban on 26 march 2006 , two years after one was introduced in the irish republic .
in wales , a ban is due to come into force on 2 april this year , around the same time that one is expected to be introduced in northern ireland .
in england , the smoking ban will come into force on 1 july 2007 .
a ban was also implemented in france on 1 february this year .
you might like to investigate the different sides to the argument or look at how the smoking bans might affect businesses or residents in your area .
the budget - why bother ?
chancellor gordon brown is due to present the budget on 21 march .
you will find a large amount of media coverage on the day , so it is important you understand what the budget is and how it might affect you .
the budget , which comes out every year , is the government 's plan on how to obtain money and distribute it across the country .
useful links this means deciding how to spend money on areas such as schools , the army , the nhs , pensions , the police and housing .
the government also has to announce how it will get the money to pay for these things , which is usually through different types of taxes .
although the budget may seem complicated at first , it does affect everyone living in the uk , including young people .
for example , the government might change the amount it spends on schools , or local youth schemes .
on 21 march you will find a lot of reports in newspapers , news websites , radio and tv analysing what mr brown announces .
you might also like to ask a teacher or your parents what the budget will mean for you and your area .
if you decide to cover the budget in your school report news , you could try interviewing someone in your area about it , such as a local mp , a business owner or even your own teachers .
bicentenary of the abolition of slavery useful links the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites march 25 2007 marks the 200th anniversary of the passing of the parliamentary act to abolish the british slave trade .

lord browne 's total pay package fell to £ 4.57m -lrb- $ 8.79m -rrb- down 28 % from 2005 , as bp suffered problems including oil spills and safety fears .
the pay cut contrasts with an increase of 15 % in the company 's full-year profits , to $ 22.3bn.
the news came as bp said it , and its partners , plan to invest $ 2bn to build a pipeline off vietnam 's south coast .
bp declined to reveal the names of its partners in the project , but did say the pipeline would deliver gas to power plants onshore from two new gas fields .
the company currently operates vietnam 's only operational pipeline , which supplies 13.2 million cubic metres of gas a day .
details of lord browne 's pay settlement were revealed in the oil giant 's annual review .
operational woes according to the report , mr brown 's salary and bonus payments came in at £ 2.5m , down from £ 3.3m last year .
the value of shares awarded to lord browne under an incentive scheme also fell to £ 2m from £ 3.1m in 2005 .
it was the second year that the chief 's pay has fallen , following problems in 2005 .
that year an explosion at the company 's texas city refinery killed 15 people and injured 180 , as well as causing huge damage .
in january , an independent us report into the blast found that while bp emphasised personal safety , it was weak on process safety .
the firm has also faced criticism for leaks last year at its alaskan operations , delays on starting up some key projects also affected bp 's performance , eroding lord browne 's wages as a result of a drop in share prices .
bp shares have fallen 10.87 % over the past year .
news of lord browne 's pay deal come months ahead of his early departure from the company .
lord browne will step down from his post in july - after 12 years at the helm of bp - and be succeeded by tony hayward , who is currently head of exploration and production at bp .

the value of shares awarded to lord browne under an incentive scheme also fell to £ 2m from £ 3.1m in 2005 .
it was the second year that the chief 's pay has fallen , following problems in 2005 .
that year an explosion at the company 's texas city refinery killed 15 people and injured 180 , as well as causing huge damage .
in january , an independent us report into the blast found that while bp emphasised personal safety , it was weak on process safety .
the firm has also faced criticism for leaks last year at its alaskan operations , delays on starting up some key projects also affected bp 's performance , eroding lord browne 's wages as a result of a drop in share prices .
bp shares have fallen 10.87 % over the past year .
news of lord browne 's pay deal come months ahead of his early departure from the company .
lord browne will step down from his post in july - after 12 years at the helm of bp - and be succeeded by tony hayward , who is currently head of exploration and production at bp .

he was speaking after japan 's prime minister shinzo abe caused controversy last week by questioning whether women were " coerced " into sexual slavery .
mr abe has said japan will not go beyond a 1993 apology on the issue .
many historians say japan compelled up to 200,000 women , mostly chinese and korean , to become sex slaves .
but some japanese scholars deny that force was used to round up the women , blaming private contractors for any abuses .
us congress debate mr li told a press conference in beijing that the treatment of so-called comfort women " is one of the serious crimes committed by the japanese militarists in world war ii " .
" this is a historical fact , " he stressed .
it was not as though military police broke into peoples ' homes and took them away like kidnappers japanese pm shinzo abe " i believe the japanese government should face up to this part of history , take responsibility , seriously view and properly handle this issue , " he added .
south korean foreign minister song min-soon has already described mr abe 's remarks as " not helpful " .
the us house of representatives is currently considering a non-binding resolution calling on tokyo to " formally acknowledge , apologise and accept historical responsibility " for the treatment of the women .
the draft text was debated last week , and three former comfort women gave evidence , describing the rape and torture they endured at the hands of the japanese soldiers .
mr abe last week appeared to side with revisionists when he said there was " no evidence to prove there was coercion " .
li zhaoxing : the treatment of comfort women was a serious crime he commented again on the issue on monday , saying that while there was no evidence of coercion in the strict sense , there may be some evidence of independent brokers procuring women by force .
but " it was not as though military police broke into peoples ' homes and took them away like kidnappers , " he said .
he also indicated that japan would not issue another apology on the issue , even if washington asked for one .
threatened rapprochement mr abe said he stood by a 1993 japanese government apology , which acknowledged that the military set up and ran brothels for its troops during the war .
many former comfort women are still seeking compensation from the japanese government for their experiences .
tokyo did set up a compensation fund in 1995 , but it relies on private donations rather than government money .
the issue of the comfort women could harm a recent rapprochement between japan and its asian neighbours , china and south korea .
relations have been tense in recent years , in part because of disagreements over japan 's wartime past , but since taking office late last year mr abe has sought to improve ties .

he was speaking after japan 's prime minister shinzo abe caused controversy last week by questioning whether women were " coerced " into sexual slavery .
mr abe has said japan will not go beyond a 1993 apology on the issue .
many historians say japan compelled up to 200,000 women , mostly chinese and korean , to become sex slaves .
but some japanese scholars deny that force was used to round up the women , blaming private contractors for any abuses .
us congress debate mr li told a press conference in beijing that the treatment of so-called comfort women " is one of the serious crimes committed by the japanese militarists in world war ii " .
" this is a historical fact , " he stressed .
it was not as though military police broke into peoples ' homes and took them away like kidnappers japanese pm shinzo abe " i believe the japanese government should face up to this part of history , take responsibility , seriously view and properly handle this issue , " he added .
south korean foreign minister song min-soon has already described mr abe 's remarks as " not helpful " .
the us house of representatives is currently considering a non-binding resolution calling on tokyo to " formally acknowledge , apologise and accept historical responsibility " for the treatment of the women .
the draft text was debated last week , and three former comfort women gave evidence , describing the rape and torture they endured at the hands of the japanese soldiers .
mr abe last week appeared to side with revisionists when he said there was " no evidence to prove there was coercion " .
li zhaoxing : the treatment of comfort women was a serious crime he commented again on the issue on monday , saying that while there was no evidence of coercion in the strict sense , there may be some evidence of independent brokers procuring women by force .
but " it was not as though military police broke into peoples ' homes and took them away like kidnappers , " he said .
he also indicated that japan would not issue another apology on the issue , even if washington asked for one .
threatened rapprochement mr abe said he stood by a 1993 japanese government apology , which acknowledged that the military set up and ran brothels for its troops during the war .
many former comfort women are still seeking compensation from the japanese government for their experiences .
tokyo did set up a compensation fund in 1995 , but it relies on private donations rather than government money .
the issue of the comfort women could harm a recent rapprochement between japan and its asian neighbours , china and south korea .

road pricing proposals have provoked a storm of protest but what is the alternative in easing congestion ?
downing street 's website may have melted under the 1.8 million petitioners opposed to the government 's national road pricing scheme for dealing with congestion .
traffic in central london has fallen but how would the petitioners stop the uk from being the most extensively traffic congested country in europe ?
many argue for the traditional " predict and provide " approach to traffic growth : more road building , more parking and removing bus lanes .
but are these credible alternatives to dealing with our insatiable desire to drive more vehicles more frequently to more places ?
indeed , there is credible evidence that such measures only exacerbate congestion by inducing extra traffic .
certainly the decline of public transport - especially the bus in rural areas - has made people much more car dependent , a trend exacerbated by planning support for some out-of-town developments and the government 's " big is beautiful " approach to the closure of thousands of post offices , scores of hospitals and hundreds of police stations , not to mention the scarcity of school buses .
pricing pluses but people have also become hooked on unnecessary car use .
the department for transport says a quarter of journeys under two miles are by car which may explain why in the last decade , the number of walking trips per person fell from 292 to 245 and why there are now more households with at least two cars than with no car .
we 're going to have a transport system to rival the best in europe john prescott , 1997 the anti-road pricers make no mention of the pluses of road pricing claimed in the recent treasury commissioned study by former ba chief sir rod eddington : congestion cut by half , £ 28bn a year benefits to bus and rail users .
unless demand is controlled , by 2025 the dft forecasts that car use will grow by 40 % .
computer modelling suggests that will double the time we spend in congested traffic .
all this is a very far cry from john prescott 's vision in 1997 in which he said he would regard himself as having failed had he not reduced car use within five years .
the clear message was : our rapid growth in hyper mobility was unsustainable and major road projects were put on hold .
in december 1999 mr prescott promised : " we 're going to have a transport system to rival the best in europe " -lrb- only to telephone a senior official the next day for the facts and figures about how far behind europe our transport system was -rrb- .
but the following year his 10-year plan for transport restored the emphasis on mobility and revived road building .
motorists were promised traffic could grow whilst congestion would be reduced by up to 6 % by 2010 .
" the arithmetic did n't add up " said professor phil goodwin , a key prescott adviser .
" the more traffic there is , the slower it goes .
it 's a fundamental law of traffic but it looked for a while as if the government had found a way to abolish it . "
square one mr prescott did get powers for local authorities to introduce congestion charging at their discretion - provided they got approval from ministers .
but a later transport minister john spellar tried to sabotage london mayor ken livingstone 's plans to introduce the congestion charge .
the 10-year plan was effectively laid to rest within two years by the then transport secretary alastair darling announcing a 20 % rise in congestion by 2010 rather than the 6 % reduction that had been promised .
he also announced a new £ 3bn roads scheme : " the government is listening to motorists and is committed to getting our roads moving again . "
now the government has returned to where they started when they took office : that it 's never going to be possible for road building to keep pace with traffic growth and that the only way to control that is through pricing .
reductions in traffic will hit public transport disproportionately road pricing trials will take place in several urban areas in about five years , although the dft appears to have excluded the most congested sections of the strategic road network from these trials .
meanwhile , their target for reducing congestion - a 3.6 % increase in journey time in the 10 largest urban areas by 2010-11 - is a " weak ambition " says the transport committee .
road pricing , anyway , will not be " the silver bullet " which eliminates congestion .
the public transport system will need to be hugely expanded .
a 5 % reduction in road traffic may equate to a 50 % increase in demand for bus and rail services .
to absorb this extra demand - and ahead of the road pricing - public transport will need to be much more attractive .
but by 2005 in real terms bus and coach fares were 42 % and rail fares 39 % higher than in 1980 whereas the overall cost of motoring is 9 % below 1980 levels .
as it is the dft is well adrift from its 2010 target to increase public transport by 12 % compared with 2000 levels in every region of england , a target which itself displays a " lack of ambition " says the transport committee .
" are we there yet ? " on the roads ?
answer : " not yet " and at this rate " perhaps never " .
are we there yet ? was on bbc two on tuesday , 6 march , 2007 at 1930 gmt .
add your comments on this story , using the form below .
i support it .
i rarely drive but i punished with high road tax .
public transport needs to improve though in terms of network and price .
where i grew up in oxfordshire the last bus was at 7pm .
i saved all my money for a car from when i was 16 so i could be able to see my friends .
where my parent live now it cost £ 2.80 for a single bus journy of 6 miles .
people that live outside of big towns do have an option with poor and expensive servies .
the road prices need to target the right areas .
tom , london why do we all think we have an automatic right to a driving licence ?
rather than let the government sell off the right to use the roads to their rich croneys -lrb- tax and tax again until only the super rich can afford it -rrb- why not tackle the problem at source .
there are too many vehicles and too many people wanting to drive them .
if we had a cap on the number of driving licences issued we could increase standards .
lose your licence through bad driving and you 'll have to go to the back of the queue .
a driving licence should become a treasured qualification rather than an automatic right .
steve brindle , wimbledon , london , uk i work 35 miles from where i live , travelling round the m25 every day , i want to move closer but it would cost about 10k to move into a house of similar price to the one i am in -lrb- but difference in prices would mean that it would be smaller -rrb- .
a serious alternative would be to help people move to reduce congestion - the money charged should be made available to people who would want move to cover fees and stamp duty .
graham , watford , uk yet another sickening example of the bbc pandering to the government 's agenda .
where 's the journalism ?
trevor cerbera , ashford , uk i accept road pricing as a good strategy , but i still signed the petition .
why ?
i do n't believe our london-centric government will make proper allowances for rural users , where there is no adequate alternative .
i do n't believe our civil-service will be able to accurately administrate the system -lrb- it will be more complicated than anything the child support agency had to cope with -rrb- , and i do n't believe the infrastructure will be put in place at a predictable and acceptable price -lrb- witness any large construction or it programme in this country in recent years -rrb- .
if the olympics and crossrail come in on-time and within budget , a working child support system is put in place , and the home office becomes a model of efficiency , i 'll rethink my position .
neil , worthing the main problem with the government 's road pricing initiative is that it will be in addition to all the other costs associated with running a car .
if it goes ahead , there will likely be a sharp increase in untaxed / uninsured vehicles .
if road pricing was in place of road fund licence and fuel duty then it could be workable and reasonable .
if not , then it is just another tax onthose whose needs are not served by public transport .
rob sandy , wellingborough , uk so cars are used too often for short and uneccessary trips .
how is road pricing going to stop this ?
road pricing places an incentived on short trips and discourages longer journeys .
the very things we 're trying to avoid !
cars are very efficient over long journeys ie going from a to b not going from near a via c to near b as for public transport .
road pricing will make long efficient car journeys expensive and will promote short inefficient car journeys pete , oxford why not get rid of the fossil fuels and make all transport green .
then make more improvements to buses , increase bus lanes and improve the rail system ; then people can have a choice to either travel on environmentally friendly public transport or get stuck in an environmentally friendy traffic jam .
the answer to the problem is green issue , not a tax and big brother surveillance issue .
ian , halifax to reduce travelling means a huge change in the way we live .
make business local , reduce house prices , make large cars a premium price to buy , i.e. anything over 1.6 add 35 % vat , stagger office working times , earlier the better , get large lorries off the road by forcing the use of rail -lsb- at reasonable prices -rsb- and introduce distribution centres then local small vans are to be used for delivery .
forget public transport it just costs far too much , its always late , its always dirty and its always cold waiting for it .
make park and ride compulsory for very large city centres , but make sure you have plenty of capacity. cpj chris parker-jones , pontypool i am disabled so have no choice but to drive everywhere , if i have to pay to drive i will be housebound. jill stone , salcombe , devon we pay tax at the petrol pump .
this takes more money from those with bigger cars and more from those that travel far .
therefore , road pricing is simply another tax .
mind you why should the labour chancellor worry .
people have been sleep walking through all the other tax rises these last few years with barely a bleat .
so , road pricing will not be stopped .
bob gardiner , kirkbymoorside firstly you should see congestion on other european countries before criticising britain !
i believe this country has an excellent road system and congestion is way better than countries like italy -lrb- where i am from -rrb- in italy there is an expensive road pricing scheme and congestion is appalling .
france is not much better and roads are even more expensive that italy .
as the vast majority of congestion is caused by people going to work , i believe we should look at a new , and more advanced working practice such as flexible working hours and working from home. andy , london to the untrained eye the goverment appear to simply desire clear roads by taxing off the lower classes , i.e. those who just can not afford it .
mobility will become an issue of privelage .
there are no credible alternatives at present nor could there be in any short term plan .
bus and rail are woefully under-invested in .
the japanese have been running bullet trains since before i was born , there 's even a decommissioned one in york nrm .
yet more lack lustre posturing to generate revenue for something else .
simon brookes , leicester everyone complains about congestion , but everyone complains about the proposals , like road pricing , to address congestion ; even when you go down the route of building enough road space to meet demand , everyone complains that we are " concreting over britain " and " raping the countryside " .
the simple answer is for everyone to stop complaining and stop using their cars as much .

road pricing proposals have provoked a storm of protest but what is the alternative in easing congestion ?
downing street 's website may have melted under the 1.8 million petitioners opposed to the government 's national road pricing scheme for dealing with congestion .
traffic in central london has fallen but how would the petitioners stop the uk from being the most extensively traffic congested country in europe ?
many argue for the traditional " predict and provide " approach to traffic growth : more road building , more parking and removing bus lanes .
but are these credible alternatives to dealing with our insatiable desire to drive more vehicles more frequently to more places ?
indeed , there is credible evidence that such measures only exacerbate congestion by inducing extra traffic .
certainly the decline of public transport - especially the bus in rural areas - has made people much more car dependent , a trend exacerbated by planning support for some out-of-town developments and the government 's " big is beautiful " approach to the closure of thousands of post offices , scores of hospitals and hundreds of police stations , not to mention the scarcity of school buses .
pricing pluses but people have also become hooked on unnecessary car use .
the department for transport says a quarter of journeys under two miles are by car which may explain why in the last decade , the number of walking trips per person fell from 292 to 245 and why there are now more households with at least two cars than with no car .
we 're going to have a transport system to rival the best in europe john prescott , 1997 the anti-road pricers make no mention of the pluses of road pricing claimed in the recent treasury commissioned study by former ba chief sir rod eddington : congestion cut by half , £ 28bn a year benefits to bus and rail users .
unless demand is controlled , by 2025 the dft forecasts that car use will grow by 40 % .
computer modelling suggests that will double the time we spend in congested traffic .
all this is a very far cry from john prescott 's vision in 1997 in which he said he would regard himself as having failed had he not reduced car use within five years .
the clear message was : our rapid growth in hyper mobility was unsustainable and major road projects were put on hold .
in december 1999 mr prescott promised : " we 're going to have a transport system to rival the best in europe " -lrb- only to telephone a senior official the next day for the facts and figures about how far behind europe our transport system was -rrb- .
but the following year his 10-year plan for transport restored the emphasis on mobility and revived road building .
motorists were promised traffic could grow whilst congestion would be reduced by up to 6 % by 2010 .
" the arithmetic did n't add up " said professor phil goodwin , a key prescott adviser .
" the more traffic there is , the slower it goes .
it 's a fundamental law of traffic but it looked for a while as if the government had found a way to abolish it . "
square one mr prescott did get powers for local authorities to introduce congestion charging at their discretion - provided they got approval from ministers .
but a later transport minister john spellar tried to sabotage london mayor ken livingstone 's plans to introduce the congestion charge .
the 10-year plan was effectively laid to rest within two years by the then transport secretary alastair darling announcing a 20 % rise in congestion by 2010 rather than the 6 % reduction that had been promised .
he also announced a new £ 3bn roads scheme : " the government is listening to motorists and is committed to getting our roads moving again . "
now the government has returned to where they started when they took office : that it 's never going to be possible for road building to keep pace with traffic growth and that the only way to control that is through pricing .
reductions in traffic will hit public transport disproportionately road pricing trials will take place in several urban areas in about five years , although the dft appears to have excluded the most congested sections of the strategic road network from these trials .
meanwhile , their target for reducing congestion - a 3.6 % increase in journey time in the 10 largest urban areas by 2010-11 - is a " weak ambition " says the transport committee .
road pricing , anyway , will not be " the silver bullet " which eliminates congestion .
the public transport system will need to be hugely expanded .
a 5 % reduction in road traffic may equate to a 50 % increase in demand for bus and rail services .
to absorb this extra demand - and ahead of the road pricing - public transport will need to be much more attractive .
but by 2005 in real terms bus and coach fares were 42 % and rail fares 39 % higher than in 1980 whereas the overall cost of motoring is 9 % below 1980 levels .
as it is the dft is well adrift from its 2010 target to increase public transport by 12 % compared with 2000 levels in every region of england , a target which itself displays a " lack of ambition " says the transport committee .
" are we there yet ? " on the roads ?
answer : " not yet " and at this rate " perhaps never " .
are we there yet ? was on bbc two on tuesday , 6 march , 2007 at 1930 gmt .
add your comments on this story , using the form below .
i support it .
i rarely drive but i punished with high road tax .
public transport needs to improve though in terms of network and price .
where i grew up in oxfordshire the last bus was at 7pm .
i saved all my money for a car from when i was 16 so i could be able to see my friends .
where my parent live now it cost £ 2.80 for a single bus journy of 6 miles .
people that live outside of big towns do have an option with poor and expensive servies .
the road prices need to target the right areas .
tom , london why do we all think we have an automatic right to a driving licence ?
rather than let the government sell off the right to use the roads to their rich croneys -lrb- tax and tax again until only the super rich can afford it -rrb- why not tackle the problem at source .
there are too many vehicles and too many people wanting to drive them .
if we had a cap on the number of driving licences issued we could increase standards .
lose your licence through bad driving and you 'll have to go to the back of the queue .
a driving licence should become a treasured qualification rather than an automatic right .
steve brindle , wimbledon , london , uk i work 35 miles from where i live , travelling round the m25 every day , i want to move closer but it would cost about 10k to move into a house of similar price to the one i am in -lrb- but difference in prices would mean that it would be smaller -rrb- .
a serious alternative would be to help people move to reduce congestion - the money charged should be made available to people who would want move to cover fees and stamp duty .
graham , watford , uk yet another sickening example of the bbc pandering to the government 's agenda .
where 's the journalism ?
trevor cerbera , ashford , uk i accept road pricing as a good strategy , but i still signed the petition .
why ?
i do n't believe our london-centric government will make proper allowances for rural users , where there is no adequate alternative .
i do n't believe our civil-service will be able to accurately administrate the system -lrb- it will be more complicated than anything the child support agency had to cope with -rrb- , and i do n't believe the infrastructure will be put in place at a predictable and acceptable price -lrb- witness any large construction or it programme in this country in recent years -rrb- .
if the olympics and crossrail come in on-time and within budget , a working child support system is put in place , and the home office becomes a model of efficiency , i 'll rethink my position .
neil , worthing the main problem with the government 's road pricing initiative is that it will be in addition to all the other costs associated with running a car .
if it goes ahead , there will likely be a sharp increase in untaxed / uninsured vehicles .
if road pricing was in place of road fund licence and fuel duty then it could be workable and reasonable .
if not , then it is just another tax onthose whose needs are not served by public transport .
rob sandy , wellingborough , uk so cars are used too often for short and uneccessary trips .
how is road pricing going to stop this ?
road pricing places an incentived on short trips and discourages longer journeys .
the very things we 're trying to avoid !
cars are very efficient over long journeys ie going from a to b not going from near a via c to near b as for public transport .
road pricing will make long efficient car journeys expensive and will promote short inefficient car journeys pete , oxford why not get rid of the fossil fuels and make all transport green .
then make more improvements to buses , increase bus lanes and improve the rail system ; then people can have a choice to either travel on environmentally friendly public transport or get stuck in an environmentally friendy traffic jam .
the answer to the problem is green issue , not a tax and big brother surveillance issue .
ian , halifax to reduce travelling means a huge change in the way we live .
make business local , reduce house prices , make large cars a premium price to buy , i.e. anything over 1.6 add 35 % vat , stagger office working times , earlier the better , get large lorries off the road by forcing the use of rail -lsb- at reasonable prices -rsb- and introduce distribution centres then local small vans are to be used for delivery .
forget public transport it just costs far too much , its always late , its always dirty and its always cold waiting for it .
make park and ride compulsory for very large city centres , but make sure you have plenty of capacity. cpj chris parker-jones , pontypool i am disabled so have no choice but to drive everywhere , if i have to pay to drive i will be housebound. jill stone , salcombe , devon we pay tax at the petrol pump .
this takes more money from those with bigger cars and more from those that travel far .
therefore , road pricing is simply another tax .
mind you why should the labour chancellor worry .
people have been sleep walking through all the other tax rises these last few years with barely a bleat .
so , road pricing will not be stopped .
bob gardiner , kirkbymoorside firstly you should see congestion on other european countries before criticising britain !
i believe this country has an excellent road system and congestion is way better than countries like italy -lrb- where i am from -rrb- in italy there is an expensive road pricing scheme and congestion is appalling .
france is not much better and roads are even more expensive that italy .
as the vast majority of congestion is caused by people going to work , i believe we should look at a new , and more advanced working practice such as flexible working hours and working from home. andy , london to the untrained eye the goverment appear to simply desire clear roads by taxing off the lower classes , i.e. those who just can not afford it .
mobility will become an issue of privelage .
there are no credible alternatives at present nor could there be in any short term plan .
bus and rail are woefully under-invested in .
the japanese have been running bullet trains since before i was born , there 's even a decommissioned one in york nrm .
yet more lack lustre posturing to generate revenue for something else .
simon brookes , leicester everyone complains about congestion , but everyone complains about the proposals , like road pricing , to address congestion ; even when you go down the route of building enough road space to meet demand , everyone complains that we are " concreting over britain " and " raping the countryside " .
the simple answer is for everyone to stop complaining and stop using their cars as much .

but a later transport minister john spellar tried to sabotage london mayor ken livingstone 's plans to introduce the congestion charge .
the 10-year plan was effectively laid to rest within two years by the then transport secretary alastair darling announcing a 20 % rise in congestion by 2010 rather than the 6 % reduction that had been promised .
he also announced a new £ 3bn roads scheme : " the government is listening to motorists and is committed to getting our roads moving again . "
now the government has returned to where they started when they took office : that it 's never going to be possible for road building to keep pace with traffic growth and that the only way to control that is through pricing .
reductions in traffic will hit public transport disproportionately road pricing trials will take place in several urban areas in about five years , although the dft appears to have excluded the most congested sections of the strategic road network from these trials .
meanwhile , their target for reducing congestion - a 3.6 % increase in journey time in the 10 largest urban areas by 2010-11 - is a " weak ambition " says the transport committee .
road pricing , anyway , will not be " the silver bullet " which eliminates congestion .
the public transport system will need to be hugely expanded .
a 5 % reduction in road traffic may equate to a 50 % increase in demand for bus and rail services .
to absorb this extra demand - and ahead of the road pricing - public transport will need to be much more attractive .
but by 2005 in real terms bus and coach fares were 42 % and rail fares 39 % higher than in 1980 whereas the overall cost of motoring is 9 % below 1980 levels .
as it is the dft is well adrift from its 2010 target to increase public transport by 12 % compared with 2000 levels in every region of england , a target which itself displays a " lack of ambition " says the transport committee .
" are we there yet ? " on the roads ?
answer : " not yet " and at this rate " perhaps never " .

i support it .
i rarely drive but i punished with high road tax .
public transport needs to improve though in terms of network and price .
where i grew up in oxfordshire the last bus was at 7pm .
i saved all my money for a car from when i was 16 so i could be able to see my friends .
where my parent live now it cost £ 2.80 for a single bus journy of 6 miles .
people that live outside of big towns do have an option with poor and expensive servies .
the road prices need to target the right areas .
tom , london why do we all think we have an automatic right to a driving licence ?
rather than let the government sell off the right to use the roads to their rich croneys -lrb- tax and tax again until only the super rich can afford it -rrb- why not tackle the problem at source .
there are too many vehicles and too many people wanting to drive them .
if we had a cap on the number of driving licences issued we could increase standards .
lose your licence through bad driving and you 'll have to go to the back of the queue .
a driving licence should become a treasured qualification rather than an automatic right .
steve brindle , wimbledon , london , uk i work 35 miles from where i live , travelling round the m25 every day , i want to move closer but it would cost about 10k to move into a house of similar price to the one i am in -lrb- but difference in prices would mean that it would be smaller -rrb- .
a serious alternative would be to help people move to reduce congestion - the money charged should be made available to people who would want move to cover fees and stamp duty .
graham , watford , uk yet another sickening example of the bbc pandering to the government 's agenda .
where 's the journalism ?
trevor cerbera , ashford , uk i accept road pricing as a good strategy , but i still signed the petition .
why ?
i do n't believe our london-centric government will make proper allowances for rural users , where there is no adequate alternative .
i do n't believe our civil-service will be able to accurately administrate the system -lrb- it will be more complicated than anything the child support agency had to cope with -rrb- , and i do n't believe the infrastructure will be put in place at a predictable and acceptable price -lrb- witness any large construction or it programme in this country in recent years -rrb- .
if the olympics and crossrail come in on-time and within budget , a working child support system is put in place , and the home office becomes a model of efficiency , i 'll rethink my position .
neil , worthing the main problem with the government 's road pricing initiative is that it will be in addition to all the other costs associated with running a car .
if it goes ahead , there will likely be a sharp increase in untaxed / uninsured vehicles .
if road pricing was in place of road fund licence and fuel duty then it could be workable and reasonable .
if not , then it is just another tax onthose whose needs are not served by public transport .
rob sandy , wellingborough , uk so cars are used too often for short and uneccessary trips .
how is road pricing going to stop this ?
road pricing places an incentived on short trips and discourages longer journeys .
the very things we 're trying to avoid !
cars are very efficient over long journeys ie going from a to b not going from near a via c to near b as for public transport .
road pricing will make long efficient car journeys expensive and will promote short inefficient car journeys pete , oxford why not get rid of the fossil fuels and make all transport green .
then make more improvements to buses , increase bus lanes and improve the rail system ; then people can have a choice to either travel on environmentally friendly public transport or get stuck in an environmentally friendy traffic jam .
the answer to the problem is green issue , not a tax and big brother surveillance issue .
ian , halifax to reduce travelling means a huge change in the way we live .
make business local , reduce house prices , make large cars a premium price to buy , i.e. anything over 1.6 add 35 % vat , stagger office working times , earlier the better , get large lorries off the road by forcing the use of rail -lsb- at reasonable prices -rsb- and introduce distribution centres then local small vans are to be used for delivery .
forget public transport it just costs far too much , its always late , its always dirty and its always cold waiting for it .
make park and ride compulsory for very large city centres , but make sure you have plenty of capacity. cpj chris parker-jones , pontypool i am disabled so have no choice but to drive everywhere , if i have to pay to drive i will be housebound. jill stone , salcombe , devon we pay tax at the petrol pump .
this takes more money from those with bigger cars and more from those that travel far .
therefore , road pricing is simply another tax .
mind you why should the labour chancellor worry .
people have been sleep walking through all the other tax rises these last few years with barely a bleat .
so , road pricing will not be stopped .
bob gardiner , kirkbymoorside firstly you should see congestion on other european countries before criticising britain !
i believe this country has an excellent road system and congestion is way better than countries like italy -lrb- where i am from -rrb- in italy there is an expensive road pricing scheme and congestion is appalling .
france is not much better and roads are even more expensive that italy .
as the vast majority of congestion is caused by people going to work , i believe we should look at a new , and more advanced working practice such as flexible working hours and working from home. andy , london to the untrained eye the goverment appear to simply desire clear roads by taxing off the lower classes , i.e. those who just can not afford it .
mobility will become an issue of privelage .
there are no credible alternatives at present nor could there be in any short term plan .
bus and rail are woefully under-invested in .
the japanese have been running bullet trains since before i was born , there 's even a decommissioned one in york nrm .
yet more lack lustre posturing to generate revenue for something else .
simon brookes , leicester everyone complains about congestion , but everyone complains about the proposals , like road pricing , to address congestion ; even when you go down the route of building enough road space to meet demand , everyone complains that we are " concreting over britain " and " raping the countryside " .
the simple answer is for everyone to stop complaining and stop using their cars as much .

road pricing proposals have provoked a storm of protest but what is the alternative in easing congestion ?
downing street 's website may have melted under the 1.8 million petitioners opposed to the government 's national road pricing scheme for dealing with congestion .
traffic in central london has fallen but how would the petitioners stop the uk from being the most extensively traffic congested country in europe ?
many argue for the traditional " predict and provide " approach to traffic growth : more road building , more parking and removing bus lanes .
but are these credible alternatives to dealing with our insatiable desire to drive more vehicles more frequently to more places ?
indeed , there is credible evidence that such measures only exacerbate congestion by inducing extra traffic .
certainly the decline of public transport - especially the bus in rural areas - has made people much more car dependent , a trend exacerbated by planning support for some out-of-town developments and the government 's " big is beautiful " approach to the closure of thousands of post offices , scores of hospitals and hundreds of police stations , not to mention the scarcity of school buses .
pricing pluses but people have also become hooked on unnecessary car use .
the department for transport says a quarter of journeys under two miles are by car which may explain why in the last decade , the number of walking trips per person fell from 292 to 245 and why there are now more households with at least two cars than with no car .
we 're going to have a transport system to rival the best in europe john prescott , 1997 the anti-road pricers make no mention of the pluses of road pricing claimed in the recent treasury commissioned study by former ba chief sir rod eddington : congestion cut by half , £ 28bn a year benefits to bus and rail users .
unless demand is controlled , by 2025 the dft forecasts that car use will grow by 40 % .
computer modelling suggests that will double the time we spend in congested traffic .
all this is a very far cry from john prescott 's vision in 1997 in which he said he would regard himself as having failed had he not reduced car use within five years .
the clear message was : our rapid growth in hyper mobility was unsustainable and major road projects were put on hold .
in december 1999 mr prescott promised : " we 're going to have a transport system to rival the best in europe " -lrb- only to telephone a senior official the next day for the facts and figures about how far behind europe our transport system was -rrb- .
but the following year his 10-year plan for transport restored the emphasis on mobility and revived road building .
motorists were promised traffic could grow whilst congestion would be reduced by up to 6 % by 2010 .
" the arithmetic did n't add up " said professor phil goodwin , a key prescott adviser .
" the more traffic there is , the slower it goes .
it 's a fundamental law of traffic but it looked for a while as if the government had found a way to abolish it . "
square one mr prescott did get powers for local authorities to introduce congestion charging at their discretion - provided they got approval from ministers .
but a later transport minister john spellar tried to sabotage london mayor ken livingstone 's plans to introduce the congestion charge .

rob sandy , wellingborough , uk so cars are used too often for short and uneccessary trips .
how is road pricing going to stop this ?
road pricing places an incentived on short trips and discourages longer journeys .
the very things we 're trying to avoid !
cars are very efficient over long journeys ie going from a to b not going from near a via c to near b as for public transport .
road pricing will make long efficient car journeys expensive and will promote short inefficient car journeys pete , oxford why not get rid of the fossil fuels and make all transport green .
then make more improvements to buses , increase bus lanes and improve the rail system ; then people can have a choice to either travel on environmentally friendly public transport or get stuck in an environmentally friendy traffic jam .
the answer to the problem is green issue , not a tax and big brother surveillance issue .
ian , halifax to reduce travelling means a huge change in the way we live .
make business local , reduce house prices , make large cars a premium price to buy , i.e. anything over 1.6 add 35 % vat , stagger office working times , earlier the better , get large lorries off the road by forcing the use of rail -lsb- at reasonable prices -rsb- and introduce distribution centres then local small vans are to be used for delivery .
forget public transport it just costs far too much , its always late , its always dirty and its always cold waiting for it .
make park and ride compulsory for very large city centres , but make sure you have plenty of capacity. cpj chris parker-jones , pontypool i am disabled so have no choice but to drive everywhere , if i have to pay to drive i will be housebound. jill stone , salcombe , devon we pay tax at the petrol pump .
this takes more money from those with bigger cars and more from those that travel far .
therefore , road pricing is simply another tax .
mind you why should the labour chancellor worry .
people have been sleep walking through all the other tax rises these last few years with barely a bleat .
so , road pricing will not be stopped .
bob gardiner , kirkbymoorside firstly you should see congestion on other european countries before criticising britain !
i believe this country has an excellent road system and congestion is way better than countries like italy -lrb- where i am from -rrb- in italy there is an expensive road pricing scheme and congestion is appalling .
france is not much better and roads are even more expensive that italy .
as the vast majority of congestion is caused by people going to work , i believe we should look at a new , and more advanced working practice such as flexible working hours and working from home. andy , london to the untrained eye the goverment appear to simply desire clear roads by taxing off the lower classes , i.e. those who just can not afford it .
mobility will become an issue of privelage .
there are no credible alternatives at present nor could there be in any short term plan .
bus and rail are woefully under-invested in .
the japanese have been running bullet trains since before i was born , there 's even a decommissioned one in york nrm .
yet more lack lustre posturing to generate revenue for something else .
simon brookes , leicester everyone complains about congestion , but everyone complains about the proposals , like road pricing , to address congestion ; even when you go down the route of building enough road space to meet demand , everyone complains that we are " concreting over britain " and " raping the countryside " .
the simple answer is for everyone to stop complaining and stop using their cars as much .

road pricing proposals have provoked a storm of protest but what is the alternative in easing congestion ?
downing street 's website may have melted under the 1.8 million petitioners opposed to the government 's national road pricing scheme for dealing with congestion .
but how would the petitioners stop the uk from being the most extensively traffic congested country in europe ?
many argue for the traditional " predict and provide " approach to traffic growth : more road building , more parking and removing bus lanes .
but are these credible alternatives to dealing with our insatiable desire to drive more vehicles more frequently to more places ?
indeed , there is credible evidence that such measures only exacerbate congestion by inducing extra traffic .
certainly the decline of public transport - especially the bus in rural areas - has made people much more car dependent , a trend exacerbated by planning support for some out-of-town developments and the government 's " big is beautiful " approach to the closure of thousands of post offices , scores of hospitals and hundreds of police stations , not to mention the scarcity of school buses .
pricing pluses but people have also become hooked on unnecessary car use .
the department for transport says a quarter of journeys under two miles are by car which may explain why in the last decade , the number of walking trips per person fell from 292 to 245 and why there are now more households with at least two cars than with no car . "
we 're going to have a transport system to rival the best in europe " john prescott , 1997 the anti-road pricers make no mention of the pluses of road pricing claimed in the recent treasury commissioned study by former ba chief sir rod eddington : congestion cut by half , £ 28bn a year benefits to bus and rail users .
unless demand is controlled , by 2025 the dft forecasts that car use will grow by 40 % .
computer modelling suggests that will double the time we spend in congested traffic .
all this is a very far cry from john prescott 's vision in 1997 in which he said he would regard himself as having failed had he not reduced car use within five years .
the clear message was : our rapid growth in hyper mobility was unsustainable and major road projects were put on hold .
in december 1999 mr prescott promised : " we 're going to have a transport system to rival the best in europe " -lrb- only to telephone a senior official the next day for the facts and figures about how far behind europe our transport system was -rrb- .
but the following year his 10-year plan for transport restored the emphasis on mobility and revived road building .
motorists were promised traffic could grow whilst congestion would be reduced by up to 6 % by 2010 .
" the arithmetic did n't add up " said professor phil goodwin , a key prescott adviser .
" the more traffic there is , the slower it goes .
it 's a fundamental law of traffic but it looked for a while as if the government had found a way to abolish it . "
square one mr prescott did get powers for local authorities to introduce congestion charging at their discretion - provided they got approval from ministers .
but a later transport minister john spellar tried to sabotage london mayor ken livingstone 's plans to introduce the congestion charge .
the 10-year plan was effectively laid to rest within two years by the then transport secretary alastair darling announcing a 20 % rise in congestion by 2010 rather than the 6 % reduction that had been promised .
he also announced a new £ 3bn roads scheme : " the government is listening to motorists and is committed to getting our roads moving again . "
now the government has returned to where they started when they took office : that it 's never going to be possible for road building to keep pace with traffic growth and that the only way to control that is through pricing .
road pricing trials will take place in several urban areas in about five years , although the dft appears to have excluded the most congested sections of the strategic road network from these trials .
meanwhile , their target for reducing congestion - a 3.6 % increase in journey time in the 10 largest urban areas by 2010-11 - is a " weak ambition " says the transport committee .
road pricing , anyway , will not be " the silver bullet " which eliminates congestion .
the public transport system will need to be hugely expanded .
a 5 % reduction in road traffic may equate to a 50 % increase in demand for bus and rail services .
to absorb this extra demand - and ahead of the road pricing - public transport will need to be much more attractive .
but by 2005 in real terms bus and coach fares were 42 % and rail fares 39 % higher than in 1980 whereas the overall cost of motoring is 9 % below 1980 levels .
as it is the dft is well adrift from its 2010 target to increase public transport by 12 % compared with 2000 levels in every region of england , a target which itself displays a " lack of ambition " says the transport committee .
" are we there yet ? " on the roads ?
answer : " not yet " and at this rate " perhaps never " .
are we there yet ? was on bbc two on tuesday , 6 march , 2007 at 1930 gmt .
add your comments on this story , using the form below .
i support it .
i rarely drive but i punished with high road tax .
public transport needs to improve though in terms of network and price .
where i grew up in oxfordshire the last bus was at 7pm .
i saved all my money for a car from when i was 16 so i could be able to see my friends .
where my parent live now it cost £ 2.80 for a single bus journy of 6 miles .
people that live outside of big towns do have an option with poor and expensive servies .
the road prices need to target the right areas .
tom , london why do we all think we have an automatic right to a driving licence ?
rather than let the government sell off the right to use the roads to their rich croneys -lrb- tax and tax again until only the super rich can afford it -rrb- why not tackle the problem at source .
there are too many vehicles and too many people wanting to drive them .
if we had a cap on the number of driving licences issued we could increase standards .
lose your licence through bad driving and you 'll have to go to the back of the queue .
a driving licence should become a treasured qualification rather than an automatic right .
steve brindle , wimbledon , london , uk i work 35 miles from where i live , travelling round the m25 every day , i want to move closer but it would cost about 10k to move into a house of similar price to the one i am in -lrb- but difference in prices would mean that it would be smaller -rrb- .
a serious alternative would be to help people move to reduce congestion - the money charged should be made available to people who would want move to cover fees and stamp duty .
graham , watford , uk yet another sickening example of the bbc pandering to the government 's agenda .
where 's the journalism ?
trevor cerbera , ashford , uk i accept road pricing as a good strategy , but i still signed the petition .
why ?
i do n't believe our london-centric government will make proper allowances for rural users , where there is no adequate alternative .
i do n't believe our civil-service will be able to accurately administrate the system -lrb- it will be more complicated than anything the child support agency had to cope with -rrb- , and i do n't believe the infrastructure will be put in place at a predictable and acceptable price -lrb- witness any large construction or it programme in this country in recent years -rrb- .
if the olympics and crossrail come in on-time and within budget , a working child support system is put in place , and the home office becomes a model of efficiency , i 'll rethink my position .
neil , worthing the main problem with the government 's road pricing initiative is that it will be in addition to all the other costs associated with running a car .
if it goes ahead , there will likely be a sharp increase in untaxed / uninsured vehicles .
if road pricing was in place of road fund licence and fuel duty then it could be workable and reasonable .
if not , then it is just another tax onthose whose needs are not served by public transport .
rob sandy , wellingborough , uk so cars are used too often for short and uneccessary trips .

humberto recalde was removed after it emerged his department had used expired chemicals in its fumigation campaigns .
so far this year 16,297 dengue cases have been officially reported - eight times the total for the whole of 2006 .
a state of emergency is in place .
doctors ' groups in paraguay say the true figure could be closer to 150,000 .
a severe outbreak has also been reported in the neighbouring south-western brazilian state of mato grosso do sul , where the number of cases is estimated over 45,000 .
argentina and bolivia have also reported a rise in cases of dengue , which is endemic in much of the americas .
the rise in cases has been blamed by experts on a higher rainfall and uncommonly warm weather , which have boosted the population of the aedes aegypti mosquito .
dengue fever causes severe headaches , as well as muscle and joint pain .

argentina and bolivia have also reported a rise in cases of dengue , which is endemic in much of the americas .

the controversy is not over public spending on culture - french taxpayers think nothing of subsidising films to the tune of 500m euros a year -lrb- $ 700m ; £ 350m -rrb- .
the row centres on the fact that france stands to make money from the deal , which was signed in abu dhabi on tuesday .
a good deal of money , in fact .
abu dhabi - the capital of the united arab emirates - will pay hundreds of millions of euros over 30 years for the privilege of displaying works from french museums .
the oil-rich emirate will pay 400 million euros -lrb- $ 524m ; £ 272m -rrb- just for the louvre name .
the first payment , 150m euros , will be made within a month , according to the french news agency afp .
this , according to critics , amounts to using france 's artistic heritage for basely commercial ends .
" our museums are not for sale " , proclaims an online petition signed by 4,700 people - including many curators , art historians , and archaeologists .

the architect will be french .
construction costs will be borne by the emirate .
most controversially , the agreement will allow abu dhabi to lease works from the louvre and other french museums for durations of up to two years .
this is what many in the french art world find offensive .
" the purpose of a gallery should not be to make money , " arts writer didier rykner told the bbc news website .
" people talk about a cultural exception for cinema .

no comment mr rykner , who drew up the petition and posted it on his website , la tribune de l 'art , says the project was not designed with the best interest of art in mind .
abu dhabi is keen to expand its cultural offerings french museums will be deprived of major works , which will be displayed in a " random , unscientific " way in abu dhabi , mr rykner contends .
he also points out that transporting hundreds of fragile works is fraught with risk .
" the logic of this project is purely political and diplomatic , " says mr rykner , who points out that the uae is a major ally and customer of france .
he says most french art historians and curators agree with him - although many , who are state employees , have not signed his petition for fear of damaging their careers .
the government , meanwhile , has remained tight-lipped about the deal .
when contacted by the bbc , the culture ministry declined to comment ahead of the signing .

thousands of people have signed up to help develop a community-built massively multiplayer online role playing game -lrb- mmo -rrb- .
developer dave perry and publisher acclaim are building a professional mmo with the help of ordinary people .
one of the users will be chosen to " direct " a future game and will receive any royalties earned .
" i want it to be a title they own and feel excited about , " said mr perry , a 24-year veteran of the games industry .
overwhelming response the original goal was to try to develop a title faster than if it was done by professional developers alone , he said .
the project , known as top secret , is looking for artists , writers , designers and audio technicians from the ranks of ordinary gamers .
" with 20,000 people signed up we are already the biggest development team in history .
" we will end up with 100,000 people on this team. if 1 % is any good , we are good to go . "
gamers have been able to sign up since last week and mr perry said he had been overwhelmed by the response .
" there is a real pent-up level of interest we did n't expect .
we have touched a nerve . "
there is a tradition of non-professionals creating content for the games industry .
the 1998 pc game half life spawned an entire industry when fans created a modified -lrb- mod -rrb- version of the title , called counter strike .
crowd sourcing " ultimately we are going to see that the games development industry is much bigger than we thought , " dave perry many firms offer tools to users to help them build content and mods but this is believed to be the most ambitious commercial project to date .
mr perry has worked in the games industry since he was 15 years old .
in recent years he has made the transition from lead programmer to studio head and is currently working on four other mmos , as well as creating a games finance business and driving the creation of an open source , global map of gaming .
a professional team of artists , programmers , designers , and audio staff will build the mmo but the creative impetus will come from the users .
" we are not doing this for fun ; this is a professional game we are trying to make .
it 's a business .
" i hope it will prove to us that consumers are useful . "
mr perry is hoping to take advantage of so-called crowd sourcing or " accepting that the combined intelligence of all these people is far beyond your own . "
" while we want to think we 've got all the best ideas it 's just not true , " added the northern ireland-born , now la-based , developer .
back-up plan mmos have become one of the most popular gaming genres , with titles like world of warcraft attracting millions of monthly subscribers around the world .
mr perry said successful mmos kept gamers on a continuing path of new experiences .
he said he expected the volunteers to come and go over time , with some recruited by the games industry to work on other projects .
" i am expecting a lot of head-hunters , developers and publishers to be looking around and trolling through the responses and hiring anyone that is good .
" i also expect to see splinter groups ; teams of three or four working together on other projects . "
he said that the whole industry would have something to gain from the experience .
but he also said there was a back-up plan in place , if the contributions from gamers prove disappointing .
" if they deliver zero , we can still ship a title , " he said .
mr perry is also helping the development of an interactive map which will reveal the global reach of the games industry .
he has funded a programmer to help start the map and is now turning over its development to users .
" it has to be created by the people for the people - they have to have complete control . "
the map will encompass games developers , publishers and colleges offering gaming courses around the globe .
" ultimately we are going to see that the games development industry is much bigger than we thought , " he said .

thousands of people have signed up to help develop a community-built massively multiplayer online role playing game -lrb- mmo -rrb- .
developer dave perry and publisher acclaim are building a professional mmo with the help of ordinary people .
one of the users will be chosen to " direct " a future game and will receive any royalties earned .
" i want it to be a title they own and feel excited about , " said mr perry , a 24-year veteran of the games industry .
overwhelming response the original goal was to try to develop a title faster than if it was done by professional developers alone , he said .
the project , known as top secret , is looking for artists , writers , designers and audio technicians from the ranks of ordinary gamers .
" with 20,000 people signed up we are already the biggest development team in history .
" we will end up with 100,000 people on this team. if 1 % is any good , we are good to go . "
gamers have been able to sign up since last week and mr perry said he had been overwhelmed by the response .
" there is a real pent-up level of interest we did n't expect .
we have touched a nerve . "
there is a tradition of non-professionals creating content for the games industry .
the 1998 pc game half life spawned an entire industry when fans created a modified -lrb- mod -rrb- version of the title , called counter strike .
crowd sourcing ultimately we are going to see that the games development industry is much bigger than we thought , dave perry many firms offer tools to users to help them build content and mods but this is believed to be the most ambitious commercial project to date .
mr perry has worked in the games industry since he was 15 years old .
in recent years he has made the transition from lead programmer to studio head and is currently working on four other mmos , as well as creating a games finance business and driving the creation of an open source , global map of gaming .
a professional team of artists , programmers , designers , and audio staff will build the mmo but the creative impetus will come from the users .
" we are not doing this for fun ; this is a professional game we are trying to make .
it 's a business .
" i hope it will prove to us that consumers are useful . "
mr perry is hoping to take advantage of so-called crowd sourcing or " accepting that the combined intelligence of all these people is far beyond your own . "
" while we want to think we 've got all the best ideas it 's just not true , " added the northern ireland-born , now la-based , developer .
back-up plan mmos have become one of the most popular gaming genres , with titles like world of warcraft attracting millions of monthly subscribers around the world .
mr perry said successful mmos kept gamers on a continuing path of new experiences .
he said he expected the volunteers to come and go over time , with some recruited by the games industry to work on other projects .
" i am expecting a lot of head-hunters , developers and publishers to be looking around and trolling through the responses and hiring anyone that is good .
" i also expect to see splinter groups ; teams of three or four working together on other projects . "
he said that the whole industry would have something to gain from the experience .
but he also said there was a back-up plan in place , if the contributions from gamers prove disappointing .
" if they deliver zero , we can still ship a title , " he said .
mr perry is also helping the development of an interactive map which will reveal the global reach of the games industry .
he has funded a programmer to help start the map and is now turning over its development to users .
" it has to be created by the people for the people - they have to have complete control . "
the map will encompass games developers , publishers and colleges offering gaming courses around the globe .

" i am expecting a lot of head-hunters , developers and publishers to be looking around and trolling through the responses and hiring anyone that is good .
" i also expect to see splinter groups ; teams of three or four working together on other projects . "
he said that the whole industry would have something to gain from the experience .
but he also said there was a back-up plan in place , if the contributions from gamers prove disappointing .
" if they deliver zero , we can still ship a title , " he said .
mr perry is also helping the development of an interactive map which will reveal the global reach of the games industry .
he has funded a programmer to help start the map and is now turning over its development to users .
" it has to be created by the people for the people - they have to have complete control . "
the map will encompass games developers , publishers and colleges offering gaming courses around the globe .
" ultimately we are going to see that the games development industry is much bigger than we thought , " he said .

university of bristol researchers say the caffeine eases withdrawal symptoms which build up overnight , but does not make people more alert than normal .
the work , presented to the british nutrition foundation conference , showed only people who have avoided coffee for a while will get a buzz from caffeine .
but the british coffee association said regular drinkers did feel more alert .
that alertness you feel is you getting back to normal professor peter rogers , bristol university those who swear by their morning caffeine fix say it wakes them up , and if they missed out they would feel sluggish and unable to get on with their day .
but the bristol researchers , who carried out a review of previous studies into the effects of caffeine , say all the drink does is counteract the mild caffeine withdrawal symptoms people are experiencing because they have gone without the stimulant overnight .
and those who drink a caffeinated drink first thing are no more alert than those who never consume one .
' back to normal ' professor peter rogers , a biological psychologist who led the research , told the bbc : " we do feel a boost from caffeine in the morning , but that 's probably due to a reversal of the withdrawal symptoms .
" that alertness you feel is you getting back to normal , rather than to an above normal level .
" that morning boost is what people think is useful about caffeine , but if that does n't happen , maybe it 's not that useful after all . "
professor rogers said caffeine did have some benefits , such as preventing cognitive decline in the elderly .
but he said it was usually be best to opt for decaffeinated drinks - although the odd coffee could help .
" if you 're not a regular consumer , you might get something out of one or two drinks .
but once you 're a regular consumer , you 're in a cycle of withdrawal reversal . "
zoe wheeldon , of the british coffee association , said the research was interesting .
but she added : " there are two sides to the debate and a wealth of scientific evidence suggests that moderate coffee consumption of four to five cups per day is perfectly safe for the general population and does have a beneficial effect on alertness and performance even in regular coffee drinkers .

university of bristol researchers say the caffeine eases withdrawal symptoms which build up overnight , but does not make people more alert than normal .
the work , presented to the british nutrition foundation conference , showed only people who have avoided coffee for a while will get a buzz from caffeine .
but the british coffee association said regular drinkers did feel more alert .

but the bristol researchers , who carried out a review of previous studies into the effects of caffeine , say all the drink does is counteract the mild caffeine withdrawal symptoms people are experiencing because they have gone without the stimulant overnight .
and those who drink a caffeinated drink first thing are no more alert than those who never consume one .
' back to normal ' professor peter rogers , a biological psychologist who led the research , told the bbc : " we do feel a boost from caffeine in the morning , but that 's probably due to a reversal of the withdrawal symptoms .
" that alertness you feel is you getting back to normal , rather than to an above normal level .
" that morning boost is what people think is useful about caffeine , but if that does n't happen , maybe it 's not that useful after all . "
professor rogers said caffeine did have some benefits , such as preventing cognitive decline in the elderly .
but he said it was usually be best to opt for decaffeinated drinks - although the odd coffee could help .
" if you 're not a regular consumer , you might get something out of one or two drinks .

tory conferences are still one of the few events where i feel young , amid the grey hair and the pensioners in hats , but there were more younger faces than usual at the welsh party gathering in cardiff at the weekend .
changing the way the party looks also means making it less male , something mr cameron has tried to do by ensuring more women are selected as candidates .
last year , the party announced in a statement : " welsh conservatives are determined to ensure this is reflected in wales as the party selects candidates for next year 's assembly poll . "
