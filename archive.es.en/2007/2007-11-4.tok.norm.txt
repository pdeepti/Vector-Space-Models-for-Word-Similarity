the fact that young men also find their way onto the streets is less well known . in berlin , as in most major cities , boys and young men from as young as 14-years old work the curbs , sex cinemas and gay bars of the german capital .
the fact that the rent boys of berlin barely register on most people 's radars led to the creation of an association in 1992 to help those in prostitution .

once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .

later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys .

its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .

she later died in a hospital . several hundred people attended her funeral saturday , including amato and rome 's mayor walter veltroni . expulsions a 24-year-old romanian youth was arrested tuesday and stands accused of being reggiani 's assailant , which he denies .
her assault prompted an emergency decree wednesday to facilitate expulsions of eu citizens considered a security threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funeral of giovanna reggiani in rome on saturday italians have fumed for years over petty crimes by poor immigrants from romania and elsewhere . after the attack on reggiani , prodi issued a decree opening the way for prefects to expel european union citizens who were considered dangerous .
the targets of the decree have so far been immigrants from romania , which joined the bloc this year , and have the same right as other eu citizens to travel freely across borders . " nobody imagined having to face 500,000 poor souls that in one year have left romania for italy , " interior minister giuliano amato said . a judge must sign off on an expulsion order but no criminal history is necessary and nor is a trial , according to the interior ministry . milan 's prefect gianvalerio lombardi expelled the first four romanians on friday .
four new expulsion orders were signed on saturday , according to italy 's ansa news agency .
authorities in northern turin , genoa , val d 'aosta and lecce in southern italy also followed suit saturday , the news agency reported . all the decrees must be approved by judges to take effect and they only last three years .
those expelled have a month to leave the country . last year 15.4 percent of foreigners accused of murder , sexual violence and theft in italy were romanian , police say . concern over reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian police officer destroys makeshift houses on the tiber river banks friday 's attack against the three romanians at a supermarket parking lot by 10 masked men armed with sticks , knives and iron bars has raised concern of reprisals against ordinary members of the romanian community , italy 's largest immigrant group . initial reports said four were targeted in the attack in a southern roman suburb , near shantytowns where foreigners live in squalor . the most seriously injured , emil marcu , 47 , was in stable condition following an overnight operation , according to hospital sources quoted by ansa .
witnesses told police the assailants , who fled the scene , were italian . reaction to the assaults was swift , with italian media linking the incident to reggiani 's death - although the two events occurred some 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- apart - and politicians of all stripes warning against reprisals against romanians . " we must avoid at all cost a spiral of vendettas to be established , " said fabrizio cicchitto of the conservative forza italia party of former prime minister silvio berlusconi . rome mayor veltroni , recently crowned the new leader of italy 's center-left and the heir apparent to prime minister romano prodi , also urged people to " be inspired by the values of civil society , and not by vendetta . " still , the attacks have sparked partisan sparring , with the left accusing the right of using the tragedy for their political ends and berlusconi charging the leftist government of being lax on security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 04.11.2007 helping berlin 's male prostitutes one night at a time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male sex workers are often overlooked by counseling services when one hears about prostitution , one normally thinks of women forced to sell their sexual services for money .
the fact that young men also find their way onto the streets is less well known . in berlin , as in most major cities , boys and young men from as young as 14-years old work the curbs , sex cinemas and gay bars of the german capital .
the fact that the rent boys of berlin barely register on most people 's radars led to the creation of an association in 1992 to help those in prostitution .
the employees of " sub / way " visit the districts of berlin where the boys work and supply them with condoms and advice on how to be safe on the streets .
once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .
the first stop is usually a berlin train station where rent boys , many of whom have drug problems , punt for clients .
the van is watched with interest and a little suspicion until a couple of boys come over and ask for hot chocolate .
social workers form a bond with rent boys helmut wanner is a social worker with sub / way and looks after the rent boys , knows them by name and knows many of their life stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " marikas " is bavaria 's only counseling center for male prostitutes over the course of the years , he has built up a trust with many of them and despite what many people think of their lives and their work ; he has a certain amount of respect for them .
when a tragedy strikes , he feels it more than most .
" it 's terrible when somebody dies , which unfortunately seems to happen a lot , " wanner says .
" others do n't have it as bad but there is still a lot of sadness . "
later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys . # b # " on the most part you can be sure that they have very little or no education at all , " says prinalski .
" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "
easiest way to money for some towards the end of the night , the sub / way team visit the bars where the mostly eastern european boys sell themselves .
there they sit on bar stools and wait for their customers .
their fresh , young faces make it hard to believe that these boys are on the game but for most , this is the only employment they can get .
" this is the only way they can earn something , " says prinalski .
" the reality is that for a migrant with or without papers , this is the easiest and least complicated way to get work . "
circling the boys are the potential clients for the night , mainly older men .
they eye each boy individually and touch them before making the decision .
for the sub / way team , this is one of the hardest sights they have to deal with .
but optimism and success is their reward .
" many lives have been influenced in a positive sense and these scenes have been reduced , " says wanner .
the association continues to help boys escape the scene and it is the personal contact with its workers which has been credited with persuading many of those to change their lives .
however , to run the organization needs money and sub / way has to fight for its funding as it receives only minimal subsidies from the berlin senate .
only through private donations can sub / way continue to be there once a week for the rent boys of germany 's capital . dw staff -lrb- magnus rosengarten / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" suspending the constitution in a televised address to the nation , musharraf said he had imposed an emergency because terrorism in pakistan was at its peak while the government was in " semi-paralysis " through the behavior of the supreme court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf says acts of terrorism are increasing rapidly " the situation had been changing very fast .
terrorism and extremism are at their extreme , " musharraf said , citing a number of recent blasts including one in karachi that killed 139 people . musharraf , 64 , imposed the state of emergency in his capacity as army chief , suspending the constitution for the second time since he took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 . the move was apparently aimed at preventing a defiant judiciary from ruling against his re-election in last month 's controversial presidential vote .
he won overwhelmingly , but was challenged on the grounds that the constitution prohibits serving military officers from contesting elections . europe , us reject move in britain , foreign secretary david miliband stressed the need for pakistan to harness " the power of democracy and the rule of law to achieve the goals of stability , development and countering terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf " i am gravely concerned by the measures adopted today , which will take pakistan further from these goals , " said miliband in a statement . in paris , the ministry for foreign and european affairs voiced french " concern " at musharraf 's decision , urging him to " maintain the rule of law . "
france " wants dialogue between all pakistani political forces to guarantee stability and democracy in this great country which is a partner and a friend , " the ministry said in a statement . " this action is very disappointing , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement . " president musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in january and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office , " he said . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " whatever happens , we will be urging for a quick return to a constitutional order , we will be urging that the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we would be urging calm among the parties . " but a pentagon spokesman said washington at this point had no plans to suspend military aid to pakistan . closer to home reaction was more muted in india , pakistan 's neighbour and nuclear rival , with the country 's foreign ministry merely expressing its " regrets " at musharraf 's move . " we wish them stability and we look forward to conditions which will facilitate conditions for democracy to be restored in that country , " said india 's junior foreign minister anand sharma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signs for pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto but political parties allied to indian prime minister manmohan sigh 's congress-party ruling coalition reacted sharply , and the main opposition bjp party prodded new delhi to react strongly to the developments . " musharraf has shown his true colors as a military dictator and this imposition of emergency will not only have an impact in pakistan but also in the entire south asia region , " bjp spokesman rajiv pratap rudy warned . musharraf 's political rivals were similarly unsparing in their criticism .
pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto told britain 's sky news television that the country was regressing towards greater dictatorship under musharraf . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics . " if it actually becomes accepted that there were female apostles , the catholic church ca n't remain as it is , " the protestant said . hajo goertz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 04.11.2007 helping berlin 's male prostitutes one night at a time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male sex workers are often overlooked by counseling services when one hears about prostitution , one normally thinks of women forced to sell their sexual services for money .
the fact that young men also find their way onto the streets is less well known . in berlin , as in most major cities , boys and young men from as young as 14-years old work the curbs , sex cinemas and gay bars of the german capital .
the fact that the rent boys of berlin barely register on most people 's radars led to the creation of an association in 1992 to help those in prostitution .
the employees of " sub / way " visit the districts of berlin where the boys work and supply them with condoms and advice on how to be safe on the streets .
once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .
the first stop is usually a berlin train station where rent boys , many of whom have drug problems , punt for clients .
the van is watched with interest and a little suspicion until a couple of boys come over and ask for hot chocolate .
social workers form a bond with rent boys helmut wanner is a social worker with sub / way and looks after the rent boys , knows them by name and knows many of their life stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " marikas " is bavaria 's only counseling center for male prostitutes over the course of the years , he has built up a trust with many of them and despite what many people think of their lives and their work ; he has a certain amount of respect for them .
when a tragedy strikes , he feels it more than most .
" it 's terrible when somebody dies , which unfortunately seems to happen a lot , " wanner says .
" others do n't have it as bad but there is still a lot of sadness . "
later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys . # b # " on the most part you can be sure that they have very little or no education at all , " says prinalski .
" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "
easiest way to money for some towards the end of the night , the sub / way team visit the bars where the mostly eastern european boys sell themselves .
there they sit on bar stools and wait for their customers .
their fresh , young faces make it hard to believe that these boys are on the game but for most , this is the only employment they can get .
" this is the only way they can earn something , " says prinalski .
" the reality is that for a migrant with or without papers , this is the easiest and least complicated way to get work . "
circling the boys are the potential clients for the night , mainly older men .
they eye each boy individually and touch them before making the decision .
for the sub / way team , this is one of the hardest sights they have to deal with .
but optimism and success is their reward .
" many lives have been influenced in a positive sense and these scenes have been reduced , " says wanner .
the association continues to help boys escape the scene and it is the personal contact with its workers which has been credited with persuading many of those to change their lives .
however , to run the organization needs money and sub / way has to fight for its funding as it receives only minimal subsidies from the berlin senate .
only through private donations can sub / way continue to be there once a week for the rent boys of germany 's capital . dw staff -lrb- magnus rosengarten / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics . " if it actually becomes accepted that there were female apostles , the catholic church ca n't remain as it is , " the protestant said . hajo goertz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 pakistan president musharraf was condemned roundly on sunday for declaring a state of emergency in the country , a repeat of the gambit that brought him to power in 1999 .
the eu urged a " rapid return to democracy . " from diplomatically phrased expressions of regret from key allies in the worldwide fight against al qaeda , to fiery denunciations from his political rivals at home , the reaction to pakistan president pervez musharraf 's latest move was uniformly negative across the globe . eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concerns sunday about the state of emergency in pakistan , stressing that abandoning the democratic process is not the way to fight terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana " i am concerned by the declaration of a state of emergency in pakistan .
i recognize the difficulties pakistan is currently facing in its domestic political and security situation , " solana said in a statement .
" however , i believe that any deviation from the general democratic process can not be a solution . " he added : " specifically , i urge the authorities in pakistan to continue the preparations for the holding of general elections as scheduled . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced sunday " deep concern " at the state of emergency . " i hope for a return as quickly as possible to constitutional order , " he said in a statement issued by the foreign ministry in berlin . " civilian government , respect for the principle of the separation of powers , the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the media are of major importance to us . " suspending the constitution in a televised address to the nation , musharraf said he had imposed an emergency because terrorism in pakistan was at its peak while the government was in " semi-paralysis " through the behavior of the supreme court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf says acts of terrorism are increasing rapidly " the situation had been changing very fast .
terrorism and extremism are at their extreme , " musharraf said , citing a number of recent blasts including one in karachi that killed 139 people . musharraf , 64 , imposed the state of emergency in his capacity as army chief , suspending the constitution for the second time since he took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 . the move was apparently aimed at preventing a defiant judiciary from ruling against his re-election in last month 's controversial presidential vote .
he won overwhelmingly , but was challenged on the grounds that the constitution prohibits serving military officers from contesting elections . europe , us reject move in britain , foreign secretary david miliband stressed the need for pakistan to harness " the power of democracy and the rule of law to achieve the goals of stability , development and countering terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf " i am gravely concerned by the measures adopted today , which will take pakistan further from these goals , " said miliband in a statement . in paris , the ministry for foreign and european affairs voiced french " concern " at musharraf 's decision , urging him to " maintain the rule of law . "
france " wants dialogue between all pakistani political forces to guarantee stability and democracy in this great country which is a partner and a friend , " the ministry said in a statement . " this action is very disappointing , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement . " president musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in january and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office , " he said . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " whatever happens , we will be urging for a quick return to a constitutional order , we will be urging that the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we would be urging calm among the parties . " but a pentagon spokesman said washington at this point had no plans to suspend military aid to pakistan . closer to home reaction was more muted in india , pakistan 's neighbour and nuclear rival , with the country 's foreign ministry merely expressing its " regrets " at musharraf 's move . " we wish them stability and we look forward to conditions which will facilitate conditions for democracy to be restored in that country , " said india 's junior foreign minister anand sharma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signs for pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto but political parties allied to indian prime minister manmohan sigh 's congress-party ruling coalition reacted sharply , and the main opposition bjp party prodded new delhi to react strongly to the developments . " musharraf has shown his true colors as a military dictator and this imposition of emergency will not only have an impact in pakistan but also in the entire south asia region , " bjp spokesman rajiv pratap rudy warned . musharraf 's political rivals were similarly unsparing in their criticism .
pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto told britain 's sky news television that the country was regressing towards greater dictatorship under musharraf . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 pakistan president musharraf was condemned roundly on sunday for declaring a state of emergency in the country , a repeat of the gambit that brought him to power in 1999 .
the eu urged a " rapid return to democracy . " from diplomatically phrased expressions of regret from key allies in the worldwide fight against al qaeda , to fiery denunciations from his political rivals at home , the reaction to pakistan president pervez musharraf 's latest move was uniformly negative across the globe . eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concerns sunday about the state of emergency in pakistan , stressing that abandoning the democratic process is not the way to fight terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana " i am concerned by the declaration of a state of emergency in pakistan .
i recognize the difficulties pakistan is currently facing in its domestic political and security situation , " solana said in a statement .
" however , i believe that any deviation from the general democratic process can not be a solution . " he added : " specifically , i urge the authorities in pakistan to continue the preparations for the holding of general elections as scheduled . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced sunday " deep concern " at the state of emergency . " i hope for a return as quickly as possible to constitutional order , " he said in a statement issued by the foreign ministry in berlin . " civilian government , respect for the principle of the separation of powers , the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the media are of major importance to us . " suspending the constitution in a televised address to the nation , musharraf said he had imposed an emergency because terrorism in pakistan was at its peak while the government was in " semi-paralysis " through the behavior of the supreme court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf says acts of terrorism are increasing rapidly " the situation had been changing very fast .
terrorism and extremism are at their extreme , " musharraf said , citing a number of recent blasts including one in karachi that killed 139 people . musharraf , 64 , imposed the state of emergency in his capacity as army chief , suspending the constitution for the second time since he took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 . the move was apparently aimed at preventing a defiant judiciary from ruling against his re-election in last month 's controversial presidential vote .
he won overwhelmingly , but was challenged on the grounds that the constitution prohibits serving military officers from contesting elections . europe , us reject move in britain , foreign secretary david miliband stressed the need for pakistan to harness " the power of democracy and the rule of law to achieve the goals of stability , development and countering terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf " i am gravely concerned by the measures adopted today , which will take pakistan further from these goals , " said miliband in a statement . in paris , the ministry for foreign and european affairs voiced french " concern " at musharraf 's decision , urging him to " maintain the rule of law . "
france " wants dialogue between all pakistani political forces to guarantee stability and democracy in this great country which is a partner and a friend , " the ministry said in a statement . " this action is very disappointing , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement . " president musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in january and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office , " he said . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " whatever happens , we will be urging for a quick return to a constitutional order , we will be urging that the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we would be urging calm among the parties . " but a pentagon spokesman said washington at this point had no plans to suspend military aid to pakistan . closer to home reaction was more muted in india , pakistan 's neighbour and nuclear rival , with the country 's foreign ministry merely expressing its " regrets " at musharraf 's move . " we wish them stability and we look forward to conditions which will facilitate conditions for democracy to be restored in that country , " said india 's junior foreign minister anand sharma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signs for pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto but political parties allied to indian prime minister manmohan sigh 's congress-party ruling coalition reacted sharply , and the main opposition bjp party prodded new delhi to react strongly to the developments . " musharraf has shown his true colors as a military dictator and this imposition of emergency will not only have an impact in pakistan but also in the entire south asia region , " bjp spokesman rajiv pratap rudy warned . musharraf 's political rivals were similarly unsparing in their criticism .

terrorism and extremism are at their extreme , " musharraf said , citing a number of recent blasts including one in karachi that killed 139 people . musharraf , 64 , imposed the state of emergency in his capacity as army chief , suspending the constitution for the second time since he took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 . the move was apparently aimed at preventing a defiant judiciary from ruling against his re-election in last month 's controversial presidential vote .
he won overwhelmingly , but was challenged on the grounds that the constitution prohibits serving military officers from contesting elections . europe , us reject move in britain , foreign secretary david miliband stressed the need for pakistan to harness " the power of democracy and the rule of law to achieve the goals of stability , development and countering terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf " i am gravely concerned by the measures adopted today , which will take pakistan further from these goals , " said miliband in a statement . in paris , the ministry for foreign and european affairs voiced french " concern " at musharraf 's decision , urging him to " maintain the rule of law . "
france " wants dialogue between all pakistani political forces to guarantee stability and democracy in this great country which is a partner and a friend , " the ministry said in a statement . " this action is very disappointing , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement . " president musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in january and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office , " he said . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " whatever happens , we will be urging for a quick return to a constitutional order , we will be urging that the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we would be urging calm among the parties . " but a pentagon spokesman said washington at this point had no plans to suspend military aid to pakistan . closer to home reaction was more muted in india , pakistan 's neighbour and nuclear rival , with the country 's foreign ministry merely expressing its " regrets " at musharraf 's move . " we wish them stability and we look forward to conditions which will facilitate conditions for democracy to be restored in that country , " said india 's junior foreign minister anand sharma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signs for pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto but political parties allied to indian prime minister manmohan sigh 's congress-party ruling coalition reacted sharply , and the main opposition bjp party prodded new delhi to react strongly to the developments . " musharraf has shown his true colors as a military dictator and this imposition of emergency will not only have an impact in pakistan but also in the entire south asia region , " bjp spokesman rajiv pratap rudy warned . musharraf 's political rivals were similarly unsparing in their criticism .
pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto told britain 's sky news television that the country was regressing towards greater dictatorship under musharraf . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some fear an increase of racist violence . italian officials raised fears of an anti-romanian " vendetta " on saturday , nov .
3 , following apparent reprisal attacks the day before over the death of a woman allegedly killed by a romanian . " unfortunately , it 's what we fear , " interior minister giuliano amato told la repubblica daily of friday 's attacks against three romanians by masked men armed with sticks . " we must prevent this terrible tiger that is xenophobic hatred , the racist beast , from leaving its cage , " amato said . meanwhile , rome marked a day of mourning saturday for giovanna reggiani , a 47-year-old naval officer 's wife who was allegedly attacked and found comatose in a ditch outside rome .
she later died in a hospital . several hundred people attended her funeral saturday , including amato and rome 's mayor walter veltroni . expulsions a 24-year-old romanian youth was arrested tuesday and stands accused of being reggiani 's assailant , which he denies .
her assault prompted an emergency decree wednesday to facilitate expulsions of eu citizens considered a security threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funeral of giovanna reggiani in rome on saturday italians have fumed for years over petty crimes by poor immigrants from romania and elsewhere . after the attack on reggiani , prodi issued a decree opening the way for prefects to expel european union citizens who were considered dangerous .
the targets of the decree have so far been immigrants from romania , which joined the bloc this year , and have the same right as other eu citizens to travel freely across borders . " nobody imagined having to face 500,000 poor souls that in one year have left romania for italy , " interior minister giuliano amato said . a judge must sign off on an expulsion order but no criminal history is necessary and nor is a trial , according to the interior ministry . milan 's prefect gianvalerio lombardi expelled the first four romanians on friday .
four new expulsion orders were signed on saturday , according to italy 's ansa news agency .
authorities in northern turin , genoa , val d 'aosta and lecce in southern italy also followed suit saturday , the news agency reported . all the decrees must be approved by judges to take effect and they only last three years .
those expelled have a month to leave the country . last year 15.4 percent of foreigners accused of murder , sexual violence and theft in italy were romanian , police say . concern over reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian police officer destroys makeshift houses on the tiber river banks friday 's attack against the three romanians at a supermarket parking lot by 10 masked men armed with sticks , knives and iron bars has raised concern of reprisals against ordinary members of the romanian community , italy 's largest immigrant group . initial reports said four were targeted in the attack in a southern roman suburb , near shantytowns where foreigners live in squalor . the most seriously injured , emil marcu , 47 , was in stable condition following an overnight operation , according to hospital sources quoted by ansa .
witnesses told police the assailants , who fled the scene , were italian . reaction to the assaults was swift , with italian media linking the incident to reggiani 's death - although the two events occurred some 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- apart - and politicians of all stripes warning against reprisals against romanians . " we must avoid at all cost a spiral of vendettas to be established , " said fabrizio cicchitto of the conservative forza italia party of former prime minister silvio berlusconi . rome mayor veltroni , recently crowned the new leader of italy 's center-left and the heir apparent to prime minister romano prodi , also urged people to " be inspired by the values of civil society , and not by vendetta . " still , the attacks have sparked partisan sparring , with the left accusing the right of using the tragedy for their political ends and berlusconi charging the leftist government of being lax on security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 04.11.2007 theologians at odds over german pc bible großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible has women at the table , too a year since it was published , a politically correct german translation of the bible remains controversial .
germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 04.11.2007 helping berlin 's male prostitutes one night at a time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male sex workers are often overlooked by counseling services when one hears about prostitution , one normally thinks of women forced to sell their sexual services for money .
the fact that young men also find their way onto the streets is less well known . in berlin , as in most major cities , boys and young men from as young as 14-years old work the curbs , sex cinemas and gay bars of the german capital .
the fact that the rent boys of berlin barely register on most people 's radars led to the creation of an association in 1992 to help those in prostitution .
the employees of " sub / way " visit the districts of berlin where the boys work and supply them with condoms and advice on how to be safe on the streets .
once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .
the first stop is usually a berlin train station where rent boys , many of whom have drug problems , punt for clients .
the van is watched with interest and a little suspicion until a couple of boys come over and ask for hot chocolate .
social workers form a bond with rent boys helmut wanner is a social worker with sub / way and looks after the rent boys , knows them by name and knows many of their life stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " marikas " is bavaria 's only counseling center for male prostitutes over the course of the years , he has built up a trust with many of them and despite what many people think of their lives and their work ; he has a certain amount of respect for them .
when a tragedy strikes , he feels it more than most .
" it 's terrible when somebody dies , which unfortunately seems to happen a lot , " wanner says .
" others do n't have it as bad but there is still a lot of sadness . "
later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys . # b # " on the most part you can be sure that they have very little or no education at all , " says prinalski .
" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "
easiest way to money for some towards the end of the night , the sub / way team visit the bars where the mostly eastern european boys sell themselves .
there they sit on bar stools and wait for their customers .
their fresh , young faces make it hard to believe that these boys are on the game but for most , this is the only employment they can get .
" this is the only way they can earn something , " says prinalski .
" the reality is that for a migrant with or without papers , this is the easiest and least complicated way to get work . "
circling the boys are the potential clients for the night , mainly older men .
they eye each boy individually and touch them before making the decision .
for the sub / way team , this is one of the hardest sights they have to deal with .
but optimism and success is their reward .
" many lives have been influenced in a positive sense and these scenes have been reduced , " says wanner .
the association continues to help boys escape the scene and it is the personal contact with its workers which has been credited with persuading many of those to change their lives .
however , to run the organization needs money and sub / way has to fight for its funding as it receives only minimal subsidies from the berlin senate .
only through private donations can sub / way continue to be there once a week for the rent boys of germany 's capital . dw staff -lrb- magnus rosengarten / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 pakistan president musharraf was condemned roundly on sunday for declaring a state of emergency in the country , a repeat of the gambit that brought him to power in 1999 .
the eu urged a " rapid return to democracy . " from diplomatically phrased expressions of regret from key allies in the worldwide fight against al qaeda , to fiery denunciations from his political rivals at home , the reaction to pakistan president pervez musharraf 's latest move was uniformly negative across the globe . eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concerns sunday about the state of emergency in pakistan , stressing that abandoning the democratic process is not the way to fight terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana " i am concerned by the declaration of a state of emergency in pakistan .
i recognize the difficulties pakistan is currently facing in its domestic political and security situation , " solana said in a statement .
" however , i believe that any deviation from the general democratic process can not be a solution . " he added : " specifically , i urge the authorities in pakistan to continue the preparations for the holding of general elections as scheduled . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced sunday " deep concern " at the state of emergency . " i hope for a return as quickly as possible to constitutional order , " he said in a statement issued by the foreign ministry in berlin . " civilian government , respect for the principle of the separation of powers , the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the media are of major importance to us . " suspending the constitution in a televised address to the nation , musharraf said he had imposed an emergency because terrorism in pakistan was at its peak while the government was in " semi-paralysis " through the behavior of the supreme court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf says acts of terrorism are increasing rapidly " the situation had been changing very fast .
terrorism and extremism are at their extreme , " musharraf said , citing a number of recent blasts including one in karachi that killed 139 people . musharraf , 64 , imposed the state of emergency in his capacity as army chief , suspending the constitution for the second time since he took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 . the move was apparently aimed at preventing a defiant judiciary from ruling against his re-election in last month 's controversial presidential vote .
he won overwhelmingly , but was challenged on the grounds that the constitution prohibits serving military officers from contesting elections . europe , us reject move in britain , foreign secretary david miliband stressed the need for pakistan to harness " the power of democracy and the rule of law to achieve the goals of stability , development and countering terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf " i am gravely concerned by the measures adopted today , which will take pakistan further from these goals , " said miliband in a statement . in paris , the ministry for foreign and european affairs voiced french " concern " at musharraf 's decision , urging him to " maintain the rule of law . "
france " wants dialogue between all pakistani political forces to guarantee stability and democracy in this great country which is a partner and a friend , " the ministry said in a statement . " this action is very disappointing , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement . " president musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in january and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office , " he said . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " whatever happens , we will be urging for a quick return to a constitutional order , we will be urging that the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we would be urging calm among the parties . " but a pentagon spokesman said washington at this point had no plans to suspend military aid to pakistan . closer to home reaction was more muted in india , pakistan 's neighbour and nuclear rival , with the country 's foreign ministry merely expressing its " regrets " at musharraf 's move . " we wish them stability and we look forward to conditions which will facilitate conditions for democracy to be restored in that country , " said india 's junior foreign minister anand sharma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signs for pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto but political parties allied to indian prime minister manmohan sigh 's congress-party ruling coalition reacted sharply , and the main opposition bjp party prodded new delhi to react strongly to the developments .

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics .

some fear an increase of racist violence . italian officials raised fears of an anti-romanian " vendetta " on saturday , nov .
3 , following apparent reprisal attacks the day before over the death of a woman allegedly killed by a romanian . " unfortunately , it 's what we fear , " interior minister giuliano amato told la repubblica daily of friday 's attacks against three romanians by masked men armed with sticks . " we must prevent this terrible tiger that is xenophobic hatred , the racist beast , from leaving its cage , " amato said . meanwhile , rome marked a day of mourning saturday for giovanna reggiani , a 47-year-old naval officer 's wife who was allegedly attacked and found comatose in a ditch outside rome .
she later died in a hospital . several hundred people attended her funeral saturday , including amato and rome 's mayor walter veltroni . expulsions a 24-year-old romanian youth was arrested tuesday and stands accused of being reggiani 's assailant , which he denies .
her assault prompted an emergency decree wednesday to facilitate expulsions of eu citizens considered a security threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funeral of giovanna reggiani in rome on saturday italians have fumed for years over petty crimes by poor immigrants from romania and elsewhere . after the attack on reggiani , prodi issued a decree opening the way for prefects to expel european union citizens who were considered dangerous .
the targets of the decree have so far been immigrants from romania , which joined the bloc this year , and have the same right as other eu citizens to travel freely across borders . " nobody imagined having to face 500,000 poor souls that in one year have left romania for italy , " interior minister giuliano amato said . a judge must sign off on an expulsion order but no criminal history is necessary and nor is a trial , according to the interior ministry . milan 's prefect gianvalerio lombardi expelled the first four romanians on friday .
four new expulsion orders were signed on saturday , according to italy 's ansa news agency .
authorities in northern turin , genoa , val d 'aosta and lecce in southern italy also followed suit saturday , the news agency reported . all the decrees must be approved by judges to take effect and they only last three years .
those expelled have a month to leave the country . last year 15.4 percent of foreigners accused of murder , sexual violence and theft in italy were romanian , police say . concern over reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian police officer destroys makeshift houses on the tiber river banks friday 's attack against the three romanians at a supermarket parking lot by 10 masked men armed with sticks , knives and iron bars has raised concern of reprisals against ordinary members of the romanian community , italy 's largest immigrant group . initial reports said four were targeted in the attack in a southern roman suburb , near shantytowns where foreigners live in squalor . the most seriously injured , emil marcu , 47 , was in stable condition following an overnight operation , according to hospital sources quoted by ansa .
witnesses told police the assailants , who fled the scene , were italian . reaction to the assaults was swift , with italian media linking the incident to reggiani 's death - although the two events occurred some 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- apart - and politicians of all stripes warning against reprisals against romanians . " we must avoid at all cost a spiral of vendettas to be established , " said fabrizio cicchitto of the conservative forza italia party of former prime minister silvio berlusconi . rome mayor veltroni , recently crowned the new leader of italy 's center-left and the heir apparent to prime minister romano prodi , also urged people to " be inspired by the values of civil society , and not by vendetta . " still , the attacks have sparked partisan sparring , with the left accusing the right of using the tragedy for their political ends and berlusconi charging the leftist government of being lax on security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics .

" unfortunately , it 's what we fear , " interior minister giuliano amato told la repubblica daily of friday 's attacks against three romanians by masked men armed with sticks . " we must prevent this terrible tiger that is xenophobic hatred , the racist beast , from leaving its cage , " amato said . meanwhile , rome marked a day of mourning saturday for giovanna reggiani , a 47-year-old naval officer 's wife who was allegedly attacked and found comatose in a ditch outside rome .
she later died in a hospital . several hundred people attended her funeral saturday , including amato and rome 's mayor walter veltroni . expulsions a 24-year-old romanian youth was arrested tuesday and stands accused of being reggiani 's assailant , which he denies .

witnesses told police the assailants , who fled the scene , were italian . reaction to the assaults was swift , with italian media linking the incident to reggiani 's death - although the two events occurred some 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- apart - and politicians of all stripes warning against reprisals against romanians .

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics . " if it actually becomes accepted that there were female apostles , the catholic church ca n't remain as it is , " the protestant said . hajo goertz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 pakistan president musharraf was condemned roundly on sunday for declaring a state of emergency in the country , a repeat of the gambit that brought him to power in 1999 .
the eu urged a " rapid return to democracy . " from diplomatically phrased expressions of regret from key allies in the worldwide fight against al qaeda , to fiery denunciations from his political rivals at home , the reaction to pakistan president pervez musharraf 's latest move was uniformly negative across the globe . eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concerns sunday about the state of emergency in pakistan , stressing that abandoning the democratic process is not the way to fight terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana " i am concerned by the declaration of a state of emergency in pakistan .
i recognize the difficulties pakistan is currently facing in its domestic political and security situation , " solana said in a statement .
" however , i believe that any deviation from the general democratic process can not be a solution . " he added : " specifically , i urge the authorities in pakistan to continue the preparations for the holding of general elections as scheduled . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced sunday " deep concern " at the state of emergency . " i hope for a return as quickly as possible to constitutional order , " he said in a statement issued by the foreign ministry in berlin . " civilian government , respect for the principle of the separation of powers , the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the media are of major importance to us .

terrorism and extremism are at their extreme , " musharraf said , citing a number of recent blasts including one in karachi that killed 139 people . musharraf , 64 , imposed the state of emergency in his capacity as army chief , suspending the constitution for the second time since he took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 . the move was apparently aimed at preventing a defiant judiciary from ruling against his re-election in last month 's controversial presidential vote .
he won overwhelmingly , but was challenged on the grounds that the constitution prohibits serving military officers from contesting elections . europe , us reject move in britain , foreign secretary david miliband stressed the need for pakistan to harness " the power of democracy and the rule of law to achieve the goals of stability , development and countering terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf " i am gravely concerned by the measures adopted today , which will take pakistan further from these goals , " said miliband in a statement . in paris , the ministry for foreign and european affairs voiced french " concern " at musharraf 's decision , urging him to " maintain the rule of law . "
france " wants dialogue between all pakistani political forces to guarantee stability and democracy in this great country which is a partner and a friend , " the ministry said in a statement . " this action is very disappointing , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement . " president musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in january and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office , " he said . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " whatever happens , we will be urging for a quick return to a constitutional order , we will be urging that the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we would be urging calm among the parties . " but a pentagon spokesman said washington at this point had no plans to suspend military aid to pakistan . closer to home reaction was more muted in india , pakistan 's neighbour and nuclear rival , with the country 's foreign ministry merely expressing its " regrets " at musharraf 's move .

the fact that young men also find their way onto the streets is less well known . in berlin , as in most major cities , boys and young men from as young as 14-years old work the curbs , sex cinemas and gay bars of the german capital .
the fact that the rent boys of berlin barely register on most people 's radars led to the creation of an association in 1992 to help those in prostitution .
the employees of " sub / way " visit the districts of berlin where the boys work and supply them with condoms and advice on how to be safe on the streets .
once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .
the first stop is usually a berlin train station where rent boys , many of whom have drug problems , punt for clients .
the van is watched with interest and a little suspicion until a couple of boys come over and ask for hot chocolate .
social workers form a bond with rent boys helmut wanner is a social worker with sub / way and looks after the rent boys , knows them by name and knows many of their life stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " marikas " is bavaria 's only counseling center for male prostitutes over the course of the years , he has built up a trust with many of them and despite what many people think of their lives and their work ; he has a certain amount of respect for them .
when a tragedy strikes , he feels it more than most .
" it 's terrible when somebody dies , which unfortunately seems to happen a lot , " wanner says .
" others do n't have it as bad but there is still a lot of sadness . "
later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys . # b # " on the most part you can be sure that they have very little or no education at all , " says prinalski .
" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "
easiest way to money for some towards the end of the night , the sub / way team visit the bars where the mostly eastern european boys sell themselves .
there they sit on bar stools and wait for their customers .
their fresh , young faces make it hard to believe that these boys are on the game but for most , this is the only employment they can get .
" this is the only way they can earn something , " says prinalski .
" the reality is that for a migrant with or without papers , this is the easiest and least complicated way to get work . "
circling the boys are the potential clients for the night , mainly older men .
they eye each boy individually and touch them before making the decision .
for the sub / way team , this is one of the hardest sights they have to deal with .
but optimism and success is their reward .
" many lives have been influenced in a positive sense and these scenes have been reduced , " says wanner .
the association continues to help boys escape the scene and it is the personal contact with its workers which has been credited with persuading many of those to change their lives .
however , to run the organization needs money and sub / way has to fight for its funding as it receives only minimal subsidies from the berlin senate .
only through private donations can sub / way continue to be there once a week for the rent boys of germany 's capital . dw staff -lrb- magnus rosengarten / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 04.11.2007 theologians at odds over german pc bible großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible has women at the table , too a year since it was published , a politically correct german translation of the bible remains controversial .
germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics . " if it actually becomes accepted that there were female apostles , the catholic church ca n't remain as it is , " the protestant said . hajo goertz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that young men also find their way onto the streets is less well known . in berlin , as in most major cities , boys and young men from as young as 14-years old work the curbs , sex cinemas and gay bars of the german capital .
the fact that the rent boys of berlin barely register on most people 's radars led to the creation of an association in 1992 to help those in prostitution .
the employees of " sub / way " visit the districts of berlin where the boys work and supply them with condoms and advice on how to be safe on the streets .
once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .
the first stop is usually a berlin train station where rent boys , many of whom have drug problems , punt for clients .
the van is watched with interest and a little suspicion until a couple of boys come over and ask for hot chocolate .

" it 's terrible when somebody dies , which unfortunately seems to happen a lot , " wanner says .
" others do n't have it as bad but there is still a lot of sadness . "
later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys .

" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics .

once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .
the first stop is usually a berlin train station where rent boys , many of whom have drug problems , punt for clients .
the van is watched with interest and a little suspicion until a couple of boys come over and ask for hot chocolate .
social workers form a bond with rent boys helmut wanner is a social worker with sub / way and looks after the rent boys , knows them by name and knows many of their life stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " marikas " is bavaria 's only counseling center for male prostitutes over the course of the years , he has built up a trust with many of them and despite what many people think of their lives and their work ; he has a certain amount of respect for them .
when a tragedy strikes , he feels it more than most .
" it 's terrible when somebody dies , which unfortunately seems to happen a lot , " wanner says .
" others do n't have it as bad but there is still a lot of sadness . "
later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys . # b # " on the most part you can be sure that they have very little or no education at all , " says prinalski .
" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "
easiest way to money for some towards the end of the night , the sub / way team visit the bars where the mostly eastern european boys sell themselves .
there they sit on bar stools and wait for their customers .
their fresh , young faces make it hard to believe that these boys are on the game but for most , this is the only employment they can get .
" this is the only way they can earn something , " says prinalski .
" the reality is that for a migrant with or without papers , this is the easiest and least complicated way to get work . "
circling the boys are the potential clients for the night , mainly older men .
they eye each boy individually and touch them before making the decision .
for the sub / way team , this is one of the hardest sights they have to deal with .
but optimism and success is their reward .
" many lives have been influenced in a positive sense and these scenes have been reduced , " says wanner .
the association continues to help boys escape the scene and it is the personal contact with its workers which has been credited with persuading many of those to change their lives .
however , to run the organization needs money and sub / way has to fight for its funding as it receives only minimal subsidies from the berlin senate .
only through private donations can sub / way continue to be there once a week for the rent boys of germany 's capital . dw staff -lrb- magnus rosengarten / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics .

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics . " if it actually becomes accepted that there were female apostles , the catholic church ca n't remain as it is , " the protestant said . hajo goertz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that young men also find their way onto the streets is less well known . in berlin , as in most major cities , boys and young men from as young as 14-years old work the curbs , sex cinemas and gay bars of the german capital .
the fact that the rent boys of berlin barely register on most people 's radars led to the creation of an association in 1992 to help those in prostitution .
the employees of " sub / way " visit the districts of berlin where the boys work and supply them with condoms and advice on how to be safe on the streets .
once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .
the first stop is usually a berlin train station where rent boys , many of whom have drug problems , punt for clients .
the van is watched with interest and a little suspicion until a couple of boys come over and ask for hot chocolate .
social workers form a bond with rent boys helmut wanner is a social worker with sub / way and looks after the rent boys , knows them by name and knows many of their life stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " marikas " is bavaria 's only counseling center for male prostitutes over the course of the years , he has built up a trust with many of them and despite what many people think of their lives and their work ; he has a certain amount of respect for them .
when a tragedy strikes , he feels it more than most .
" it 's terrible when somebody dies , which unfortunately seems to happen a lot , " wanner says .
" others do n't have it as bad but there is still a lot of sadness . "
later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys . # b # " on the most part you can be sure that they have very little or no education at all , " says prinalski .
" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .

4 pakistan president musharraf was condemned roundly on sunday for declaring a state of emergency in the country , a repeat of the gambit that brought him to power in 1999 .
the eu urged a " rapid return to democracy . " from diplomatically phrased expressions of regret from key allies in the worldwide fight against al qaeda , to fiery denunciations from his political rivals at home , the reaction to pakistan president pervez musharraf 's latest move was uniformly negative across the globe . eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concerns sunday about the state of emergency in pakistan , stressing that abandoning the democratic process is not the way to fight terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana " i am concerned by the declaration of a state of emergency in pakistan .
i recognize the difficulties pakistan is currently facing in its domestic political and security situation , " solana said in a statement .
" however , i believe that any deviation from the general democratic process can not be a solution . " he added : " specifically , i urge the authorities in pakistan to continue the preparations for the holding of general elections as scheduled . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier voiced sunday " deep concern " at the state of emergency . " i hope for a return as quickly as possible to constitutional order , " he said in a statement issued by the foreign ministry in berlin . " civilian government , respect for the principle of the separation of powers , the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the media are of major importance to us .

terrorism and extremism are at their extreme , " musharraf said , citing a number of recent blasts including one in karachi that killed 139 people . musharraf , 64 , imposed the state of emergency in his capacity as army chief , suspending the constitution for the second time since he took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 . the move was apparently aimed at preventing a defiant judiciary from ruling against his re-election in last month 's controversial presidential vote .
he won overwhelmingly , but was challenged on the grounds that the constitution prohibits serving military officers from contesting elections . europe , us reject move in britain , foreign secretary david miliband stressed the need for pakistan to harness " the power of democracy and the rule of law to achieve the goals of stability , development and countering terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf " i am gravely concerned by the measures adopted today , which will take pakistan further from these goals , " said miliband in a statement . in paris , the ministry for foreign and european affairs voiced french " concern " at musharraf 's decision , urging him to " maintain the rule of law . "
france " wants dialogue between all pakistani political forces to guarantee stability and democracy in this great country which is a partner and a friend , " the ministry said in a statement . " this action is very disappointing , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe in a statement . " president musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in january and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office , " he said . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " whatever happens , we will be urging for a quick return to a constitutional order , we will be urging that the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we would be urging calm among the parties . " but a pentagon spokesman said washington at this point had no plans to suspend military aid to pakistan . closer to home reaction was more muted in india , pakistan 's neighbour and nuclear rival , with the country 's foreign ministry merely expressing its " regrets " at musharraf 's move . " we wish them stability and we look forward to conditions which will facilitate conditions for democracy to be restored in that country , " said india 's junior foreign minister anand sharma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signs for pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto but political parties allied to indian prime minister manmohan sigh 's congress-party ruling coalition reacted sharply , and the main opposition bjp party prodded new delhi to react strongly to the developments . " musharraf has shown his true colors as a military dictator and this imposition of emergency will not only have an impact in pakistan but also in the entire south asia region , " bjp spokesman rajiv pratap rudy warned . musharraf 's political rivals were similarly unsparing in their criticism .

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics . " if it actually becomes accepted that there were female apostles , the catholic church ca n't remain as it is , " the protestant said . hajo goertz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .
but the 2,400-page book has polarized both theologians and laypeople , some of whom feel like their beliefs are under attack .
" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .
high time , feminists say a critic herself , catholic theologian helen schüngel-straumann said a new approach had been long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pc bible is a far cry from martin luther 's version for years , we as feminist theologians … had fought for something to happen when it came to equitable language , " she said , adding that it had been high on their agenda for decades .
still , she disapproves of the new translation , which she said falsified historical truth .
it blurs social relations within a patriarchal society , which is important to grasp to understand the text , she said .
the swiss theologian did view as positive the departure from the traditional perception of god as male .
but she said the new translation could not replace previous versions , including that of martin luther , adding that it was instead useful to provoke thought .
challenge to church structures ?
despite her reservations , pastor büttner also sees benefits to the project , which has succeeded in drawing new attention to the bible .
she has seen it spark criticism of the church , she said - at least from catholics . " if it actually becomes accepted that there were female apostles , the catholic church ca n't remain as it is , " the protestant said . hajo goertz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top protestants have called it an adulteration , but even critics admit it has its uses . the " bibel in gerechter sprache , " or the bible in equitable language , was meant as a modern translation that would make women more visible , correct anti-jewish formulations and draw attention to social issues .

" the bible does n't only offer paradigms , but rather it speaks to the heart of people 's existence , " said pastor margit büttner .
" when that 's suddenly called into question , when suddenly i 'm not supposed to pray ' our father in heaven , ' but am told : jesus instructed his male and female disciples , you should pray : our father and mother in heaven - that can put off people . "
the new translation , the work of more than 50 theologians , consistently mentions women wherever men are mentioned , even at the risk of distorting the bible 's historical setting and departing from the hebrew and greek originals .
thus the book refers to female and male rabbis , although the first women rabbis were not ordained until the 1970s .

" unfortunately , it 's what we fear , " interior minister giuliano amato told la repubblica daily of friday 's attacks against three romanians by masked men armed with sticks . " we must prevent this terrible tiger that is xenophobic hatred , the racist beast , from leaving its cage , " amato said . meanwhile , rome marked a day of mourning saturday for giovanna reggiani , a 47-year-old naval officer 's wife who was allegedly attacked and found comatose in a ditch outside rome .
she later died in a hospital . several hundred people attended her funeral saturday , including amato and rome 's mayor walter veltroni . expulsions a 24-year-old romanian youth was arrested tuesday and stands accused of being reggiani 's assailant , which he denies .
her assault prompted an emergency decree wednesday to facilitate expulsions of eu citizens considered a security threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funeral of giovanna reggiani in rome on saturday italians have fumed for years over petty crimes by poor immigrants from romania and elsewhere . after the attack on reggiani , prodi issued a decree opening the way for prefects to expel european union citizens who were considered dangerous .
the targets of the decree have so far been immigrants from romania , which joined the bloc this year , and have the same right as other eu citizens to travel freely across borders . " nobody imagined having to face 500,000 poor souls that in one year have left romania for italy , " interior minister giuliano amato said . a judge must sign off on an expulsion order but no criminal history is necessary and nor is a trial , according to the interior ministry . milan 's prefect gianvalerio lombardi expelled the first four romanians on friday .
four new expulsion orders were signed on saturday , according to italy 's ansa news agency .
authorities in northern turin , genoa , val d 'aosta and lecce in southern italy also followed suit saturday , the news agency reported . all the decrees must be approved by judges to take effect and they only last three years .
those expelled have a month to leave the country . last year 15.4 percent of foreigners accused of murder , sexual violence and theft in italy were romanian , police say . concern over reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian police officer destroys makeshift houses on the tiber river banks friday 's attack against the three romanians at a supermarket parking lot by 10 masked men armed with sticks , knives and iron bars has raised concern of reprisals against ordinary members of the romanian community , italy 's largest immigrant group . initial reports said four were targeted in the attack in a southern roman suburb , near shantytowns where foreigners live in squalor . the most seriously injured , emil marcu , 47 , was in stable condition following an overnight operation , according to hospital sources quoted by ansa .
witnesses told police the assailants , who fled the scene , were italian . reaction to the assaults was swift , with italian media linking the incident to reggiani 's death - although the two events occurred some 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- apart - and politicians of all stripes warning against reprisals against romanians . " we must avoid at all cost a spiral of vendettas to be established , " said fabrizio cicchitto of the conservative forza italia party of former prime minister silvio berlusconi . rome mayor veltroni , recently crowned the new leader of italy 's center-left and the heir apparent to prime minister romano prodi , also urged people to " be inspired by the values of civil society , and not by vendetta . " still , the attacks have sparked partisan sparring , with the left accusing the right of using the tragedy for their political ends and berlusconi charging the leftist government of being lax on security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that young men also find their way onto the streets is less well known . in berlin , as in most major cities , boys and young men from as young as 14-years old work the curbs , sex cinemas and gay bars of the german capital .
the fact that the rent boys of berlin barely register on most people 's radars led to the creation of an association in 1992 to help those in prostitution .
the employees of " sub / way " visit the districts of berlin where the boys work and supply them with condoms and advice on how to be safe on the streets .
once a week , the sub / way team loads their van up with condoms , lubricants , sexual health pamphlets , instant soups and hot chocolate before entering the dark underbelly of the german capital .
the first stop is usually a berlin train station where rent boys , many of whom have drug problems , punt for clients .
the van is watched with interest and a little suspicion until a couple of boys come over and ask for hot chocolate .
social workers form a bond with rent boys helmut wanner is a social worker with sub / way and looks after the rent boys , knows them by name and knows many of their life stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is often the easiest way to make money over the course of the years , he has built up a trust with many of them and despite what many people think of their lives and their work ; he has a certain amount of respect for them .
when a tragedy strikes , he feels it more than most .
" it 's terrible when somebody dies , which unfortunately seems to happen a lot , " wanner says .
" others do n't have it as bad but there is still a lot of sadness . "
later in the evening , the sub / way team move onto the areas of berlin where male prostitutes , many working for their next fix and any money they can get , loiter on the edges of dark streets waiting for clients .
a large transvestite and transsexual contingent works the street ; boys in high heels and mini-skirts mix with those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery .
majority of male prostitutes come from eastern europe some 80 percent of male prostitutes in berlin are not native germans , most coming from bulgaria and romania , and sergio prinalski , the sub / way translator , helps the social workers to interact with these boys .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " marikas " is bavaria 's only counseling center for male prostitutes " on the most part you can be sure that they have very little or no education at all , " says prinalski .
" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "
easiest way to money for some towards the end of the night , the sub / way team visit the bars where the mostly eastern european boys sell themselves .
there they sit on bar stools and wait for their customers .
their fresh , young faces make it hard to believe that these boys are on the game but for most , this is the only employment they can get .
" this is the only way they can earn something , " says prinalski .
" the reality is that for a migrant with or without papers , this is the easiest and least complicated way to get work . "
circling the boys are the potential clients for the night , mainly older men .
they eye each boy individually and touch them before making the decision .
for the sub / way team , this is one of the hardest sights they have to deal with .
but optimism and success is their reward .
" many lives have been influenced in a positive sense and these scenes have been reduced , " says wanner .
the association continues to help boys escape the scene and it is the personal contact with its workers which has been credited with persuading many of those to change their lives .
however , to run the organization needs money and sub / way has to fight for its funding as it receives only minimal subsidies from the berlin senate .
only through private donations can sub / way continue to be there once a week for the rent boys of germany 's capital . dw staff -lrb- magnus rosengarten / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " marikas " is bavaria 's only counseling center for male prostitutes " on the most part you can be sure that they have very little or no education at all , " says prinalski .
" these are the people who go on the game for economic reasons . "
sub / way does n't only work with the boys on the streets .
its drop-in center in berlin offers the boys washing , sleeping and eating facilities as well as advice and medical help .
the workers there also help to put the boys into contact with each other , to share stories and find companions .
it is a lonely and dangerous life which does n't often provide the kind of income that might compensate for the dangers .
" there are no steady price ranges in the scene , " says wanner .
" i imagine , 50 euros is a usual price for penetrative sex but often the boys do n't even get paid .
sometimes it can go for only a few euros when someone is desperate . "
easiest way to money for some towards the end of the night , the sub / way team visit the bars where the mostly eastern european boys sell themselves .
there they sit on bar stools and wait for their customers .
their fresh , young faces make it hard to believe that these boys are on the game but for most , this is the only employment they can get .
" this is the only way they can earn something , " says prinalski .
" the reality is that for a migrant with or without papers , this is the easiest and least complicated way to get work . "
circling the boys are the potential clients for the night , mainly older men .
they eye each boy individually and touch them before making the decision .
for the sub / way team , this is one of the hardest sights they have to deal with .
but optimism and success is their reward .
" many lives have been influenced in a positive sense and these scenes have been reduced , " says wanner .
the association continues to help boys escape the scene and it is the personal contact with its workers which has been credited with persuading many of those to change their lives .
however , to run the organization needs money and sub / way has to fight for its funding as it receives only minimal subsidies from the berlin senate .
only through private donations can sub / way continue to be there once a week for the rent boys of germany 's capital . dw staff -lrb- magnus rosengarten / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over many centuries , they developed a method for preserving bodies using natural chemicals and strips of fabric so they would remain life-like .
mummification was based on the belief that the body must be preserved as a home in the afterlife for part of the person 's soul .
the entire mummification process took about 70 days .
initially , it was used only for kings but eventually it was available to everyone .
step one : preparation before starting , organs - with the exception of the heart - were removed and stored in jars .
the brain was removed via the nose and discarded .
step two : preservation the ancient egyptians used natural salts , minerals and oils to preserve bodies .
they were left out to dry for 40 or 50 days , by which time only hair , skin and bone were left .
step three : wrapping the corpse was wrapped in strips of linen , starting with the head and neck .
good luck charms known as amulets were placed under the fabric as the body was being bound .
they were believed to protect the owner on the journey to the afterlife .
while the body was being wrapped , a priest recited spells and prayers and , as a further measure to ward off evil spirits , a papyrus scroll of texts known as the book of the dead was placed in the mummy 's hands .
the embalmers continued wrapping the body with linen coated in a resin that acted like glue .
step four : funeral the body was wrapped in a final layer of cloth before being placed under a board of painted wood and lowered into a coffin .

they lost a head-to-head battle with girl group hope during saturday 's programme , with both acts having been mentored by judge simon cowell .
cowell said he would let hope stay as they had better " long-term potential " .
saturday 's programme did not feature emily nakanda , the 15-year-old who withdrew when a video was released , allegedly showing her attacking a girl .
" this week , serious allegations about aggressive behaviour came to light involving one of our contestants , " presenter dermot o 'leary told viewers at the start of the show .
" the producers have carried out a thorough investigation in conjunction with emily 's family , and this has resulted in emily withdrawing from the x factor .
" for the remaining nine acts the competition continues . "
on friday the teenager 's mother , louis friberg , issued a statement saying emily " regrets her actions " .
but she stressed her family would not excuse behaviour which had let the show - and viewers - down .
' poor song choice ' the climax to saturday 's programme saw futureproof performing the andy williams song ca n't take my eyes off you , while hope sang madonna 's hanky panky .
" there was one performance -lsb- that was -rsb- slick and energetic - the other was sloppy , " said judge louis walsh .
" the act i 'm sending home tonight is futureproof . "
fellow judge sharon osbourne stressed she did not want to eliminate either group .
but deciding who would stay , she said : " i go for the girls - i love the girls .
i have to send home futureproof . "
dannii minogue was more critical in her assessment of the night 's renditions , telling the two acts : " i do n't think either of you did a great performance , and i do n't think the song choice for the boys was good at all .
" i 'm going to judge it not just on tonight 's performance but over the shows that we 've done so far .
the boys have always come up trumps , so i have to send home hope . "
it was left to cowell to pick one of his two acts to leave the show .
" i 'm going to make this decision on who i think has the best long-term potential , because i 'm not going to judge it on tonight 's performance , " he said .
" i 'm going to send home futureproof . "
futureproof 's members were adam chandler , aaron delahunty , matthew protheroe , sean rumsey , richard wilkinson .
the five contestants forming hope were emily biggs , phoebe brown , raquelle gracie , leah lauder and charlie mole .
meanwhile in the race for ratings on saturday night , the x factor lost out to rival show strictly come dancing , according to overnight estimates .
the bbc one programme was seen by an average of 8.7 million viewers , with results announced in a separate sunday show .
the first part of the x factor scored 7.8 million , with its results show dropping to 6.6 million .

cowell said he would let hope stay as they had better " long-term potential " .
saturday 's programme did not feature emily nakanda , the 15-year-old who withdrew when a video was released , allegedly showing her attacking a girl .
" this week , serious allegations about aggressive behaviour came to light involving one of our contestants , " presenter dermot o 'leary told viewers at the start of the show .
emily nakanda has " sincerely apologised " for her behaviour " the producers have carried out a thorough investigation in conjunction with emily 's family , and this has resulted in emily withdrawing from the x factor .
" for the remaining nine acts the competition continues . "

" i 'm going to judge it not just on tonight 's performance but over the shows that we 've done so far .
the boys have always come up trumps , so i have to send home hope . "
it was left to cowell to pick one of his two acts to leave the show .
" i 'm going to make this decision on who i think has the best long-term potential , because i 'm not going to judge it on tonight 's performance , " he said .

the white line has been painted up to the edge of the pavement around the front of the station to mark out the no smoking area under a canopy .
midland mainline , who run the station , said it had put the line in place at the request of derby city council .
but the city council said midland mainline had taken the advice too far .
' belt and braces ' councillor richard smalley , from derby city council , said the council did not specifically tell midland mainline to paint the lines but did say the area under the entrance canopy had to be a no smoking zone .
he said : " this is something midland mainline has done of its own accord .
" we asked them to assign this area -lsb- underneath the canopy -rsb- as a non-smoking area and they have decided to adopt a belt and braces approach .
" it is important that they comply with the legislation and the city council is committed by the government to make sure we enforce the legislation .
if midland mainline wish to adopt this approach , it is their decision to do so . "
midland mainline declined to make any further comment .
