there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .

" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.06.2007 german rider admits to doping from notorious spanish doctor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg jaksche is the first rider to break the silence on the subject jörg jaksche of germany has become the first cyclist to confess to doping with the help of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes , the chief suspect in a massive spanish doping probe . jaksche told german news magazine der spiegel , in a report made available saturday ahead of monday 's publication , that he used performance-enhancing drugs since 1997 .
they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

still , germany lags behind in the e-love trend . helen morrison was a pioneer of modern love : in 1727 she placed the first known lonely hearts ad in a manchester newspaper - and was immediately sent to a madhouse .
the first person to place a partner ad on the internet remains anonymous , so we 'll never know if they winded up in a psychiatric unit as well .
since then , the internet has revolutionized dating .
instead of relying on chance , millions of lonely hearts these days are taking the matter into their own hands and proactively looking for a suitable partner online .
something for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for company ?
in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .
they met for a second date shortly after their cocktail bar rendezvous and moved in together just a few weeks later .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .
miss world is over and miss germany … is also in demand , " westerwelle said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

a group of underground explorers wants to go down and find out . considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " teufelsberg , " or " devil 's mountain . "
" we know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " dietmar arnold , co-founder of the berlin underground society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with german news agency dpa . arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground berlin has to offer . "
rubble mountain when world war two came to an end in 1945 , the devastated german capital began to clean up and rebuild .
berliners had to do something with the millions of tons of rubble their city had become , so they piled it up just outside the city .
the result was a nearly 120-meter -lrb- 390-foot -rrb- peak , covering up what would have been a key element in adolf hitler 's plan to create the powerful " germania " superpower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans listened to gdr radio communication from teufelsberg during the cold war in the late 1930s , nazi architect albert speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake-side vacation destination near berlin . though construction of the academy began , the nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
it was never completed .
uncovering history during the cold war , the americans set up a radar unit on what had then become teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in east germany .
the buried nazi academy was quickly forgotten - until the berlin underground society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in berlin during the nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them . one of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where hitler took his own life in april 1945 .
although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half-built military academy at the end of the war , arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact - a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for world war two historians . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still , germany lags behind in the e-love trend . helen morrison was a pioneer of modern love : in 1727 she placed the first known lonely hearts ad in a manchester newspaper - and was immediately sent to a madhouse .
the first person to place a partner ad on the internet remains anonymous , so we 'll never know if they winded up in a psychiatric unit as well .
since then , the internet has revolutionized dating .
instead of relying on chance , millions of lonely hearts these days are taking the matter into their own hands and proactively looking for a suitable partner online .
something for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for company ?
in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .
they met for a second date shortly after their cocktail bar rendezvous and moved in together just a few weeks later .
" now i found exactly what i did n't dare to dream of , " said doreen . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.06.2007 german rider admits to doping from notorious spanish doctor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg jaksche is the first rider to break the silence on the subject jörg jaksche of germany has become the first cyclist to confess to doping with the help of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes , the chief suspect in a massive spanish doping probe . jaksche told german news magazine der spiegel , in a report made available saturday ahead of monday 's publication , that he used performance-enhancing drugs since 1997 .
they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "

" it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 30.06.2007 europe turns to liquid natural gas to diversify energy intake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more liquified natural gas facilities are being built around the world with competition for energy resources continuing , some european energy experts who gathered in germany called liquefied natural gas an emerging power source for the future of the eu - for economic and political reasons . as fossil fuel reserves dwindle , european energy suppliers are hoping to increase profits and meet growing energy demands by investing in liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.06.2007 german rider admits to doping from notorious spanish doctor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg jaksche is the first rider to break the silence on the subject jörg jaksche of germany has become the first cyclist to confess to doping with the help of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes , the chief suspect in a massive spanish doping probe . jaksche told german news magazine der spiegel , in a report made available saturday ahead of monday 's publication , that he used performance-enhancing drugs since 1997 .
they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 30.06.2007 europe turns to liquid natural gas to diversify energy intake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more liquified natural gas facilities are being built around the world with competition for energy resources continuing , some european energy experts who gathered in germany called liquefied natural gas an emerging power source for the future of the eu - for economic and political reasons . as fossil fuel reserves dwindle , european energy suppliers are hoping to increase profits and meet growing energy demands by investing in liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .
miss world is over and miss germany … is also in demand , " westerwelle said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 30.06.2007 europe turns to liquid natural gas to diversify energy intake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more liquified natural gas facilities are being built around the world with competition for energy resources continuing , some european energy experts who gathered in germany called liquefied natural gas an emerging power source for the future of the eu - for economic and political reasons . as fossil fuel reserves dwindle , european energy suppliers are hoping to increase profits and meet growing energy demands by investing in liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans listened to gdr radio communication from teufelsberg during the cold war in the late 1930s , nazi architect albert speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake-side vacation destination near berlin . though construction of the academy began , the nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
it was never completed .
uncovering history during the cold war , the americans set up a radar unit on what had then become teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in east germany .
the buried nazi academy was quickly forgotten - until the berlin underground society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in berlin during the nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them . one of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where hitler took his own life in april 1945 .
although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half-built military academy at the end of the war , arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact - a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for world war two historians . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a group of underground explorers wants to go down and find out . considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " teufelsberg , " or " devil 's mountain . "
" we know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " dietmar arnold , co-founder of the berlin underground society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with german news agency dpa . arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground berlin has to offer . "
rubble mountain when world war two came to an end in 1945 , the devastated german capital began to clean up and rebuild .
berliners had to do something with the millions of tons of rubble their city had become , so they piled it up just outside the city .
the result was a nearly 120-meter -lrb- 390-foot -rrb- peak , covering up what would have been a key element in adolf hitler 's plan to create the powerful " germania " superpower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans listened to gdr radio communication from teufelsberg during the cold war in the late 1930s , nazi architect albert speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake-side vacation destination near berlin . though construction of the academy began , the nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
it was never completed .
uncovering history during the cold war , the americans set up a radar unit on what had then become teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in east germany .
the buried nazi academy was quickly forgotten - until the berlin underground society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in berlin during the nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them . one of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where hitler took his own life in april 1945 .
although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half-built military academy at the end of the war , arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact - a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for world war two historians . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still , germany lags behind in the e-love trend . helen morrison was a pioneer of modern love : in 1727 she placed the first known lonely hearts ad in a manchester newspaper - and was immediately sent to a madhouse .
the first person to place a partner ad on the internet remains anonymous , so we 'll never know if they winded up in a psychiatric unit as well .
since then , the internet has revolutionized dating .
instead of relying on chance , millions of lonely hearts these days are taking the matter into their own hands and proactively looking for a suitable partner online .
something for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for company ?
in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .

it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .

still , germany lags behind in the e-love trend . helen morrison was a pioneer of modern love : in 1727 she placed the first known lonely hearts ad in a manchester newspaper - and was immediately sent to a madhouse .
the first person to place a partner ad on the internet remains anonymous , so we 'll never know if they winded up in a psychiatric unit as well .
since then , the internet has revolutionized dating .
instead of relying on chance , millions of lonely hearts these days are taking the matter into their own hands and proactively looking for a suitable partner online .
something for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for company ?
in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .

since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .

finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .

people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .
miss world is over and miss germany … is also in demand , " westerwelle said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.

about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .

finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 30.06.2007 europe turns to liquid natural gas to diversify energy intake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more liquified natural gas facilities are being built around the world with competition for energy resources continuing , some european energy experts who gathered in germany called liquefied natural gas an emerging power source for the future of the eu - for economic and political reasons . as fossil fuel reserves dwindle , european energy suppliers are hoping to increase profits and meet growing energy demands by investing in liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .

people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 30.06.2007 " we 're falling behind in our commitment to afghanistan " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deployment in afghanistan may be further extended later this year in an interview with dw-tv , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke about the need to step up efforts to rebuild afghanistan , settle the future of kosovo and heal tensions with poland . mr steinmeier , the german parliament will be asked to extend the mandate for the afghanistan mission in autumn .
there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .
miss world is over and miss germany … is also in demand , " westerwelle said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .
miss world is over and miss germany … is also in demand , " westerwelle said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .
miss world is over and miss germany … is also in demand , " westerwelle said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 30.06.2007 europe turns to liquid natural gas to diversify energy intake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more liquified natural gas facilities are being built around the world with competition for energy resources continuing , some european energy experts who gathered in germany called liquefied natural gas an emerging power source for the future of the eu - for economic and political reasons . as fossil fuel reserves dwindle , european energy suppliers are hoping to increase profits and meet growing energy demands by investing in liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .
they met for a second date shortly after their cocktail bar rendezvous and moved in together just a few weeks later .
" now i found exactly what i did n't dare to dream of , " said doreen . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.06.2007 german rider admits to doping from notorious spanish doctor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg jaksche is the first rider to break the silence on the subject jörg jaksche of germany has become the first cyclist to confess to doping with the help of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes , the chief suspect in a massive spanish doping probe . jaksche told german news magazine der spiegel , in a report made available saturday ahead of monday 's publication , that he used performance-enhancing drugs since 1997 .
they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .
they met for a second date shortly after their cocktail bar rendezvous and moved in together just a few weeks later .
" now i found exactly what i did n't dare to dream of , " said doreen . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

still , germany lags behind in the e-love trend . helen morrison was a pioneer of modern love : in 1727 she placed the first known lonely hearts ad in a manchester newspaper - and was immediately sent to a madhouse .
the first person to place a partner ad on the internet remains anonymous , so we 'll never know if they winded up in a psychiatric unit as well .
since then , the internet has revolutionized dating .
instead of relying on chance , millions of lonely hearts these days are taking the matter into their own hands and proactively looking for a suitable partner online .
something for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for company ?
in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .
they met for a second date shortly after their cocktail bar rendezvous and moved in together just a few weeks later .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .

the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .

a group of underground explorers wants to go down and find out . considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " teufelsberg , " or " devil 's mountain . "
" we know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " dietmar arnold , co-founder of the berlin underground society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with german news agency dpa . arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground berlin has to offer .

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

there are rumors in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- that you might not get the majority you need .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in my judgment there are no rumors .
there is a discussion about it and that is necessary .
in contrast to many other countries that are engaged in afghanistan , the continuation of our involvement there requires not only the support of the german public but also of the german parliament .
we have to win that support , and i am confident that in the autumn , we will reach the necessary decisions .
many of your social democrat colleagues criticize the us-led operation " enduring freedom " because many civilians are being killed .
would n't it be better for germany to withdraw from this part of the mission ?
there 's no question about it - such mandates need to be discussed .
and in autumn , we shall have to look closely and critically at which parts of the mandate we wish to extend , and , if necessary , change .
but it 's more important to consider how we are doing with regard to our own commitments to the afghan people .
you have to occasionally remind people that we are not alone in afghanistan .
after the terrible attacks in 2001 -lrb- in new york and washington -rrb- we , together with others , took over the responsibility of dismantling these training grounds for worldwide terrorism .
we committed ourselves to do the necessary along with other partners .
along with others , we took a common pledge to ease civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
the country and its people have been plagued by war and civil strife for 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are scarred by decades of war i 've come to the conclusion that we 're falling behind with civilian reconstruction in afghanistan .
and more importantly , in light of our mandate that needs extending , we 're lagging in our commitment to help afghan security officials , the police and the army , take responsibility of their own nation .
in other words : we 're not doing enough to keep our own commitments to afghanistan and that 's why i think we need to strengthen our efforts here .
we have to ensure that our military presence in afghanistan is not perceived as a form of occupation .
and in all our activities , we have to take the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties .
my impression is that the german bundeswehr soldiers and many others are doing everything they can in that regard .
and i know from my own visits to afghanistan that the afghan people largely accept the presence of the bundeswehr .
the citizens there realize that a military presence is necessary to enable civilian reconstruction , for example by private aid organizations .
there is another side to the discussion .
some here in berlin - and also soldiers in afghanistan - say the separation of isaf and enduring freedom is artificial ... that the two missions should be brought together under a single command .
would that make sense ?
i think it made sense to leave the anti-terrorism tasks , the pursuit of terrorists , in the hands of operation enduring freedom . and the provision of security for the tasks i have just described - protection to allow reconstruction to take place - in the hands of isaf .
i think this division is sensible but it 's something we will be discussing this year , not just here in germany , but also with our european and nato partners .
the highest-ranking german general in afghanistan says more troops are needed to stop the taliban winning this battle .
what do you think about such concerns ?
could the west fail in afghanistan ?
you can never rule out failure with military missions anywhere in the world .
and so of course there is the risk in afghanistan that we might not be able to achieve our aims , in particular , as quickly as we would like to see .
but contrary to some of the reports in recent days , one really should not overlook the fact that even in the south of the country where the security situation is still very precarious as compared with other parts , there has been a significant improvement in recent months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , with pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz but i will say one thing and it 's something that i have attached clear importance to this year : we will not solve the problem in the south unless we can manage to bring afghanistan and pakistan together in a proper political dialogue .
we need to get both sides talking about how to provide better protection along the long and difficult border between pakistan and afghanistan .
as part of our presidency of the g8 , we held talks with foreign ministers of both pakistan and afghanistan here in germany and i hope we were successful in kick starting a dialogue between them ... so that questions such as this can be dealt with through mutual , co-operative political responsibility .
afghanistan and other conflict zones were on the agenda during the g8 presidency and at the recent summit in heiligendamm .
but there does n't seem to have been a breakthrough in mapping out a clearer future for kosovo .
why not ?
i have to admit that we are still some way away from a solution for the final status of kosovo and from a consensus among the un security council members .
but i have a degree of hope when i look ahead to the talks between president putin and president bush in early july .
i hope this matter will be discussed , and i hope the basis of this discussion will be the joint recognition that the final status issue for kosovo can not be postponed much longer .
otherwise , impatience over the issue will boil over and above all in kosovo , the situation will become difficult to control .
it 's been an exciting and challenging few weeks and months , with the g8 presidency and eu presidency .
how satisfied are you with what germany was able to achieve in this dual role ?
my impression is that our european partners recognize that this was a very successful presidency overall .
we tackled some very important issues and i hope we brought them to a successful conclusion .
in my view , these include decisions on climate protection and energy policy that i think were not just courageous , but also ground-breaking .
without those decisions , i do n't believe the discussions at the g8 summit in heiligendamm would have been possible .
and i am also very satisfied with what we achieved in the last few days of our presidency of the european union .
the foundation that was agreed on is no longer called a " constitution " but i think we managed to achieve what we always said was our aim : namely , to preserve the substance of the draft constitution .
i think that the form of the treaty that was agreed will be the basis for the future co-operation of the member states .
poland made things very difficult for the eu presidency .
warsaw struck a strong anti-german note during the summit .
how much has that damaged relations with poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski , left , with german chancellor angela merkel of course , the memory of these unpleasant rows , covered by the media , lingers .
but despite everything i will not lose sight of the fact that the support of the polish people for europe was considerable and has grown even further since the agreement reached last weekend .
and that tells me that the people of poland want a good , neighborly relationship with germany and that they also want to feel a part of europe for the future .
after these rows , it 's very important to remember that this is our joint future .
for both germany and poland , the future lies in europe .
i intend to work on that , and i am confident that we have partners willing to cooperate to this end in poland .

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .
under a new guideline by the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , riders are asked to sign an anti-doping declaration under which they agree to pay a year 's salary on top of a ban if they are caught doping . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .

they included the blood doping substance epo , human growth hormone and other forbidden substances throughout his career at various teams , mostly with the knowledge of team leaders .
the german , who lives in austria , was suspended by his team - tinkoff credit systems - for suspected involvement in " operation puerto . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a triumphant jaksche in france 2004 " i believe it 's important for the future of the sport that someone comes out and says , ' ok , this is how it happens here ' , " jaksche told der spiegel .
" it is perverse but the doping system is just because everyone dopes .
cycling without doping is only just if no one dopes , " he said .
" i am bella " jaksche 's biggest career wins came in 2004 , the classic paris-nice event and the mediterranean tour .
he planned to compete at this week 's german championships but was barred by the national cycling body .
the 30-year-old said that he received forbidden blood transfusions with the help of eufemiano fuentes from 2005 onwards .
the scandal broke in may 2006 when spanish authorities seized about 100 bags of frozen blood in the madrid offices of fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan basso of italy , left , followed by lance armstrong " i am ' bella ' .
it was my blood that was found in three bags .
i am also the ' number 20 ' from the documents and i was a client of doctor fuentes in madrid 2005 and 2006 , ' jaksche said .
more than 50 riders have been implicated in the affair .
up to now italian ivan basso was the only rider to confess , but said he only intended to dope with the help of fuentes .
jaksche suggested he was surprised that not more riders were on the list .
spanish doc not a butcher says jaksche jaksche said he was contacted by fuentes after joining the now defunct liberty seguros team run by manolo saiz , another key suspect in the spanish probe named operation puerto .
jaksche said that he met fuentes for the first time in january 2005 and talked with the doctor about the full spectrum of doping ranging from steroids and artificial hemoglobin to epo and finally to blood transfusions .
" fuentes effectively outlined his entire catalogue and asked what risk i was prepared to take .
he meant the risk of being caught , not the health risk .
that 's how we got to doping with your own blood , " jaksche said .
" the method was completely new for me , but he talked about it like others talk about changing nappies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's jan ullrich announced his retirement earlier this year amid a probe of his role in the spanish doping scandal jaksche said that fuentes never mentioned other riders to him , calling him " a master of disguise , " and that careful health precautions were taken when the transfusions were carried out .
he said that fuentes had assistants such as a german doctor under investigation by göttingen prosecutors .
" fuentes is one of those sports physicians who are happy when their riders have top results because they see it as a triumph for themselves as well . "
" he is not a spanish butcher .
there is something brilliant about him , even though he sometimes is a little crazy .
he is the kind of guy who drives through a red light just to see what happens , " he said .
a " crash course " in doping like basso , jaksche did not implicate other riders , but he gave a detailed testimony in the 13-page interview and report by der spiegel .
jaksche said that he first used epo in 1997 while at the polti team and that he also doped while at team telekom , once , csc and liberty seguros .
he said he got a " crash course " in doping at polti from team boss gianluigi stanga , now the head of the milram team , in june 1997 .
" it was my crash course .
a team assistant gave me a shot of epo in my room , " jaksche said .
" i did what i had to do to be better in my job .
the logic behind it is that you adjust your performance level to that of the others because everyone is doing it -lrb- doping -rrb- .
you live in a parallel world in cycling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter godefroot , former sport director of telekom cycling team from 1992 to 2005 the 30-year-old said that team leaders such as telekom 's walter godefroot and csc 's bjarne riis were aware of the forbidden practices even though the words doping or epo were not mentioned at team meetings .
" the team leadership knew everything .
it was a fully installed system , " he said about his telekom days .
former telekom riders such as the 1996 tour winner riis , eric zabel and rolf aldag have admitted to using epo doping in the 1990s .
according to der spiegel , all parties accused by jaksche have dismissed the allegations .
jaksche ready to be chief witness jaksche 's lawyer , micheal lehner , said friday that jaksche was ready to act as a chief witness for the world anti-doping agency , the uci and the authorities .
if he did he could escape with a lesser doping ban than the mandatory two years .
jaksche 's revelations came one week before the start of the 2007 tour de france in london .
tour organizers have said that all riders implicated in the fuentes case are not welcome , and others with positive or suspicious doping test results , such as german michael kessler and italians alessandro petacchi and danilo di luca .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .
people will only support the european union if they feel the bloc is aligned with their interests , lafontaine said .
merkel 's critics point out that with the end of the eu presidency that involved six months of travelling and talking constantly about european issues , merkel will now have to get ready to debate internal issues . " domestic politics are calling and she has to do her homework .
miss world is over and miss germany … is also in demand , " westerwelle said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a group of underground explorers wants to go down and find out . considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " teufelsberg , " or " devil 's mountain . "
" we know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " dietmar arnold , co-founder of the berlin underground society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with german news agency dpa . arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground berlin has to offer . "
rubble mountain when world war two came to an end in 1945 , the devastated german capital began to clean up and rebuild .
berliners had to do something with the millions of tons of rubble their city had become , so they piled it up just outside the city .
the result was a nearly 120-meter -lrb- 390-foot -rrb- peak , covering up what would have been a key element in adolf hitler 's plan to create the powerful " germania " superpower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans listened to gdr radio communication from teufelsberg during the cold war in the late 1930s , nazi architect albert speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake-side vacation destination near berlin . though construction of the academy began , the nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
it was never completed .
uncovering history during the cold war , the americans set up a radar unit on what had then become teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in east germany .
the buried nazi academy was quickly forgotten - until the berlin underground society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in berlin during the nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them . one of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where hitler took his own life in april 1945 .
although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half-built military academy at the end of the war , arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact - a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for world war two historians . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .

still , germany lags behind in the e-love trend . helen morrison was a pioneer of modern love : in 1727 she placed the first known lonely hearts ad in a manchester newspaper - and was immediately sent to a madhouse .
the first person to place a partner ad on the internet remains anonymous , so we 'll never know if they winded up in a psychiatric unit as well .
since then , the internet has revolutionized dating .
instead of relying on chance , millions of lonely hearts these days are taking the matter into their own hands and proactively looking for a suitable partner online .
something for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for company ?
in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .
they met for a second date shortly after their cocktail bar rendezvous and moved in together just a few weeks later .
" now i found exactly what i did n't dare to dream of , " said doreen . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .

a group of underground explorers wants to go down and find out . considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " teufelsberg , " or " devil 's mountain . "
" we know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " dietmar arnold , co-founder of the berlin underground society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with german news agency dpa . arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground berlin has to offer . "
rubble mountain when world war two came to an end in 1945 , the devastated german capital began to clean up and rebuild .
berliners had to do something with the millions of tons of rubble their city had become , so they piled it up just outside the city .
the result was a nearly 120-meter -lrb- 390-foot -rrb- peak , covering up what would have been a key element in adolf hitler 's plan to create the powerful " germania " superpower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans listened to gdr radio communication from teufelsberg during the cold war in the late 1930s , nazi architect albert speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake-side vacation destination near berlin . though construction of the academy began , the nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
it was never completed .
uncovering history during the cold war , the americans set up a radar unit on what had then become teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in east germany .
the buried nazi academy was quickly forgotten - until the berlin underground society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in berlin during the nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them . one of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where hitler took his own life in april 1945 .
although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half-built military academy at the end of the war , arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact - a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for world war two historians . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first person to place a partner ad on the internet remains anonymous , so we 'll never know if they winded up in a psychiatric unit as well .
since then , the internet has revolutionized dating .
instead of relying on chance , millions of lonely hearts these days are taking the matter into their own hands and proactively looking for a suitable partner online .
something for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for company ?
in the german-speaking areas alone there are hundreds of online dating services .
many of them cater to their users ' special needs : there are websites for truck drivers , hippies , wine experts , dog lovers , vegetarians , heavy metal fans , and the hard of hearing .
since digital dating became a global phenomenon , the number of couples that have found their happiness online is in the millions .
the dating service shaadi.com , incorporating roughly 50 million users , is one of the top 10 web sites in india .
hundreds and thousands of marriages have already been initiated this way , and thousands of couples express their gratitude on the site .
match.com claims to be the largest dating service worldwide - and one of the oldest ones , too .
they 've been online since 1995 .
" for the internet era , that 's even before stone age , " says brigitta schall from match.com.
germans reluctant to look online since 2003 the site is available in german , too .
more than 15 million users have sought a partner here - from every age group and every part of the world .
about one tenth come from german-speaking regions , but in schall 's opinion that 's not enough .
she says it 's a problem of mentality . " online dating does n't have the same acceptance as in england or the us , " she said , adding that germans are reluctant to admit they are looking for their partners online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans und doreen are one success story doreen and hans do n't belong to this group - at least not any more .
after failed relationships , the two berliners signed up on the singles page at the beginning of the year without expecting to find the love of their life .
" it was just for fun , " said doreen .
" my mother used to look for a partner through singles ads in newspaper , " doreen said . " i smiled at that and always thought , that 's not going work anyway . "
but that was before the internet .
finally face to face connecting on the world wide web is just the first step in starting a relationship , of course , and most do n't stay digital for long .
according to a survey by the university of bath , 80 percent of couples who met at a dating platform had their first real date within one month after their first online encounter .
hans and doreen took that step after just a couple of e-mails .
they chose a local cocktail bar as the location for their first date .
it was n't exactly a " blind date , " though , because they already knew what the other looked like .
" this is one of the biggest advantages , " said hans .
" if the other one is reasonably honest , you avoid nasty surprises . "
hans and doreen 's online honesty paid off .

a group of underground explorers wants to go down and find out . considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " teufelsberg , " or " devil 's mountain . "
" we know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " dietmar arnold , co-founder of the berlin underground society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with german news agency dpa . arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground berlin has to offer . "
rubble mountain when world war two came to an end in 1945 , the devastated german capital began to clean up and rebuild .
berliners had to do something with the millions of tons of rubble their city had become , so they piled it up just outside the city .
the result was a nearly 120-meter -lrb- 390-foot -rrb- peak , covering up what would have been a key element in adolf hitler 's plan to create the powerful " germania " superpower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans listened to gdr radio communication from teufelsberg during the cold war in the late 1930s , nazi architect albert speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake-side vacation destination near berlin . though construction of the academy began , the nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
it was never completed .
uncovering history during the cold war , the americans set up a radar unit on what had then become teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in east germany .
the buried nazi academy was quickly forgotten - until the berlin underground society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in berlin during the nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them . one of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where hitler took his own life in april 1945 .
although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half-built military academy at the end of the war , arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact - a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for world war two historians . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 30.06.2007 merkel 's domestic critics not too impressed by eu treaty deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's critics say it 's time to tackle issues at home germany 's six-month eu presidency comes to an end this weekend .
not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .
people are interested in issues such as taxes and salaries , said oskar lafontaine , chair of the left party .

" european energy supply companies have their backs to the wall , " said florian haslauer , a consultant at a.t. kearney , adding that he expected demand for lng to triple by 2020 .
" they have to create access to lng gas as fast as they can . "
the european union currently imports 28 percent of its gas from russia and a further 12 percent from algeria .
lng makes up just 7 percent of gas imported into the bloc , though many expect that to increase as energy companies invest in lng infrastructure .
the june study produced by a.t. kearney said european energy supply companies would have to spend about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- on lng infrastructure over the next 13 years to meet energy needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar has the world 's third largest natural gas reserves germany 's eon ruhrgas announced earlier this month that it would expand its lng operations with a 24.5 percent stake in a new lng terminal expected to cost between 500 million to 600 million euros to be built in le havre by 2011 .
the company is also planning to invest an additional 500 million euros in a terminal in germany 's wilhelmshaven , which is slated to open in 2011 .
" lng is an important factor for europe 's future energy supply security , " jochen weise , a member of the eon executive board said in a statement .
" in an increasingly global gas market it will offer us good chances for additional growth . "
ease of transport currently used mainly to generate heat and electricity , lng is created when natural gas is cooled to minus 160 degrees c. at that temperature the gas shrinks to a 600th of volume , making it possible to load onto tankers for long-distance trips .
norway 's statoil , which is owned mainly by the norwegian government , is hoping to achieve status as a key exporter of lng .
in may , it opened europe 's first lng export terminal on the island of melkoya .
the island , which before being set up to export the liquefied gas was nearly uninhabited , has been loading lng onto boats destined for spain and the united states since may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abilitiy to ship lng long distances means the gas can be sold in more markets shipping the liquefied gas is more cost efficient than pipelines when the lng travels over 3,000 km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , according to a february 2006 analysis by the hypo-vereinsbank .
diversifying eu gas imports though transporting gas in a fashion similar to oil could be a first step to creating a world market for the energy source , which has been limited to regional sales until now due to the high costs of creating pipelines , it would not necessarily lead to diversification of eu energy supplies , according to a study by andreas goldthau of the german institute for international and security affairs .
he pointed out that even by importing lng , europe would neither necessarily diversify its energy sources as russia has the world 's largest gas reserves , followed by iran , qatar , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
however even if russian energy imports continued , a combination of market liberalizations and lng imports would reduce moscow 's strategic importance as an energy producer , according to the german institute for economic research in berlin .
that would already be a step in the right direction , according to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs who said that while he remained confident russia would fulfill its energy contracts , the eu could use lng to cushion the blow of " unpredictable developments " in the gas market . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "

guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .

not impressed by the treaty deal , chancellor merkel 's domestic critics say she needs to focus more attention on issues at home . as german chancellor angela merkel gets ready to hand over her country 's six-month rotating eu presidency to portugal this weekend , she can look back on a successful stint on the european stage that has earned her international praise .
during the past six months merkel has tackled major issues .
the german leader helped hammer out a climate deal in march , organized the bloc 's 50th anniversary party this spring and last week squeezed out an agreement on a landmark treaty that will pave the future path for the 27-nation bloc .
merkel , in her last address to the european parliament , said the treaty will provide a foundation for a common future .
" at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . "
priorities criticized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating between different interests is n't always easy for the most part , merkel 's political opponents in germany felt she handled negotiations well .
guido westerwelle from the opposition free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , felt the successful eu presidency underscored german diplomacy . " it was not only in the interest of the parliamentary groups that germany 's eu presidency would be successful , but also in a national interest , " westerwelle said .
but not everyone in the opposition ranks is pleased with merkel 's eu treaty deal . gergor gysi , head of the left party , a new left-wing alliance , said he was extremely disappointed the treaty did n't do more to address the issue of basic human rights .
it 's tragic that " each country can decide whether to adopt these basic rights or not and whether they 're binding .
this is naturally not an improvement , " gysi said .
the green party had also hoped for more .
green leader renate künast felt merkel did n't do much to advance social causes .
" the only social issue point on the agenda , namely eu pensions , was not advanced by merkel .
that would have been a sign … that this eu is concerned for the daily social problems of people .
this is a failing , " künast said .
" miss world is over " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , center , in the hot seat for the left party , the german presidency 's top issues were too far removed from the daily lives of eu residents .

a group of underground explorers wants to go down and find out . considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " teufelsberg , " or " devil 's mountain . "
" we know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " dietmar arnold , co-founder of the berlin underground society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with german news agency dpa . arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground berlin has to offer . "
rubble mountain when world war two came to an end in 1945 , the devastated german capital began to clean up and rebuild .
berliners had to do something with the millions of tons of rubble their city had become , so they piled it up just outside the city .
the result was a nearly 120-meter -lrb- 390-foot -rrb- peak , covering up what would have been a key element in adolf hitler 's plan to create the powerful " germania " superpower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans listened to gdr radio communication from teufelsberg during the cold war in the late 1930s , nazi architect albert speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake-side vacation destination near berlin . though construction of the academy began , the nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
it was never completed .
uncovering history during the cold war , the americans set up a radar unit on what had then become teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in east germany .
the buried nazi academy was quickly forgotten - until the berlin underground society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in berlin during the nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them . one of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where hitler took his own life in april 1945 .
although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half-built military academy at the end of the war , arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact - a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for world war two historians . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a group of underground explorers wants to go down and find out . considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " teufelsberg , " or " devil 's mountain . "
" we know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " dietmar arnold , co-founder of the berlin underground society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with german news agency dpa . arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground berlin has to offer . "
rubble mountain when world war two came to an end in 1945 , the devastated german capital began to clean up and rebuild .
berliners had to do something with the millions of tons of rubble their city had become , so they piled it up just outside the city .
the result was a nearly 120-meter -lrb- 390-foot -rrb- peak , covering up what would have been a key element in adolf hitler 's plan to create the powerful " germania " superpower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans listened to gdr radio communication from teufelsberg during the cold war in the late 1930s , nazi architect albert speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake-side vacation destination near berlin . though construction of the academy began , the nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
it was never completed .
uncovering history during the cold war , the americans set up a radar unit on what had then become teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in east germany .
the buried nazi academy was quickly forgotten - until the berlin underground society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in berlin during the nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them . one of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where hitler took his own life in april 1945 .
although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half-built military academy at the end of the war , arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact - a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for world war two historians . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

plymouth city council wants to move out of the 14-storey civic centre which it says is " long past its sell-by date " .
the government awarded the status after a request by " more than one person " and advice from english heritage .
gary streeter , alison seabeck and linda gilroy are launching a petition for the decision to be reversed .
english heritage says the civic centre , opened by the queen in 1962 , is a " very important post war building and is an iconic feature in the centre of plymouth " .
it recommended the listing on the basis that it was a complete set of civic buildings and had an " unusual richness of art work " and " very fine internal decoration " .
the council opposed the listing when they heard it was being considered several months ago .
a grade ii listing recognises a site 's special interest and warrants every effort to preserve it .

planet earth will be given free with a future edition of the mail on sunday .
the 10-track cd from prince - whose hits include purple rain , sign o ' the times and cream - is not due to be released until 24 july .
paul quirk , co-chairman of the entertainment retailers association , said the decision " beggars belief " .
" the artist formerly known as prince should know that with behaviour like this he will soon be the artist formerly available in record stores , " said mr quirk , referring to a period in the 1990s when prince famously stopped using his name in favour of a symbol . "
no one has done this before ... this is just setting a new level " stephen miron , mail on sunday md " it is an insult to all those record stores who have supported prince throughout his career .
" it is yet another example of the damaging covermount culture which is destroying any perception of value around recorded music . "
the practice of " covermounts " - where newspapers attempt to lure readers with dvds and cds - is used widely in the industry .
the mail on sunday 's recent cd giveaways include peter gabriel , dolly parton , duran duran , ub40 and mike oldfield 's tubular bells .
stephen miron , the newspaper 's managing director , said : " no one has done this before .
we have always given away cds and dvds , but this is just setting a new level . "
out of business mr miron declined to say how much the newspaper had paid to secure the deal .
he added that the newspaper was not out to put music retailers out of business .
" they are living in the old days and have n't developed their businesses sufficiently .
we can enhance their business .
they are being incredibly insular and need to move their business on , " he said .
but hmv chief executive simon fox has said it would be " absolutely nuts " to give the album away for free .
the company revealed on thursday that its profits had more than halved in the face of cut-price competition from supermarkets and online retailers .
the deal has also led to the uk arm of sony bmg pulling out of the distribution agreement .

the 10-track cd from prince - whose hits include purple rain , sign o ' the times and cream - is not due to be released until 24 july .
paul quirk , co-chairman of the entertainment retailers association , said the decision " beggars belief " .
" the artist formerly known as prince should know that with behaviour like this he will soon be the artist formerly available in record stores , " said mr quirk , referring to a period in the 1990s when prince famously stopped using his name in favour of a symbol .
no one has done this before ... this is just setting a new level stephen miron , mail on sunday md " it is an insult to all those record stores who have supported prince throughout his career .
" it is yet another example of the damaging covermount culture which is destroying any perception of value around recorded music . "
the practice of " covermounts " - where newspapers attempt to lure readers with dvds and cds - is used widely in the industry .
the mail on sunday 's recent cd giveaways include peter gabriel , dolly parton , duran duran , ub40 and mike oldfield 's tubular bells .
stephen miron , the newspaper 's managing director , said : " no one has done this before .
we have always given away cds and dvds , but this is just setting a new level . "
out of business mr miron declined to say how much the newspaper had paid to secure the deal .
he added that the newspaper was not out to put music retailers out of business .
" they are living in the old days and have n't developed their businesses sufficiently .
we can enhance their business .
they are being incredibly insular and need to move their business on , " he said .
but hmv chief executive simon fox has said it would be " absolutely nuts " to give the album away for free .
the company revealed on thursday that its profits had more than halved in the face of cut-price competition from supermarkets and online retailers .
the deal has also led to the uk arm of sony bmg pulling out of the distribution agreement .
" given the sheer number of copies we are talking about here it seemed the right thing to do for retailers to become exempt from the deal in the uk , " said a spokesman for sony bmg , the world 's second-biggest music company .
prince is due to play 21 concert dates in london later this year .

people living and working near the scene of the first discovery have described the scene .
officers carried out a controlled explosion after reports of a suspicious vehicle parked in haymarket shortly before 0200 bst .
the area was cordoned off as forensic experts examined what they described as a " potentially viable explosive device " .
the night-clubber rajeshree patel was in the tiger tiger club when the alert began .
she told the bbc clubbers were ushered away from the front door when trying to leave the building .
" we actually thought we would use another exit , thinking there was some kind of skirmish .
then we found the backdoor was also blocked and we were n't able to actually leave .
" we were then slowly ushered out through the back entrance through another floor - because there are four floors - and it was only when we went out onto the street and tried to make our way to the front of the building that we realised it was all cordoned off . "
the local residents local resident angela coster , who lives in haymarket , said she found out about the bomb from television news .
" we 're in a residential block in haymarket - it seems strange that there 's 18 flats in the block and not one person was woken up .
it 's kind of off-putting in a way , " she said . "
the best way to describe it , like my wife said , is it 's like the movie 28 days later " alexander aragon ms coster said a police officer could not tell her whether she would be able to return home after work .
" he had no idea whether we 'd be able to get back in or not ... if the blue tarp is still there i do n't think i 'll feel very safe , " she said .
alexander aragon , who lives 100m from tiger tiger nightclub , where the suspicious car was found , decided to stay home after police told him that if he left his building he may not be allowed to return .
" everything 's dead quiet , " he told the bbc news website .
" the best way to describe it , like my wife said , is it 's like the movie 28 days later . "
he said police were patrolling the area , but by midday they had removed one of the cordons near his block .
alan bassett said that police had surrounded every exit to his apartment building as he left for work in the morning .
" no-one attempted to evacuate us out of the flat as far as i 'm aware .
they 're very anxious not to let me go back into my flat now , " he said .
" if i had n't put the bbc on this morning i 'd have had no idea what was going on at all . "
the workers another eye-witness sonja bakkes said that most people in the area seemed " very blasé " about the situation .
" people are just having a look and obviously wanting to know how they can get to where they 're going but everyone 's very calm .
no one 's overly excited .
" everyone 's going to work as usual ...
i do n't think people really know what 's going on . "
robert hoadley , who manages many of the landmark buildings in the area - including the trocadero , london pavilion and lillywhites - told the bbc the bomb was found at a busy time of day in that part of town .
" this time of the morning you 've got a lot of bus routes going down past there , i think the number 38 bus - one of the main bus routes into victoria goes past there - so that 's certainly where i saw the barriers up and the screens up from the back of the police cordon at the lillywhites end of jermyn street , " he said .
the tourist yoo na lee , a tourist from korea , was at the site with her boyfriend and was taking pictures of what she believed was a movie set .
" we thought a hollywood star was here and it was a movie scene , " she said .
" we did not know it was the news . "
