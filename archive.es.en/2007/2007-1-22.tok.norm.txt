german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?
chancellor angela merkel made an appeal this week for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy and questioned germany 's phase-out plans .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .
however , he , for one , has got used to it .
his sister hülya agrees with him and credits the professional film team with putting the family at ease .

and when she was approached to portray a turkish family in the role , she was inspired immediately . " i still have the feeling that this is a very amusing world which we have not seen in its entirety yet , " says diehl .
" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .

" kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

it can be a very stressful business .
but a german man threw caution to the wind and took his wife out for a quiet lesson .
or that 's what he thought . when learning to drive , it 's often safest for all those involved to take those first tentative steps towards auto proficiency on a quiet little stretch of road .
there , the inexperienced driver can toddle along at a snail 's pace without infuriating the other road users or putting anyone 's life at risk . this was surely the intention of the caring husband who decided to ease his young bride into the driver 's seat with a leisurely lesson on a deserted stretch of asphalt . unfortunately , while hubby obviously had his beloved 's best interests at heart , he had n't thought the whole thing through .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . some people deny that jesus is the lord .

making it a crime to have a different opinion is awful .

not to mention that it will put us , the jews , into a " special " category again , which is very undesirable .

the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . " we have won as we had expected , " nikolic , the radicals ' candidate for prime minister , told afp .
pro-eu forces control majority but serbian president boris tadic said the polls were a breakthrough for pro-european union forces , which he urged to form a coalition government as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic would like to see his democratic party lead the new government " all parties supporting a pro-european stance won a majority and this is an important signal that serbia will send to europe and the world , " said tadic , the leader of the ds . tadic 's democrats are now being tipped to form a government with moderate nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and g17 plus . the three main groupings were followed by the reformist g17 plus party with 6.8 percent , milosevic 's socialist party of serbia with 5.9 percent and a neo-liberal alliance led by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- with 5.3 percent . " it 's necessary to form the government as soon as possible in order to start solving all problems that are awaiting us , " said tadic . nikolic , an outspoken critic of the un administration in kosovo , the european union and international war crimes trials against serbs , said he was " not convinced that we -lrb- the radicals -rrb- will be able to form the government . " he earlier ruled out forming a government with major opponents and warned moderate parties would " surrender " serbia 's sovereignty over kosovo .
kosovo remains critical issue sunday 's election came with serbia on the brink of losing kosovo , its historic heartland which has been run by the united nations since the end of the 1998-1999 war between serb forces and ethnic albanian guerrillas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic says the radical party would not " surrender " kosovo un envoy martti ahtisaari is expected to propose a form of independence for kosovo next week , which the international community hopes will resolve the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s . ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , are seeking independence , a demand staunchly opposed by serbia which is willing to consider only a form of broad autonomy . the un envoy delayed his long-awaited proposal until after the polls so as not to inflame nationalist sentiment in serbia at election time . asked by reporters whether he would accept kosovo 's independence , tadic said : " loud and clear , the answer is no . " and kostunica , a fervent opponent of kosovo 's independence , is expected to fight to hold on to his position , possibly in a bid to delay the formation of a coalition government and impact on the kosovo process .
result to be confirmed thursday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica , left , needs coalition partners to stay in power but he said his party was ready for talks on a new cabinet " as soon as final results are known , " alluding to a jan .
25 deadline for the electoral commission to confirm the vote outcome . " what 's more important is to have a consensus in the parliament ... especially when future status of kosovo is in question , " said kostunica . kosovo was a central theme of election campaigning ahead of a united nations decision next week on the future status of the breakaway province which has been run by a un mission since its 1998-1999 war . serbians voted for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups .
kosovo albanians are excluded from rolls , having boycotted serbian elections since the early 1990s . some 500 international and 5,000 local observers monitored the vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbian polls to decide if country 's future will be european serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?
chancellor angela merkel made an appeal this week for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy and questioned germany 's phase-out plans .

the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .

while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced .

as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .

the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .

" this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally .

" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed .

at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . as part of the red army faction raf " second generation " - after the founders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicides in jail in 1976 and 1977 , mohnhaupt led a 1977 raf kidnapping in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , was seized from his car , and found dead 44 days later . she was arrested in 1982 . a humane gesture " an act of clemency would be a humane gesture , " said green party politician volker beck .
" it would be a signal of reconciliation , which is appropriate after more than 20 years in prison . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims .

" do not set my husband 's killer free , " waltrude schleyer told the daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
" i will never be able to forgive brigitte mohnhaupt .

" calm and self-confident prison officials say mohnhaupt has been well-behaved in the prison in bavaria and no longer poses threat to society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf officially ceased to exist in 1998 " i am certain that she will never commit another crime again , " prison warden wolfgang deuschl told the web site of the german weekly stern .
" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

" the chancellor has a very close relationship with the foreign minister , which is based on trust , " said government spokesman thomas steg at a monday press conference .
" -lrb- she -rrb- goes on the assumption that the two will continue their successful work together . " steinmeier is being asked to explain his role in the prolonged detention of murat kurnaz in the us military prison in cuba .
kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years in there after his arrest as a suspected al qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the sept.11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . secret government documents circulating in the german media claim the us offered to release him in 2002 after concluding that he was not a terrorist , but that germany refused to take him back . the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung claimed steinmeier was actively involved in his role as coordinator of the country 's intelligence services under the then government of chancellor gerhard schröder . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 on the intervention of the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . committee investigation last week he appeared before a parliamentary panel investigating whether the country 's foreign intelligence service bnd breached german regulations while assisting us anti-terrorism operations after sept.11. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was questioned in front of the investigative committee in december steinmeier is scheduled to appear before the committee after kurnaz gives evidence again on feb .

plötner said , however , that steinmeier was eager for the investigative committee to conclude its questioning of preliminary witnesses so that he would be able to " clear up the matter quickly . " kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday . " i 'm certain that when he addresses the panel he will be able to demonstrate that he acted without reproach , " he said . indignities the bearded kurnaz , 24 , described how he was subjected to physical and psychological abuse by his us captors that included being sprayed with " knock-out " gas and chained up for 12 hours a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz kurnaz 's account of the indignities he suffered during his time in guantanamo " got under my skin , " said max stadler , an opposition free democrat member of the parliamentary committee .
" it makes you really angry to learn that an innocent man was forced to spend five years in such conditions . " kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

plötner said , however , that steinmeier was eager for the investigative committee to conclude its questioning of preliminary witnesses so that he would be able to " clear up the matter quickly . " kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday . " i 'm certain that when he addresses the panel he will be able to demonstrate that he acted without reproach , " he said . indignities the bearded kurnaz , 24 , described how he was subjected to physical and psychological abuse by his us captors that included being sprayed with " knock-out " gas and chained up for 12 hours a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz kurnaz 's account of the indignities he suffered during his time in guantanamo " got under my skin , " said max stadler , an opposition free democrat member of the parliamentary committee .
" it makes you really angry to learn that an innocent man was forced to spend five years in such conditions . " kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

" more than two-thirds of the seats will go to the democratic forces , " steinmeier said on monday in brussels .
" as far as i can tell , this is a good basis for serbia to form a government that will put it on the european path . " the radical party claimed victory in serbian general elections on sunday after estimations put the formation in front , but conceded it had failed to get an outright majority and was unlikely to form a government . based on partial , unofficial results , the radical party had garnered 28.7 percent of votes .
the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . pro-european coalition expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's javier solana wants a reliable partner in serbia " i hope very much that there could be the formation of a government with pro-european and democratic forces , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday . " the majority from the elections is a majority which is for democratic forces , " solana said . as solana spoke , eu ambassadors were meeting to draw up a position on the polls for the ministers to debate over lunch . officials in brussels have said the bloc dearly wanted to see a moderate coalition emerge that is ready to cooperate with the un war crimes court , possibly leading to the unblocking of talks on closer ties . mounting problems but the strength of the serbian radical party - whose president vojislav seselj is awaiting trial at the un court - means it could take a long time to form a coalition , which could raise tensions in kosovo with its ethnic albanian majority increasingly impatient for independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo remains one of the biggest challenges facing the future serbian government " it 's up to the serbs what government they form , but i think their approach should be a european one , " said luxembourg 's foreign minister , jean asselborn . the eu froze a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with belgrade in may chiefly for its failure to surrender to the tribunal former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic , who was believed to be hiding in serbia . the accord is a first step for balkan states to join europe 's rich club , and serbia is desperate to enter the bloc and rebuild its economy " everyone knows what they have to do as far as the saa is concerned , but we will have to see , " asselborn said .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?
chancellor angela merkel made an appeal this week for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy and questioned germany 's phase-out plans .
see what other readers had to say about nuclear energy in germany .
-lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .
-lrb- 16.12.2006 -rrb- germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all .

he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

" more than two-thirds of the seats will go to the democratic forces , " steinmeier said on monday in brussels .
" as far as i can tell , this is a good basis for serbia to form a government that will put it on the european path . " the radical party claimed victory in serbian general elections on sunday after estimations put the formation in front , but conceded it had failed to get an outright majority and was unlikely to form a government . based on partial , unofficial results , the radical party had garnered 28.7 percent of votes .
the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . pro-european coalition expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's javier solana wants a reliable partner in serbia " i hope very much that there could be the formation of a government with pro-european and democratic forces , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday . " the majority from the elections is a majority which is for democratic forces , " solana said . as solana spoke , eu ambassadors were meeting to draw up a position on the polls for the ministers to debate over lunch . officials in brussels have said the bloc dearly wanted to see a moderate coalition emerge that is ready to cooperate with the un war crimes court , possibly leading to the unblocking of talks on closer ties . mounting problems but the strength of the serbian radical party - whose president vojislav seselj is awaiting trial at the un court - means it could take a long time to form a coalition , which could raise tensions in kosovo with its ethnic albanian majority increasingly impatient for independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo remains one of the biggest challenges facing the future serbian government " it 's up to the serbs what government they form , but i think their approach should be a european one , " said luxembourg 's foreign minister , jean asselborn . the eu froze a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with belgrade in may chiefly for its failure to surrender to the tribunal former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic , who was believed to be hiding in serbia . the accord is a first step for balkan states to join europe 's rich club , and serbia is desperate to enter the bloc and rebuild its economy " everyone knows what they have to do as far as the saa is concerned , but we will have to see , " asselborn said .

at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . as part of the red army faction raf " second generation " - after the founders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicides in jail in 1976 and 1977 , mohnhaupt led a 1977 raf kidnapping in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , was seized from his car , and found dead 44 days later . she was arrested in 1982 . a humane gesture " an act of clemency would be a humane gesture , " said green party politician volker beck .
" it would be a signal of reconciliation , which is appropriate after more than 20 years in prison . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims . " schleyer 's widow , on the other hand , was appalled by the prospect of a former terrorist being released from prison . " do not set my husband 's killer free , " waltrude schleyer told the daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
" i will never be able to forgive brigitte mohnhaupt .
to this day , she never apologized to me . " calm and self-confident prison officials say mohnhaupt has been well-behaved in the prison in bavaria and no longer poses threat to society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf officially ceased to exist in 1998 " i am certain that she will never commit another crime again , " prison warden wolfgang deuschl told the web site of the german weekly stern .
" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . as part of the red army faction raf " second generation " - after the founders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicides in jail in 1976 and 1977 , mohnhaupt led a 1977 raf kidnapping in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , was seized from his car , and found dead 44 days later . she was arrested in 1982 . a humane gesture " an act of clemency would be a humane gesture , " said green party politician volker beck .
" it would be a signal of reconciliation , which is appropriate after more than 20 years in prison . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims .

" do not set my husband 's killer free , " waltrude schleyer told the daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
" i will never be able to forgive brigitte mohnhaupt .

" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

but the christian democrats collected 10,000 signatures in a petition to force a referendum on the issue . majority vote leads to name change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke was a controversial figure some 16.6 percent of the 182,000 eligible voters took part in the ballot , 1.6 per cent more than the 15 percent needed for it to be valid .
a majority of 57.1 per cent voted in favor of the name change , local officials said . one of the most vocal opponents of the student leader at the time was germany 's powerful axel springer media concern , whose offices face onto the street .

but the christian democrats collected 10,000 signatures in a petition to force a referendum on the issue . majority vote leads to name change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke was a controversial figure some 16.6 percent of the 182,000 eligible voters took part in the ballot , 1.6 per cent more than the 15 percent needed for it to be valid .
a majority of 57.1 per cent voted in favor of the name change , local officials said . one of the most vocal opponents of the student leader at the time was germany 's powerful axel springer media concern , whose offices face onto the street .

at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . as part of the red army faction raf " second generation " - after the founders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicides in jail in 1976 and 1977 , mohnhaupt led a 1977 raf kidnapping in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , was seized from his car , and found dead 44 days later . she was arrested in 1982 . a humane gesture " an act of clemency would be a humane gesture , " said green party politician volker beck .
" it would be a signal of reconciliation , which is appropriate after more than 20 years in prison . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims .

" do not set my husband 's killer free , " waltrude schleyer told the daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
" i will never be able to forgive brigitte mohnhaupt .
to this day , she never apologized to me . " calm and self-confident prison officials say mohnhaupt has been well-behaved in the prison in bavaria and no longer poses threat to society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf officially ceased to exist in 1998 " i am certain that she will never commit another crime again , " prison warden wolfgang deuschl told the web site of the german weekly stern .
" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

i am very disturbed , actually mad . - trudy miller , us the government has no right to tell people how to think . - richard spurgeon , us it is almost criminal to try to curtail and legislate the freedom of other people over a german-jewish confrontation that happened prior to the existence of the eu .
with this intent germany , is writing a sure ticket for sectarian violence in europe , to say the least .
one can not legislate history , but one can make sure that history does not repeat itself . - hans reuther-fix i am jewish .
some of my relatives were killed in 1941 in kiev .
it might surprise you that i am strongly against the proposed law .
i believe making holocaust denial a crime is potentially harmful and will make many people think that perhaps there is some truth to it if it is restricted .
i 've already heard some people say , " if it is the truth , how come it is forbidden to discuss it ? "
not to mention that it will put us , the jews , into a " special " category again , which is very undesirable .
instead , i suggest a broader law against presenting fabricated or fraudulent evidence on historic events .
this will be a fair and much more efficient filter against political extremists of all kinds .
and in the case of holocaust deniers -lrb- who usually use forged arguments -rrb- , it will not only get them punished , but also make sure they do n't have any followers . - vadim berman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can remembrance be reconciled with free speech ?
truth needs no laws to support it .
truth can withstand examination time and again .
throughout history , only lies and liars have resorted to the courts to enforce adherence to dogma . - michael davis in a free country , every person should have freedom of speech , no matter how senseless their opinions are , including freedom of religion . - else buegge-wood jesus-denial was a crime in the 15th century , so holocaust denial can be a crime in 21st century .
after all , every faith persecutes its heretics . - kazimierz a total rejection of the holocaust should be made a crime in the eu , because it is part of european history in a broad sense .
even though the holocaust was planned and executed by the nazi-regime in germany between 1936-1945 , the lessons of this crime against humanity , and the responsibility for not allowing such atrocities to happen again , is international .
by making a denial of the holocaust a crime , we also give the victims of the holocaust the sole control over their own painful memories , and history .
they will have the final say on the crime committed against them . - jansen compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? -lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- convicted holocaust denier irving expelled from austria convicted british holocaust denier david irving arrived in britain after austria expelled him and banned him from ever returning .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .

but the christian democrats collected 10,000 signatures in a petition to force a referendum on the issue . majority vote leads to name change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke was a controversial figure some 16.6 percent of the 182,000 eligible voters took part in the ballot , 1.6 per cent more than the 15 percent needed for it to be valid .
a majority of 57.1 per cent voted in favor of the name change , local officials said . one of the most vocal opponents of the student leader at the time was germany 's powerful axel springer media concern , whose offices face onto the street .

the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . " we have won as we had expected , " nikolic , the radicals ' candidate for prime minister , told afp .
pro-eu forces control majority but serbian president boris tadic said the polls were a breakthrough for pro-european union forces , which he urged to form a coalition government as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic would like to see his democratic party lead the new government " all parties supporting a pro-european stance won a majority and this is an important signal that serbia will send to europe and the world , " said tadic , the leader of the ds . tadic 's democrats are now being tipped to form a government with moderate nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and g17 plus . the three main groupings were followed by the reformist g17 plus party with 6.8 percent , milosevic 's socialist party of serbia with 5.9 percent and a neo-liberal alliance led by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- with 5.3 percent . " it 's necessary to form the government as soon as possible in order to start solving all problems that are awaiting us , " said tadic . nikolic , an outspoken critic of the un administration in kosovo , the european union and international war crimes trials against serbs , said he was " not convinced that we -lrb- the radicals -rrb- will be able to form the government .

the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . " we have won as we had expected , " nikolic , the radicals ' candidate for prime minister , told afp .
pro-eu forces control majority but serbian president boris tadic said the polls were a breakthrough for pro-european union forces , which he urged to form a coalition government as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic would like to see his democratic party lead the new government " all parties supporting a pro-european stance won a majority and this is an important signal that serbia will send to europe and the world , " said tadic , the leader of the ds . tadic 's democrats are now being tipped to form a government with moderate nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and g17 plus . the three main groupings were followed by the reformist g17 plus party with 6.8 percent , milosevic 's socialist party of serbia with 5.9 percent and a neo-liberal alliance led by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- with 5.3 percent . " it 's necessary to form the government as soon as possible in order to start solving all problems that are awaiting us , " said tadic . nikolic , an outspoken critic of the un administration in kosovo , the european union and international war crimes trials against serbs , said he was " not convinced that we -lrb- the radicals -rrb- will be able to form the government . " he earlier ruled out forming a government with major opponents and warned moderate parties would " surrender " serbia 's sovereignty over kosovo .

the issue stirred many dw-world.de readers to share their thoughts . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . some people deny that jesus is the lord .
some say there is no such thing as global warming .
some say the holocaust did not happen .
making it a crime to have a different opinion is awful .
it seems to me that saying anything against jews is a crime already .
saying anything against hitler was a crime in those days .
are we going in that direction again ?
i am very disturbed , actually mad . - trudy miller , us the government has no right to tell people how to think . - richard spurgeon , us it is almost criminal to try to curtail and legislate the freedom of other people over a german-jewish confrontation that happened prior to the existence of the eu .
with this intent germany , is writing a sure ticket for sectarian violence in europe , to say the least .
one can not legislate history , but one can make sure that history does not repeat itself . - hans reuther-fix i am jewish .
some of my relatives were killed in 1941 in kiev .
it might surprise you that i am strongly against the proposed law .
i believe making holocaust denial a crime is potentially harmful and will make many people think that perhaps there is some truth to it if it is restricted .
i 've already heard some people say , " if it is the truth , how come it is forbidden to discuss it ? "
not to mention that it will put us , the jews , into a " special " category again , which is very undesirable .
instead , i suggest a broader law against presenting fabricated or fraudulent evidence on historic events .
this will be a fair and much more efficient filter against political extremists of all kinds .
and in the case of holocaust deniers -lrb- who usually use forged arguments -rrb- , it will not only get them punished , but also make sure they do n't have any followers . - vadim berman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can remembrance be reconciled with free speech ?
truth needs no laws to support it .
truth can withstand examination time and again .
throughout history , only lies and liars have resorted to the courts to enforce adherence to dogma . - michael davis in a free country , every person should have freedom of speech , no matter how senseless their opinions are , including freedom of religion . - else buegge-wood jesus-denial was a crime in the 15th century , so holocaust denial can be a crime in 21st century .
after all , every faith persecutes its heretics . - kazimierz a total rejection of the holocaust should be made a crime in the eu , because it is part of european history in a broad sense .
even though the holocaust was planned and executed by the nazi-regime in germany between 1936-1945 , the lessons of this crime against humanity , and the responsibility for not allowing such atrocities to happen again , is international .
by making a denial of the holocaust a crime , we also give the victims of the holocaust the sole control over their own painful memories , and history .
they will have the final say on the crime committed against them . - jansen compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .

" the chancellor has a very close relationship with the foreign minister , which is based on trust , " said government spokesman thomas steg at a monday press conference .
" -lrb- she -rrb- goes on the assumption that the two will continue their successful work together . " steinmeier is being asked to explain his role in the prolonged detention of murat kurnaz in the us military prison in cuba .
kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years in there after his arrest as a suspected al qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the sept.11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . secret government documents circulating in the german media claim the us offered to release him in 2002 after concluding that he was not a terrorist , but that germany refused to take him back . the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung claimed steinmeier was actively involved in his role as coordinator of the country 's intelligence services under the then government of chancellor gerhard schröder . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 on the intervention of the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . committee investigation last week he appeared before a parliamentary panel investigating whether the country 's foreign intelligence service bnd breached german regulations while assisting us anti-terrorism operations after sept.11. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was questioned in front of the investigative committee in december steinmeier is scheduled to appear before the committee after kurnaz gives evidence again on feb .
1 and the agents who interrogated him at guantanamo are also questioned . both steg and foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said that the government could not comment on the allegations in detail because some of the documents involved are classified .
plötner said , however , that steinmeier was eager for the investigative committee to conclude its questioning of preliminary witnesses so that he would be able to " clear up the matter quickly . " kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday . " i 'm certain that when he addresses the panel he will be able to demonstrate that he acted without reproach , " he said . indignities the bearded kurnaz , 24 , described how he was subjected to physical and psychological abuse by his us captors that included being sprayed with " knock-out " gas and chained up for 12 hours a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz kurnaz 's account of the indignities he suffered during his time in guantanamo " got under my skin , " said max stadler , an opposition free democrat member of the parliamentary committee .
" it makes you really angry to learn that an innocent man was forced to spend five years in such conditions . " kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

" more than two-thirds of the seats will go to the democratic forces , " steinmeier said on monday in brussels .
" as far as i can tell , this is a good basis for serbia to form a government that will put it on the european path . " the radical party claimed victory in serbian general elections on sunday after estimations put the formation in front , but conceded it had failed to get an outright majority and was unlikely to form a government . based on partial , unofficial results , the radical party had garnered 28.7 percent of votes .
the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . pro-european coalition expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's javier solana wants a reliable partner in serbia " i hope very much that there could be the formation of a government with pro-european and democratic forces , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday . " the majority from the elections is a majority which is for democratic forces , " solana said . as solana spoke , eu ambassadors were meeting to draw up a position on the polls for the ministers to debate over lunch . officials in brussels have said the bloc dearly wanted to see a moderate coalition emerge that is ready to cooperate with the un war crimes court , possibly leading to the unblocking of talks on closer ties . mounting problems but the strength of the serbian radical party - whose president vojislav seselj is awaiting trial at the un court - means it could take a long time to form a coalition , which could raise tensions in kosovo with its ethnic albanian majority increasingly impatient for independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo remains one of the biggest challenges facing the future serbian government " it 's up to the serbs what government they form , but i think their approach should be a european one , " said luxembourg 's foreign minister , jean asselborn . the eu froze a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with belgrade in may chiefly for its failure to surrender to the tribunal former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic , who was believed to be hiding in serbia . the accord is a first step for balkan states to join europe 's rich club , and serbia is desperate to enter the bloc and rebuild its economy " everyone knows what they have to do as far as the saa is concerned , but we will have to see , " asselborn said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.01.2007 in era of globalization , unions look beyond their own borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions in germany can still get a crowd out into the streets , but their power is waning to provide a counterweight to multinational companies , trade unions in germany , britain and the us have signed agreements pledging closer cooperation .
it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .
" but we have to represent our employees ' interests , and this is likely going to be the way to do it . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .

" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.01.2007 in era of globalization , unions look beyond their own borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions in germany can still get a crowd out into the streets , but their power is waning to provide a counterweight to multinational companies , trade unions in germany , britain and the us have signed agreements pledging closer cooperation .
it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .
" but we have to represent our employees ' interests , and this is likely going to be the way to do it .

the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . " we have won as we had expected , " nikolic , the radicals ' candidate for prime minister , told afp .
pro-eu forces control majority but serbian president boris tadic said the polls were a breakthrough for pro-european union forces , which he urged to form a coalition government as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic would like to see his democratic party lead the new government " all parties supporting a pro-european stance won a majority and this is an important signal that serbia will send to europe and the world , " said tadic , the leader of the ds . tadic 's democrats are now being tipped to form a government with moderate nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and g17 plus . the three main groupings were followed by the reformist g17 plus party with 6.8 percent , milosevic 's socialist party of serbia with 5.9 percent and a neo-liberal alliance led by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- with 5.3 percent . " it 's necessary to form the government as soon as possible in order to start solving all problems that are awaiting us , " said tadic . nikolic , an outspoken critic of the un administration in kosovo , the european union and international war crimes trials against serbs , said he was " not convinced that we -lrb- the radicals -rrb- will be able to form the government . " he earlier ruled out forming a government with major opponents and warned moderate parties would " surrender " serbia 's sovereignty over kosovo .
kosovo remains critical issue sunday 's election came with serbia on the brink of losing kosovo , its historic heartland which has been run by the united nations since the end of the 1998-1999 war between serb forces and ethnic albanian guerrillas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic says the radical party would not " surrender " kosovo un envoy martti ahtisaari is expected to propose a form of independence for kosovo next week , which the international community hopes will resolve the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s . ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , are seeking independence , a demand staunchly opposed by serbia which is willing to consider only a form of broad autonomy . the un envoy delayed his long-awaited proposal until after the polls so as not to inflame nationalist sentiment in serbia at election time . asked by reporters whether he would accept kosovo 's independence , tadic said : " loud and clear , the answer is no . " and kostunica , a fervent opponent of kosovo 's independence , is expected to fight to hold on to his position , possibly in a bid to delay the formation of a coalition government and impact on the kosovo process .
result to be confirmed thursday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica , left , needs coalition partners to stay in power but he said his party was ready for talks on a new cabinet " as soon as final results are known , " alluding to a jan .
25 deadline for the electoral commission to confirm the vote outcome . " what 's more important is to have a consensus in the parliament ... especially when future status of kosovo is in question , " said kostunica . kosovo was a central theme of election campaigning ahead of a united nations decision next week on the future status of the breakaway province which has been run by a un mission since its 1998-1999 war . serbians voted for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups .
kosovo albanians are excluded from rolls , having boycotted serbian elections since the early 1990s . some 500 international and 5,000 local observers monitored the vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbian polls to decide if country 's future will be european serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?

but the christian democrats collected 10,000 signatures in a petition to force a referendum on the issue . majority vote leads to name change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke was a controversial figure some 16.6 percent of the 182,000 eligible voters took part in the ballot , 1.6 per cent more than the 15 percent needed for it to be valid .
a majority of 57.1 per cent voted in favor of the name change , local officials said . one of the most vocal opponents of the student leader at the time was germany 's powerful axel springer media concern , whose offices face onto the street .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .
however , he , for one , has got used to it .
his sister hülya agrees with him and credits the professional film team with putting the family at ease .
this , she believes , has made shooting the show very easy . an extraordinarily ordinary family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work and at play , the camera is always there author and director ute diehl wanted to make a show about an ordinary family which was extraordinary .
and when she was approached to portray a turkish family in the role , she was inspired immediately . " i still have the feeling that this is a very amusing world which we have not seen in its entirety yet , " says diehl .
" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .

" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .
" but we have to represent our employees ' interests , and this is likely going to be the way to do it .

" kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday .

" kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

it can be a very stressful business .
but a german man threw caution to the wind and took his wife out for a quiet lesson .
or that 's what he thought . when learning to drive , it 's often safest for all those involved to take those first tentative steps towards auto proficiency on a quiet little stretch of road .
there , the inexperienced driver can toddle along at a snail 's pace without infuriating the other road users or putting anyone 's life at risk . this was surely the intention of the caring husband who decided to ease his young bride into the driver 's seat with a leisurely lesson on a deserted stretch of asphalt . unfortunately , while hubby obviously had his beloved 's best interests at heart , he had n't thought the whole thing through .
which is why the inexperienced young lady found herself on one of germany 's fasted race tracks on the saturday afternoon when it is given over to speeding lunatics . wrongly thinking the nürburgring would be a model of solitude and safety on a weekend when there was no scheduled formula one , touring car or superbike race , the 31-year-old man inadvertently introduced his nervous spouse to the thrills and spills of high-speed circuit driving . wrong time , wrong place , wrong direction if the fact that they had turned up on the day that private drivers were allowed to take their souped-up bmw 's and mercedes ' out on the track was n't bad enough , the small matter of taking to the ring in the wrong direction only made matters worse . after avoiding speeding vehicles whizzing towards her at more than 100 kilometers per hour , the driver and her husband were accosted by local police who , after finding that the wife had no license , promptly gave them a ticket . assuming the fine , the possibility of a ban and the near-death experience does n't completely ruin her confidence , the 20-year-old learner will certainly have a tale to tell the driving instructor when she begins official lessons .
that is , if she can stop shaking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racing porsche mistaken for landing strip a member of a private german racing club had the shock of his life when a single-seater plane swooped out of the sky and landed on the roof of his speeding vehicle on wednesday .

at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . as part of the red army faction raf " second generation " - after the founders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicides in jail in 1976 and 1977 , mohnhaupt led a 1977 raf kidnapping in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , was seized from his car , and found dead 44 days later . she was arrested in 1982 . a humane gesture " an act of clemency would be a humane gesture , " said green party politician volker beck .
" it would be a signal of reconciliation , which is appropriate after more than 20 years in prison . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims . " schleyer 's widow , on the other hand , was appalled by the prospect of a former terrorist being released from prison . " do not set my husband 's killer free , " waltrude schleyer told the daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
" i will never be able to forgive brigitte mohnhaupt .
to this day , she never apologized to me . " calm and self-confident prison officials say mohnhaupt has been well-behaved in the prison in bavaria and no longer poses threat to society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf officially ceased to exist in 1998 " i am certain that she will never commit another crime again , " prison warden wolfgang deuschl told the web site of the german weekly stern .
" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?
chancellor angela merkel made an appeal this week for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy and questioned germany 's phase-out plans .

the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . " we have won as we had expected , " nikolic , the radicals ' candidate for prime minister , told afp .
pro-eu forces control majority but serbian president boris tadic said the polls were a breakthrough for pro-european union forces , which he urged to form a coalition government as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic would like to see his democratic party lead the new government " all parties supporting a pro-european stance won a majority and this is an important signal that serbia will send to europe and the world , " said tadic , the leader of the ds . tadic 's democrats are now being tipped to form a government with moderate nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and g17 plus . the three main groupings were followed by the reformist g17 plus party with 6.8 percent , milosevic 's socialist party of serbia with 5.9 percent and a neo-liberal alliance led by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- with 5.3 percent . " it 's necessary to form the government as soon as possible in order to start solving all problems that are awaiting us , " said tadic . nikolic , an outspoken critic of the un administration in kosovo , the european union and international war crimes trials against serbs , said he was " not convinced that we -lrb- the radicals -rrb- will be able to form the government . " he earlier ruled out forming a government with major opponents and warned moderate parties would " surrender " serbia 's sovereignty over kosovo .
kosovo remains critical issue sunday 's election came with serbia on the brink of losing kosovo , its historic heartland which has been run by the united nations since the end of the 1998-1999 war between serb forces and ethnic albanian guerrillas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic says the radical party would not " surrender " kosovo un envoy martti ahtisaari is expected to propose a form of independence for kosovo next week , which the international community hopes will resolve the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s . ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , are seeking independence , a demand staunchly opposed by serbia which is willing to consider only a form of broad autonomy . the un envoy delayed his long-awaited proposal until after the polls so as not to inflame nationalist sentiment in serbia at election time . asked by reporters whether he would accept kosovo 's independence , tadic said : " loud and clear , the answer is no . " and kostunica , a fervent opponent of kosovo 's independence , is expected to fight to hold on to his position , possibly in a bid to delay the formation of a coalition government and impact on the kosovo process .
result to be confirmed thursday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica , left , needs coalition partners to stay in power but he said his party was ready for talks on a new cabinet " as soon as final results are known , " alluding to a jan .

it can be a very stressful business .
but a german man threw caution to the wind and took his wife out for a quiet lesson .
or that 's what he thought . when learning to drive , it 's often safest for all those involved to take those first tentative steps towards auto proficiency on a quiet little stretch of road .
there , the inexperienced driver can toddle along at a snail 's pace without infuriating the other road users or putting anyone 's life at risk . this was surely the intention of the caring husband who decided to ease his young bride into the driver 's seat with a leisurely lesson on a deserted stretch of asphalt . unfortunately , while hubby obviously had his beloved 's best interests at heart , he had n't thought the whole thing through .
which is why the inexperienced young lady found herself on one of germany 's fasted race tracks on the saturday afternoon when it is given over to speeding lunatics . wrongly thinking the nürburgring would be a model of solitude and safety on a weekend when there was no scheduled formula one , touring car or superbike race , the 31-year-old man inadvertently introduced his nervous spouse to the thrills and spills of high-speed circuit driving . wrong time , wrong place , wrong direction if the fact that they had turned up on the day that private drivers were allowed to take their souped-up bmw 's and mercedes ' out on the track was n't bad enough , the small matter of taking to the ring in the wrong direction only made matters worse . after avoiding speeding vehicles whizzing towards her at more than 100 kilometers per hour , the driver and her husband were accosted by local police who , after finding that the wife had no license , promptly gave them a ticket . assuming the fine , the possibility of a ban and the near-death experience does n't completely ruin her confidence , the 20-year-old learner will certainly have a tale to tell the driving instructor when she begins official lessons .
that is , if she can stop shaking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racing porsche mistaken for landing strip a member of a private german racing club had the shock of his life when a single-seater plane swooped out of the sky and landed on the roof of his speeding vehicle on wednesday .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .

at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . as part of the red army faction raf " second generation " - after the founders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicides in jail in 1976 and 1977 , mohnhaupt led a 1977 raf kidnapping in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , was seized from his car , and found dead 44 days later . she was arrested in 1982 . a humane gesture " an act of clemency would be a humane gesture , " said green party politician volker beck .
" it would be a signal of reconciliation , which is appropriate after more than 20 years in prison . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims . " schleyer 's widow , on the other hand , was appalled by the prospect of a former terrorist being released from prison . " do not set my husband 's killer free , " waltrude schleyer told the daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
" i will never be able to forgive brigitte mohnhaupt .
to this day , she never apologized to me . " calm and self-confident prison officials say mohnhaupt has been well-behaved in the prison in bavaria and no longer poses threat to society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf officially ceased to exist in 1998 " i am certain that she will never commit another crime again , " prison warden wolfgang deuschl told the web site of the german weekly stern .
" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de raf terrorists bid for freedom as sentences near completion germany is considering the release of two of the principal leftist terrorists who mounted a campaign of kidnapping and assassination 30 years ago and created one of germany 's worst political crises of the 1970s .

at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . as part of the red army faction raf " second generation " - after the founders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicides in jail in 1976 and 1977 , mohnhaupt led a 1977 raf kidnapping in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , was seized from his car , and found dead 44 days later . she was arrested in 1982 . a humane gesture " an act of clemency would be a humane gesture , " said green party politician volker beck .
" it would be a signal of reconciliation , which is appropriate after more than 20 years in prison . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims . " schleyer 's widow , on the other hand , was appalled by the prospect of a former terrorist being released from prison . " do not set my husband 's killer free , " waltrude schleyer told the daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
" i will never be able to forgive brigitte mohnhaupt .
to this day , she never apologized to me . " calm and self-confident prison officials say mohnhaupt has been well-behaved in the prison in bavaria and no longer poses threat to society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf officially ceased to exist in 1998 " i am certain that she will never commit another crime again , " prison warden wolfgang deuschl told the web site of the german weekly stern .
" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

it can be a very stressful business .
but a german man threw caution to the wind and took his wife out for a quiet lesson .
or that 's what he thought . when learning to drive , it 's often safest for all those involved to take those first tentative steps towards auto proficiency on a quiet little stretch of road .
there , the inexperienced driver can toddle along at a snail 's pace without infuriating the other road users or putting anyone 's life at risk . this was surely the intention of the caring husband who decided to ease his young bride into the driver 's seat with a leisurely lesson on a deserted stretch of asphalt . unfortunately , while hubby obviously had his beloved 's best interests at heart , he had n't thought the whole thing through .
which is why the inexperienced young lady found herself on one of germany 's fasted race tracks on the saturday afternoon when it is given over to speeding lunatics . wrongly thinking the nürburgring would be a model of solitude and safety on a weekend when there was no scheduled formula one , touring car or superbike race , the 31-year-old man inadvertently introduced his nervous spouse to the thrills and spills of high-speed circuit driving . wrong time , wrong place , wrong direction if the fact that they had turned up on the day that private drivers were allowed to take their souped-up bmw 's and mercedes ' out on the track was n't bad enough , the small matter of taking to the ring in the wrong direction only made matters worse . after avoiding speeding vehicles whizzing towards her at more than 100 kilometers per hour , the driver and her husband were accosted by local police who , after finding that the wife had no license , promptly gave them a ticket . assuming the fine , the possibility of a ban and the near-death experience does n't completely ruin her confidence , the 20-year-old learner will certainly have a tale to tell the driving instructor when she begins official lessons .
that is , if she can stop shaking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racing porsche mistaken for landing strip a member of a private german racing club had the shock of his life when a single-seater plane swooped out of the sky and landed on the roof of his speeding vehicle on wednesday .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?

-lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

23 .
they called on " all countries to implement the measures in full and without delay . " according to britain 's foreign secretary , margaret beckett , a coordinated enforcement of the sanctions was important to pressure iran " to accept the offer of the international community to come back to the negotiating table . " officials said the eu was already drafting rules to put the sanctions in place , which include a ban on selling materials or technology which could be used in iran 's nuclear or missile programs . ukraine ties eu foreign ministers also agreed on monday to begin talks on strengthening ties with ukraine although they papered over differences on whether the former soviet state has a future in the european bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it 's committed to supporting ukrainian democracy the ministers said that the eu remains committed to supporting ukraine 's democracy , stability and prosperity and " wishes to reinforce this commitment through a new enhanced agreement . " the eu has intended for months to start negotiating an accord on political and economic cooperation with ukraine , which would include the creation of a free-trade zone .
talks are expected to start on feb .
6 . but strong divisions remain over whether ukraine actually belongs in the bloc . while acknowledging ukraine 's " european aspirations , " the ministers avoided salting an open wound by saying that " a new enhanced agreement shall not prejudge any possible future developments in eu-ukraine relations . " britain , hungary , poland and sweden support ukraine 's ambitions to join europe 's rich club but a number of the 27 current member states - including france and spain , with the " sympathy " of germany - are fiercely opposed . they believe that ties with ukraine should evolve under the framework of the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy , " offering countries near the bloc a privileged relationship rather than under its enlargement strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko -lrb- front -rrb- wants eu accession talks to begin those hostile to ukraine 's future membership believe it is vital not to " create confusion between the eu 's neighborhood policy and its enlargement strategy , " an eu diplomat said friday . but those in favor say there is no reason why ukraine could not shift from one policy area to the other , he said . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has pressed for accession talks to start next year but eu leaders said at the last eu-ukraine summit in october that the country has not undertaken enough reforms to be a contender . northern cyprus isolation the controversial issue of the divided island of cyprus was also on the agenda and eu nations agreed to work towards lifting the trade isolation of the island 's north " without delay . " work towards the adoption of " special conditions for trade " with the north " must resume without delay , " the ministers said at the meeting 's conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers want to establish " special conditions for trade " with the island 's north in 2004 , after the greek cypriots rejected reunification plans in a referendum , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to offer financial aid to the north of the island , which voted for reunification . a total of 259 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- in eu aid has been approved for northern cyprus where there are fewer than 200,000 people . while nicosia agreed to the aid , it has remained opposed to renewed trade with the north , as that could be seen as an implicit recognition of the breakaway north . however , last month , the greek cypriots agreed to sign up to a declaration engaging the eu to work towards resolving the problem . last month eu countries agreed to partially suspend turkey 's accession talks with the bloc in punishment for ankara 's refusal to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets deadline for turkey to open up its ports the eu believes that a solution to the turkish-cypriot dispute that threatens to derail membership talks for turkey to join the 25-member bloc is still possible with help from the united nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 22.01.2007 should the eu make holocaust denial a crime ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's proposal provokes questions on freedom of speech german politicians recently said they want to make holocaust denial a crime across the eu during their country 's six-month term as head of the bloc .
the issue stirred many dw-world.de readers to share their thoughts . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . some people deny that jesus is the lord .
some say there is no such thing as global warming .
some say the holocaust did not happen .
making it a crime to have a different opinion is awful .
it seems to me that saying anything against jews is a crime already .
saying anything against hitler was a crime in those days .
are we going in that direction again ?
i am very disturbed , actually mad . - trudy miller , us the government has no right to tell people how to think . - richard spurgeon , us it is almost criminal to try to curtail and legislate the freedom of other people over a german-jewish confrontation that happened prior to the existence of the eu .
with this intent germany , is writing a sure ticket for sectarian violence in europe , to say the least .
one can not legislate history , but one can make sure that history does not repeat itself . - hans reuther-fix i am jewish .
some of my relatives were killed in 1941 in kiev .
it might surprise you that i am strongly against the proposed law .
i believe making holocaust denial a crime is potentially harmful and will make many people think that perhaps there is some truth to it if it is restricted .
i 've already heard some people say , " if it is the truth , how come it is forbidden to discuss it ? "
not to mention that it will put us , the jews , into a " special " category again , which is very undesirable .
instead , i suggest a broader law against presenting fabricated or fraudulent evidence on historic events .
this will be a fair and much more efficient filter against political extremists of all kinds .
and in the case of holocaust deniers -lrb- who usually use forged arguments -rrb- , it will not only get them punished , but also make sure they do n't have any followers . - vadim berman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can remembrance be reconciled with free speech ?
truth needs no laws to support it .
truth can withstand examination time and again .
throughout history , only lies and liars have resorted to the courts to enforce adherence to dogma . - michael davis in a free country , every person should have freedom of speech , no matter how senseless their opinions are , including freedom of religion . - else buegge-wood jesus-denial was a crime in the 15th century , so holocaust denial can be a crime in 21st century .
after all , every faith persecutes its heretics . - kazimierz a total rejection of the holocaust should be made a crime in the eu , because it is part of european history in a broad sense .
even though the holocaust was planned and executed by the nazi-regime in germany between 1936-1945 , the lessons of this crime against humanity , and the responsibility for not allowing such atrocities to happen again , is international .
by making a denial of the holocaust a crime , we also give the victims of the holocaust the sole control over their own painful memories , and history .
they will have the final say on the crime committed against them . - jansen compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? -lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- convicted holocaust denier irving expelled from austria convicted british holocaust denier david irving arrived in britain after austria expelled him and banned him from ever returning .
-lrb- 22.12.2006 -rrb- germany protests against tehran holocaust conference german lawmakers have protested against an iranian conference on the holocaust .
the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 22.01.2007 death defying driving lesson drives driver round the bend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " just remember ... keep your hands at ten to two and do n't worry about the other drivers " most people draw the line at teaching their partner how to drive .
it can be a very stressful business .
but a german man threw caution to the wind and took his wife out for a quiet lesson .
or that 's what he thought . when learning to drive , it 's often safest for all those involved to take those first tentative steps towards auto proficiency on a quiet little stretch of road .
there , the inexperienced driver can toddle along at a snail 's pace without infuriating the other road users or putting anyone 's life at risk . this was surely the intention of the caring husband who decided to ease his young bride into the driver 's seat with a leisurely lesson on a deserted stretch of asphalt . unfortunately , while hubby obviously had his beloved 's best interests at heart , he had n't thought the whole thing through .
which is why the inexperienced young lady found herself on one of germany 's fasted race tracks on the saturday afternoon when it is given over to speeding lunatics . wrongly thinking the nürburgring would be a model of solitude and safety on a weekend when there was no scheduled formula one , touring car or superbike race , the 31-year-old man inadvertently introduced his nervous spouse to the thrills and spills of high-speed circuit driving . wrong time , wrong place , wrong direction if the fact that they had turned up on the day that private drivers were allowed to take their souped-up bmw 's and mercedes ' out on the track was n't bad enough , the small matter of taking to the ring in the wrong direction only made matters worse . after avoiding speeding vehicles whizzing towards her at more than 100 kilometers per hour , the driver and her husband were accosted by local police who , after finding that the wife had no license , promptly gave them a ticket . assuming the fine , the possibility of a ban and the near-death experience does n't completely ruin her confidence , the 20-year-old learner will certainly have a tale to tell the driving instructor when she begins official lessons .
that is , if she can stop shaking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racing porsche mistaken for landing strip a member of a private german racing club had the shock of his life when a single-seater plane swooped out of the sky and landed on the roof of his speeding vehicle on wednesday .

" the chancellor has a very close relationship with the foreign minister , which is based on trust , " said government spokesman thomas steg at a monday press conference .
" -lrb- she -rrb- goes on the assumption that the two will continue their successful work together . " steinmeier is being asked to explain his role in the prolonged detention of murat kurnaz in the us military prison in cuba .
kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years in there after his arrest as a suspected al qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the sept.11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . secret government documents circulating in the german media claim the us offered to release him in 2002 after concluding that he was not a terrorist , but that germany refused to take him back . the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung claimed steinmeier was actively involved in his role as coordinator of the country 's intelligence services under the then government of chancellor gerhard schröder . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 on the intervention of the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . committee investigation last week he appeared before a parliamentary panel investigating whether the country 's foreign intelligence service bnd breached german regulations while assisting us anti-terrorism operations after sept.11. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was questioned in front of the investigative committee in december steinmeier is scheduled to appear before the committee after kurnaz gives evidence again on feb .
1 and the agents who interrogated him at guantanamo are also questioned . both steg and foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said that the government could not comment on the allegations in detail because some of the documents involved are classified .
plötner said , however , that steinmeier was eager for the investigative committee to conclude its questioning of preliminary witnesses so that he would be able to " clear up the matter quickly . " kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday . " i 'm certain that when he addresses the panel he will be able to demonstrate that he acted without reproach , " he said . indignities the bearded kurnaz , 24 , described how he was subjected to physical and psychological abuse by his us captors that included being sprayed with " knock-out " gas and chained up for 12 hours a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz kurnaz 's account of the indignities he suffered during his time in guantanamo " got under my skin , " said max stadler , an opposition free democrat member of the parliamentary committee .
" it makes you really angry to learn that an innocent man was forced to spend five years in such conditions . " kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .
" but we have to represent our employees ' interests , and this is likely going to be the way to do it .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .
however , he , for one , has got used to it .
his sister hülya agrees with him and credits the professional film team with putting the family at ease .
this , she believes , has made shooting the show very easy . an extraordinarily ordinary family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work and at play , the camera is always there author and director ute diehl wanted to make a show about an ordinary family which was extraordinary .
and when she was approached to portray a turkish family in the role , she was inspired immediately . " i still have the feeling that this is a very amusing world which we have not seen in its entirety yet , " says diehl .
" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .

the issue stirred many dw-world.de readers to share their thoughts . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . some people deny that jesus is the lord .
some say there is no such thing as global warming .
some say the holocaust did not happen .
making it a crime to have a different opinion is awful .
it seems to me that saying anything against jews is a crime already .
saying anything against hitler was a crime in those days .
are we going in that direction again ?
i am very disturbed , actually mad . - trudy miller , us the government has no right to tell people how to think . - richard spurgeon , us it is almost criminal to try to curtail and legislate the freedom of other people over a german-jewish confrontation that happened prior to the existence of the eu .
with this intent germany , is writing a sure ticket for sectarian violence in europe , to say the least .
one can not legislate history , but one can make sure that history does not repeat itself . - hans reuther-fix i am jewish .
some of my relatives were killed in 1941 in kiev .
it might surprise you that i am strongly against the proposed law .
i believe making holocaust denial a crime is potentially harmful and will make many people think that perhaps there is some truth to it if it is restricted .
i 've already heard some people say , " if it is the truth , how come it is forbidden to discuss it ? "
not to mention that it will put us , the jews , into a " special " category again , which is very undesirable .
instead , i suggest a broader law against presenting fabricated or fraudulent evidence on historic events .
this will be a fair and much more efficient filter against political extremists of all kinds .
and in the case of holocaust deniers -lrb- who usually use forged arguments -rrb- , it will not only get them punished , but also make sure they do n't have any followers . - vadim berman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can remembrance be reconciled with free speech ?
truth needs no laws to support it .
truth can withstand examination time and again .
throughout history , only lies and liars have resorted to the courts to enforce adherence to dogma . - michael davis in a free country , every person should have freedom of speech , no matter how senseless their opinions are , including freedom of religion . - else buegge-wood jesus-denial was a crime in the 15th century , so holocaust denial can be a crime in 21st century .
after all , every faith persecutes its heretics . - kazimierz a total rejection of the holocaust should be made a crime in the eu , because it is part of european history in a broad sense .
even though the holocaust was planned and executed by the nazi-regime in germany between 1936-1945 , the lessons of this crime against humanity , and the responsibility for not allowing such atrocities to happen again , is international .
by making a denial of the holocaust a crime , we also give the victims of the holocaust the sole control over their own painful memories , and history .
they will have the final say on the crime committed against them . - jansen compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? -lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- convicted holocaust denier irving expelled from austria convicted british holocaust denier david irving arrived in britain after austria expelled him and banned him from ever returning .
-lrb- 22.12.2006 -rrb- germany protests against tehran holocaust conference german lawmakers have protested against an iranian conference on the holocaust .
the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis .

" the chancellor has a very close relationship with the foreign minister , which is based on trust , " said government spokesman thomas steg at a monday press conference .

plötner said , however , that steinmeier was eager for the investigative committee to conclude its questioning of preliminary witnesses so that he would be able to " clear up the matter quickly . " kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday .

" it makes you really angry to learn that an innocent man was forced to spend five years in such conditions . " kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?
chancellor angela merkel made an appeal this week for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy and questioned germany 's phase-out plans .

but the christian democrats collected 10,000 signatures in a petition to force a referendum on the issue . majority vote leads to name change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke was a controversial figure some 16.6 percent of the 182,000 eligible voters took part in the ballot , 1.6 per cent more than the 15 percent needed for it to be valid .
a majority of 57.1 per cent voted in favor of the name change , local officials said . one of the most vocal opponents of the student leader at the time was germany 's powerful axel springer media concern , whose offices face onto the street .

" the chancellor has a very close relationship with the foreign minister , which is based on trust , " said government spokesman thomas steg at a monday press conference .

plötner said , however , that steinmeier was eager for the investigative committee to conclude its questioning of preliminary witnesses so that he would be able to " clear up the matter quickly . " kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday .

" it makes you really angry to learn that an innocent man was forced to spend five years in such conditions . " kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

but the christian democrats collected 10,000 signatures in a petition to force a referendum on the issue . majority vote leads to name change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke was a controversial figure some 16.6 percent of the 182,000 eligible voters took part in the ballot , 1.6 per cent more than the 15 percent needed for it to be valid .
a majority of 57.1 per cent voted in favor of the name change , local officials said . one of the most vocal opponents of the student leader at the time was germany 's powerful axel springer media concern , whose offices face onto the street .

at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . as part of the red army faction raf " second generation " - after the founders ulrike meinhof , andreas baader and gudrun ensslin committed suicides in jail in 1976 and 1977 , mohnhaupt led a 1977 raf kidnapping in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , was seized from his car , and found dead 44 days later . she was arrested in 1982 . a humane gesture " an act of clemency would be a humane gesture , " said green party politician volker beck .
" it would be a signal of reconciliation , which is appropriate after more than 20 years in prison . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims .

" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .
" but we have to represent our employees ' interests , and this is likely going to be the way to do it .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .
however , he , for one , has got used to it .
his sister hülya agrees with him and credits the professional film team with putting the family at ease .
this , she believes , has made shooting the show very easy . an extraordinarily ordinary family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work and at play , the camera is always there author and director ute diehl wanted to make a show about an ordinary family which was extraordinary .
and when she was approached to portray a turkish family in the role , she was inspired immediately . " i still have the feeling that this is a very amusing world which we have not seen in its entirety yet , " says diehl .
" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .
the series provides a good opportunity to show people that many families live quite differently from them but not the way most think they do . silke schmidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love , lust and betrayal : german writers discover the small screen will ansgar stay with tanja and her baby ?

it can be a very stressful business .
but a german man threw caution to the wind and took his wife out for a quiet lesson .
or that 's what he thought . when learning to drive , it 's often safest for all those involved to take those first tentative steps towards auto proficiency on a quiet little stretch of road .
there , the inexperienced driver can toddle along at a snail 's pace without infuriating the other road users or putting anyone 's life at risk . this was surely the intention of the caring husband who decided to ease his young bride into the driver 's seat with a leisurely lesson on a deserted stretch of asphalt . unfortunately , while hubby obviously had his beloved 's best interests at heart , he had n't thought the whole thing through .
which is why the inexperienced young lady found herself on one of germany 's fasted race tracks on the saturday afternoon when it is given over to speeding lunatics . wrongly thinking the nürburgring would be a model of solitude and safety on a weekend when there was no scheduled formula one , touring car or superbike race , the 31-year-old man inadvertently introduced his nervous spouse to the thrills and spills of high-speed circuit driving . wrong time , wrong place , wrong direction if the fact that they had turned up on the day that private drivers were allowed to take their souped-up bmw 's and mercedes ' out on the track was n't bad enough , the small matter of taking to the ring in the wrong direction only made matters worse . after avoiding speeding vehicles whizzing towards her at more than 100 kilometers per hour , the driver and her husband were accosted by local police who , after finding that the wife had no license , promptly gave them a ticket . assuming the fine , the possibility of a ban and the near-death experience does n't completely ruin her confidence , the 20-year-old learner will certainly have a tale to tell the driving instructor when she begins official lessons .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .
however , he , for one , has got used to it .
his sister hülya agrees with him and credits the professional film team with putting the family at ease .
this , she believes , has made shooting the show very easy . an extraordinarily ordinary family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work and at play , the camera is always there author and director ute diehl wanted to make a show about an ordinary family which was extraordinary .
and when she was approached to portray a turkish family in the role , she was inspired immediately . " i still have the feeling that this is a very amusing world which we have not seen in its entirety yet , " says diehl .
" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .

23 .
they called on " all countries to implement the measures in full and without delay . " according to britain 's foreign secretary , margaret beckett , a coordinated enforcement of the sanctions was important to pressure iran " to accept the offer of the international community to come back to the negotiating table . " officials said the eu was already drafting rules to put the sanctions in place , which include a ban on selling materials or technology which could be used in iran 's nuclear or missile programs . ukraine ties eu foreign ministers also agreed on monday to begin talks on strengthening ties with ukraine although they papered over differences on whether the former soviet state has a future in the european bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it 's committed to supporting ukrainian democracy the ministers said that the eu remains committed to supporting ukraine 's democracy , stability and prosperity and " wishes to reinforce this commitment through a new enhanced agreement . " the eu has intended for months to start negotiating an accord on political and economic cooperation with ukraine , which would include the creation of a free-trade zone .

23 .
they called on " all countries to implement the measures in full and without delay . " according to britain 's foreign secretary , margaret beckett , a coordinated enforcement of the sanctions was important to pressure iran " to accept the offer of the international community to come back to the negotiating table . " officials said the eu was already drafting rules to put the sanctions in place , which include a ban on selling materials or technology which could be used in iran 's nuclear or missile programs . ukraine ties eu foreign ministers also agreed on monday to begin talks on strengthening ties with ukraine although they papered over differences on whether the former soviet state has a future in the european bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it 's committed to supporting ukrainian democracy the ministers said that the eu remains committed to supporting ukraine 's democracy , stability and prosperity and " wishes to reinforce this commitment through a new enhanced agreement . " the eu has intended for months to start negotiating an accord on political and economic cooperation with ukraine , which would include the creation of a free-trade zone .
talks are expected to start on feb .
6 . but strong divisions remain over whether ukraine actually belongs in the bloc . while acknowledging ukraine 's " european aspirations , " the ministers avoided salting an open wound by saying that " a new enhanced agreement shall not prejudge any possible future developments in eu-ukraine relations . " britain , hungary , poland and sweden support ukraine 's ambitions to join europe 's rich club but a number of the 27 current member states - including france and spain , with the " sympathy " of germany - are fiercely opposed . they believe that ties with ukraine should evolve under the framework of the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy , " offering countries near the bloc a privileged relationship rather than under its enlargement strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko -lrb- front -rrb- wants eu accession talks to begin those hostile to ukraine 's future membership believe it is vital not to " create confusion between the eu 's neighborhood policy and its enlargement strategy , " an eu diplomat said friday . but those in favor say there is no reason why ukraine could not shift from one policy area to the other , he said . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has pressed for accession talks to start next year but eu leaders said at the last eu-ukraine summit in october that the country has not undertaken enough reforms to be a contender . northern cyprus isolation the controversial issue of the divided island of cyprus was also on the agenda and eu nations agreed to work towards lifting the trade isolation of the island 's north " without delay . " work towards the adoption of " special conditions for trade " with the north " must resume without delay , " the ministers said at the meeting 's conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers want to establish " special conditions for trade " with the island 's north in 2004 , after the greek cypriots rejected reunification plans in a referendum , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to offer financial aid to the north of the island , which voted for reunification . a total of 259 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- in eu aid has been approved for northern cyprus where there are fewer than 200,000 people . while nicosia agreed to the aid , it has remained opposed to renewed trade with the north , as that could be seen as an implicit recognition of the breakaway north . however , last month , the greek cypriots agreed to sign up to a declaration engaging the eu to work towards resolving the problem . last month eu countries agreed to partially suspend turkey 's accession talks with the bloc in punishment for ankara 's refusal to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets deadline for turkey to open up its ports the eu believes that a solution to the turkish-cypriot dispute that threatens to derail membership talks for turkey to join the 25-member bloc is still possible with help from the united nations .

" the chancellor has a very close relationship with the foreign minister , which is based on trust , " said government spokesman thomas steg at a monday press conference .
" -lrb- she -rrb- goes on the assumption that the two will continue their successful work together . " steinmeier is being asked to explain his role in the prolonged detention of murat kurnaz in the us military prison in cuba .
kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years in there after his arrest as a suspected al qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the sept.11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . secret government documents circulating in the german media claim the us offered to release him in 2002 after concluding that he was not a terrorist , but that germany refused to take him back . the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung claimed steinmeier was actively involved in his role as coordinator of the country 's intelligence services under the then government of chancellor gerhard schröder . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 on the intervention of the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . committee investigation last week he appeared before a parliamentary panel investigating whether the country 's foreign intelligence service bnd breached german regulations while assisting us anti-terrorism operations after sept.11. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was questioned in front of the investigative committee in december steinmeier is scheduled to appear before the committee after kurnaz gives evidence again on feb .
1 and the agents who interrogated him at guantanamo are also questioned . both steg and foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said that the government could not comment on the allegations in detail because some of the documents involved are classified .
plötner said , however , that steinmeier was eager for the investigative committee to conclude its questioning of preliminary witnesses so that he would be able to " clear up the matter quickly . " kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday . " i 'm certain that when he addresses the panel he will be able to demonstrate that he acted without reproach , " he said . indignities the bearded kurnaz , 24 , described how he was subjected to physical and psychological abuse by his us captors that included being sprayed with " knock-out " gas and chained up for 12 hours a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz kurnaz 's account of the indignities he suffered during his time in guantanamo " got under my skin , " said max stadler , an opposition free democrat member of the parliamentary committee .

the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . " we have won as we had expected , " nikolic , the radicals ' candidate for prime minister , told afp .
pro-eu forces control majority but serbian president boris tadic said the polls were a breakthrough for pro-european union forces , which he urged to form a coalition government as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic would like to see his democratic party lead the new government " all parties supporting a pro-european stance won a majority and this is an important signal that serbia will send to europe and the world , " said tadic , the leader of the ds . tadic 's democrats are now being tipped to form a government with moderate nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and g17 plus . the three main groupings were followed by the reformist g17 plus party with 6.8 percent , milosevic 's socialist party of serbia with 5.9 percent and a neo-liberal alliance led by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- with 5.3 percent . " it 's necessary to form the government as soon as possible in order to start solving all problems that are awaiting us , " said tadic . nikolic , an outspoken critic of the un administration in kosovo , the european union and international war crimes trials against serbs , said he was " not convinced that we -lrb- the radicals -rrb- will be able to form the government . " he earlier ruled out forming a government with major opponents and warned moderate parties would " surrender " serbia 's sovereignty over kosovo .
kosovo remains critical issue sunday 's election came with serbia on the brink of losing kosovo , its historic heartland which has been run by the united nations since the end of the 1998-1999 war between serb forces and ethnic albanian guerrillas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic says the radical party would not " surrender " kosovo un envoy martti ahtisaari is expected to propose a form of independence for kosovo next week , which the international community hopes will resolve the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s . ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , are seeking independence , a demand staunchly opposed by serbia which is willing to consider only a form of broad autonomy . the un envoy delayed his long-awaited proposal until after the polls so as not to inflame nationalist sentiment in serbia at election time . asked by reporters whether he would accept kosovo 's independence , tadic said : " loud and clear , the answer is no . " and kostunica , a fervent opponent of kosovo 's independence , is expected to fight to hold on to his position , possibly in a bid to delay the formation of a coalition government and impact on the kosovo process .

" what 's more important is to have a consensus in the parliament ... especially when future status of kosovo is in question , " said kostunica . kosovo was a central theme of election campaigning ahead of a united nations decision next week on the future status of the breakaway province which has been run by a un mission since its 1998-1999 war . serbians voted for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?

this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?
chancellor angela merkel made an appeal this week for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy and questioned germany 's phase-out plans .

-lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

even though the holocaust was planned and executed by the nazi-regime in germany between 1936-1945 , the lessons of this crime against humanity , and the responsibility for not allowing such atrocities to happen again , is international .

" they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

" the chancellor has a very close relationship with the foreign minister , which is based on trust , " said government spokesman thomas steg at a monday press conference .
" -lrb- she -rrb- goes on the assumption that the two will continue their successful work together . " steinmeier is being asked to explain his role in the prolonged detention of murat kurnaz in the us military prison in cuba .
kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years in there after his arrest as a suspected al qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the sept.11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . secret government documents circulating in the german media claim the us offered to release him in 2002 after concluding that he was not a terrorist , but that germany refused to take him back . the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung claimed steinmeier was actively involved in his role as coordinator of the country 's intelligence services under the then government of chancellor gerhard schröder . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 on the intervention of the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . committee investigation last week he appeared before a parliamentary panel investigating whether the country 's foreign intelligence service bnd breached german regulations while assisting us anti-terrorism operations after sept.11. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier was questioned in front of the investigative committee in december steinmeier is scheduled to appear before the committee after kurnaz gives evidence again on feb .
1 and the agents who interrogated him at guantanamo are also questioned . both steg and foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said that the government could not comment on the allegations in detail because some of the documents involved are classified .
plötner said , however , that steinmeier was eager for the investigative committee to conclude its questioning of preliminary witnesses so that he would be able to " clear up the matter quickly . " kurt beck , the chairman of steinmeier 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , also came to the minister 's defense on sunday . " i 'm certain that when he addresses the panel he will be able to demonstrate that he acted without reproach , " he said . indignities the bearded kurnaz , 24 , described how he was subjected to physical and psychological abuse by his us captors that included being sprayed with " knock-out " gas and chained up for 12 hours a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz kurnaz 's account of the indignities he suffered during his time in guantanamo " got under my skin , " said max stadler , an opposition free democrat member of the parliamentary committee .
" it makes you really angry to learn that an innocent man was forced to spend five years in such conditions . " kurnaz also told the panel that he was interrogated on two occasions by german intelligence agents , who also concluded he was not a terrorist , the süddeutsche zeitung report said . plan to block return despite this evidence , german authorities actively blocked his release , the report said , quoting official documents which showed the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent his return . the documents obtained by the süddeutsche zeitung also suggested the intelligence services ask the americans to hand over kurnaz 's turkish passport to a german embassy so a page with his residence permit could be removed , leaving him without any chance of returning to the country . other media reports claimed the us attached conditions to kurnaz 's release , including one that he be placed under round-the-clock surveillance to make sure he did not engage in terrorism . " they were reluctant to be saddled with someone who did n't have german passport but a turkish one and who was so dangerous in the americans ' eyes that they felt he needed 24-hour observation , " an unnamed member of the spd involved in the case told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister under pressure in terror inquiry german foreign minister steinmeier faces uncomfortable questions over his role in the scandal surrounding a german-born former guantanamo inmate who has alleged he was abused by both german and us soldiers .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck beck stressed , however , that no act of clemency or presidential pardon would " retrospectively relativize the injustice of the acts or the pain of the victims .

" do not set my husband 's killer free , " waltrude schleyer told the daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
" i will never be able to forgive brigitte mohnhaupt .
to this day , she never apologized to me .

" she will not kill anybody , those times are over . " the former fanatical terrorist has become a calm , self-confident and helpful person , " he added .
" i can say that i do n't find her disagreeable at all . " mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected by the internet and only dimly remembers communism . the court is expected to reach a decision by mid-february . presidential pardon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar last week , german president horst köhler indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted along with mohnhaupt in 1985 for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . he has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?
chancellor angela merkel made an appeal this week for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy and questioned germany 's phase-out plans .

-lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

german coal miners face a bleak future germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses . once a cornerstone of german industry , the country 's depleted coal mining network 's bleak future became even more uncertain after a report revealed that the cots of german coal company deutsche steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- , a subsidiary of german mining group rag , had exceeded government subsidies by 163 million euros -lrb- $ 211 million -rrb- last year . the revelation in an article in der spiegel magazine quoted bernd tönjes , the head of dsk 's board of management , as saying that the industry 's gap between subsidy and profit was so severe that if it were not reduced by the end of the year - and if the german government did not increase the industry 's subsidies - one of the country 's last eight mines would be closed with the loss of at least 3,000 jobs . the dsk operates all the remaining mines in germany - seven in north rhine-westphalia and one in saarland - and employees 34,000 staff .
germany 's coal industry employs around 80,000 people in total . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's remaining mines are in danger of following their predecessors into extinction dsk parent company rag also spoke of the crisis on sunday saying that the longer the hole takes to be filled , the more mines and jobs will remain at risk .
" we are looking at the situation with great concern , " said rag spokesman christian kullmann in an interview with the associated press news agency .
" the consequences of this situation will be discussed as part of an extraordinary supervisory board meeting with the dsk . " according to der spiegel , the german government would have to increase its subsidies by a total of 2.5 billion euros in order to avoid job cuts until 2012 , when a final decision on the timeline for ending coal mining in germany could be reached . spd want to delay final decision chancellor angela merkel 's conservative political bloc has set 2018 as a deadline for ending the subsidies , but the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- members of her government do not agree with such a concrete date and want any final decision on future support for the industry to be delayed until 2012 .
the future of the coal industry is a particularly sensitive issue for the spd , whose political heartland is centered in the coal and industry belt of germany 's ruhr valley .
the spd has rejected completely shutting down the industry and wants to retain a core coal industry , which played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-world war ii economic " miracle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of subsidies would mean the end of many jobs ending state aid for the coal industry would have considerable social implications .
apart from the thousands of jobs dependent on coal mining , the drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future in germany comes against the backdrop of a growing dilemma in the nation about its overall energy needs .
this is particularly the case following berlin 's decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2021 .
coal industry 's demise adds to energy dilemma unlike the bruising battle with trade unions in britain in the 1980s over shutting a huge swathe of the country 's mines , over the last decade or more germany has pursued a more consensual approach to winding down the industry and retraining employees .
but the economics behind the german coal mining would not seem to be working in the industry 's favor .
while the price for a ton of coal on the world market is currently about 60 euros , the cost of wrenching one ton out of germany 's mines , which are carved into the deep earth , is about 190 euros a ton .
adding to the pressure to reach a decision over the coal industry 's future is the government 's plan to consolidate germany 's public finances to ensure the country 's budget deficit remains within the strict fiscal targets laid down for eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will relying on imported gas become too risky in future ?
in addition to the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy debate has also been shaped by last year 's surge in oil prices along with rising concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war .
this is especially the case following russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
what will fill the gap left by coal ? combined with this , the recent rise in german gas prices has alarmed consumers and as a result helped to make greater dependence on gas politically unacceptable in the nation as well as other parts of europe .
indeed , the question for germany 's political and business leaders as they grapple with the future of coal is what will replace the around 20 percent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the country has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade .
although generous government subsides might have also helped to turn germany into a world leader in the use of alternative energy sources , even officials in berlin remain skeptical as to whether renewable energy will have the potential to power the nation 's heavy industry in the near future . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should germany abandon nuclear phase-out plans ?

" more than two-thirds of the seats will go to the democratic forces , " steinmeier said on monday in brussels .
" as far as i can tell , this is a good basis for serbia to form a government that will put it on the european path . " the radical party claimed victory in serbian general elections on sunday after estimations put the formation in front , but conceded it had failed to get an outright majority and was unlikely to form a government . based on partial , unofficial results , the radical party had garnered 28.7 percent of votes .
the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . pro-european coalition expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's javier solana wants a reliable partner in serbia " i hope very much that there could be the formation of a government with pro-european and democratic forces , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday . " the majority from the elections is a majority which is for democratic forces , " solana said . as solana spoke , eu ambassadors were meeting to draw up a position on the polls for the ministers to debate over lunch . officials in brussels have said the bloc dearly wanted to see a moderate coalition emerge that is ready to cooperate with the un war crimes court , possibly leading to the unblocking of talks on closer ties . mounting problems but the strength of the serbian radical party - whose president vojislav seselj is awaiting trial at the un court - means it could take a long time to form a coalition , which could raise tensions in kosovo with its ethnic albanian majority increasingly impatient for independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo remains one of the biggest challenges facing the future serbian government " it 's up to the serbs what government they form , but i think their approach should be a european one , " said luxembourg 's foreign minister , jean asselborn . the eu froze a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with belgrade in may chiefly for its failure to surrender to the tribunal former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic , who was believed to be hiding in serbia . the accord is a first step for balkan states to join europe 's rich club , and serbia is desperate to enter the bloc and rebuild its economy " everyone knows what they have to do as far as the saa is concerned , but we will have to see , " asselborn said . " cooperation with the icty -lrb- international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -rrb- must be perfect , and you need a democratic government , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ultra-nationalists win serbian vote but pro-west coalition likely the ultra-nationalist radical party claimed victory in crucial serbian general elections on sunday , but conceded it had failed to get an outright majority and was unlikely to form a government .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .

it could mark the first step toward a transnational super union . the agreements , between the british union amicus , germany 's ig metall and two american unions , the united steel workers and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , are not quite blueprints for a merger , but they do mark a desire by unions to take a step in that direction , largely to keep up with corporations who no longer feel constrained by national borders . " the world is changing and the new global realities involve transnational companies being able to trade off countries and workforces against each other , " said derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , one of the uk 's largest , when the agreements were announced . " our aim is to create a powerful single union that can transcend borders to challenge the global forces of capital .
i envisage a functioning , if loosely federal , multinational trade union organization within the next decade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transnational union could make enough noise to get the attention of mulitnationals , advocates say the era of globalization has not been kind to trade unions .
as more corporations have moved parts of their operations to lower-wage countries , they have been able to demand wage concessions from unions .
even in germany , where the labor movement has traditionally been strong , unions have felt their power ebb and their membership rolls shrink as industrial jobs go abroad and the service sector grows . " trade unions in europe have lost ground in organizing new industries , the service sector and the growing economy , " said michael burda , a professor at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the labor movement .
" whereas in the united states , this was observed 20 to 25 years ago , it is just playing out in slow motion now in europe . " strategic retreat according to him , trade unions in most of europe are in a state of strategic retreat . in germany , real wages continued to rise for workers until the 1990s .
the result was that unions , in effect , priced themselves out of the global marketplace .
high labor costs made it very expensive to do business in germany .
companies simply began taking production to eastern europe or india or china , where wages are a fraction of what they are in germany . but over the past five to seven years , unions have agreed to wage concessions and either accepted small hikes or even wage freezes in collective bargaining rounds .
while painful for workers ' wallets , it has helped price german manufacturing back into the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has been critical of us " cowboy capitalists " still , that market has shrunk .
whereas around 28 percent of the german labor force worked in manufacturing 15 years ago , today that number is closer to 20 percent . " we have to admit , it has n't gotten any easier for unions , " said horst mund , head of international relations at ig metall , germany 's metalworkers union and one of the signers of the solidarity agreements with the american and british labor groups . " this is absolutely necessary when you see the scope of globalization .
companies are continually globalizing themselves , capital is mobile and employees have to face up to this challenge and work together internationally . " the next step while ig metall already has information-sharing agreements with foreign unions and has set up networks of employees at multinational corporations , the solidarity agreements take the cooperation one step further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a counterweight to global capital ?
" unions in germany need to know what 's going on at companies in great britain , for example , " mund said .
" we need to know what is being discussed about production locations , labor standards and other things , so we can address these issues with a united front . " while the head of amicus is calling for a super-union within a decade , mund would not put forward a time frame , saying only it is a long-term goal .
marco trbovich , a spokesman for the united steel workers , told britain 's cns news that his union also saw an official tie-up as something for the long term and that no discussions had been held yet . culture clashes there are stumbling blocks to any proposed transnational trade union merger , however hypothetical it may be at this point .
besides the obvious language differences , there are big differences in trade union cultures , the relationships between employers and employees , even the way wages are bargained for . " i 'm a bit skeptical , " said humboldt university 's burda .
" whereas a multinational can plop the same company down in many places , it 's very hard to establish a german-style trade union in italy , for example .
they 're so different that it 's incredibly difficult to imagine this happening anytime soon . " but , he added , the more power that is amassed on the side of the multinational corporation , the more likely it is that some countervailing power will arise on the labor side . ig metall 's mund agrees , saying that trade unions have little choice but to team up across borders if they want to stay relevant .
while teaming up internationally might be an unwelcome thorn in the multinationals ' side , the goal would not be to try to stop globalization or do as much harm as possible . " as an exporting nation , germany profits from globalization , " mund said .
" but we have to represent our employees ' interests , and this is likely going to be the way to do it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 22.01.2007 new docu-soap gives an insight into turkish-german families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life at home and at work is a drama for the özdags döner kebabs , mosques and arranged marriage - those are the common turkish stereotypes that germans have about the country 's largest minority .
but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .
however , he , for one , has got used to it .
his sister hülya agrees with him and credits the professional film team with putting the family at ease .
this , she believes , has made shooting the show very easy . an extraordinarily ordinary family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work and at play , the camera is always there author and director ute diehl wanted to make a show about an ordinary family which was extraordinary .
and when she was approached to portray a turkish family in the role , she was inspired immediately . " i still have the feeling that this is a very amusing world which we have not seen in its entirety yet , " says diehl .
" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .
the series provides a good opportunity to show people that many families live quite differently from them but not the way most think they do . silke schmidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love , lust and betrayal : german writers discover the small screen will ansgar stay with tanja and her baby ?

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .
however , he , for one , has got used to it .
his sister hülya agrees with him and credits the professional film team with putting the family at ease .

" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .

the center for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- said the radicals were followed by the pro-european democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- with 22.9 percent and the conservative democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- with 16.7 percent . " we have won as we had expected , " nikolic , the radicals ' candidate for prime minister , told afp .
pro-eu forces control majority but serbian president boris tadic said the polls were a breakthrough for pro-european union forces , which he urged to form a coalition government as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic would like to see his democratic party lead the new government " all parties supporting a pro-european stance won a majority and this is an important signal that serbia will send to europe and the world , " said tadic , the leader of the ds . tadic 's democrats are now being tipped to form a government with moderate nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and g17 plus . the three main groupings were followed by the reformist g17 plus party with 6.8 percent , milosevic 's socialist party of serbia with 5.9 percent and a neo-liberal alliance led by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- with 5.3 percent . " it 's necessary to form the government as soon as possible in order to start solving all problems that are awaiting us , " said tadic . nikolic , an outspoken critic of the un administration in kosovo , the european union and international war crimes trials against serbs , said he was " not convinced that we -lrb- the radicals -rrb- will be able to form the government . " he earlier ruled out forming a government with major opponents and warned moderate parties would " surrender " serbia 's sovereignty over kosovo .

but life often imitates art and vice versa as a new docu-soap shows . the experience of watching " the özdags " can be summed up with the description of just one scene : 34-year-old nebil sings with careless abandon to the german hits of the day .
this , in turn , brings huge embarrassment to his brother uzay who hopes that nobody is watching his sibling belt out bad german pop .
however , many will see it : the rest of the family as well as a whole nation . the stars of the new family series , mom and dad özdag , their seven children and four grandchildren , took a while to get used to the experience of being filmed . " this was completely new territory and at the beginning we were all very nervous , " says nebil .

" although the özdags have opened this world up to me in a way i would never have dared to hope . " diehl has followed the life of the mainly turkish family for one and a half years and has caught both private moments at home on camera as well as the experiences of everyday working life in the family firm , a turkish confectionary .
during this time , she has seen not only the cheerful and loving side of the family , but also the conflicts . hasan özdag is typical of those turks who came to germany 30 years ago to build a new life .
he worked hard and watched his children grow up in their adopted country , graduating from their professional training to join him working in the family company . tradition and modernity clash on screen but as a father with traditional values , he is not always happy with the way his children live .
traditional divisions of labor along gender lines do n't exist in germany as much as they do in turkey . thus , hasan is seen at one point in the show reacting angrily when his son-in-law does the vacuuming instead of repairing a broken bed . whatever happens in the özdag family , the television viewers are always present .
the youngest daughter , 26-year-old hülya , sees the show as a good way to correct mistaken stereotypes about turks in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 22.01.2007 should the eu make holocaust denial a crime ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's proposal provokes questions on freedom of speech german politicians recently said they want to make holocaust denial a crime across the eu during their country 's six-month term as head of the bloc .
the issue stirred many dw-world.de readers to share their thoughts . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . some people deny that jesus is the lord .
some say there is no such thing as global warming .
some say the holocaust did not happen .
making it a crime to have a different opinion is awful .
it seems to me that saying anything against jews is a crime already .
saying anything against hitler was a crime in those days .
are we going in that direction again ?
i am very disturbed , actually mad . - trudy miller , us the government has no right to tell people how to think . - richard spurgeon , us it is almost criminal to try to curtail and legislate the freedom of other people over a german-jewish confrontation that happened prior to the existence of the eu .
with this intent germany , is writing a sure ticket for sectarian violence in europe , to say the least .
one can not legislate history , but one can make sure that history does not repeat itself . - hans reuther-fix i am jewish .
some of my relatives were killed in 1941 in kiev .
it might surprise you that i am strongly against the proposed law .
i believe making holocaust denial a crime is potentially harmful and will make many people think that perhaps there is some truth to it if it is restricted .
i 've already heard some people say , " if it is the truth , how come it is forbidden to discuss it ? "
not to mention that it will put us , the jews , into a " special " category again , which is very undesirable .
instead , i suggest a broader law against presenting fabricated or fraudulent evidence on historic events .
this will be a fair and much more efficient filter against political extremists of all kinds .
and in the case of holocaust deniers -lrb- who usually use forged arguments -rrb- , it will not only get them punished , but also make sure they do n't have any followers . - vadim berman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can remembrance be reconciled with free speech ?
truth needs no laws to support it .
truth can withstand examination time and again .
throughout history , only lies and liars have resorted to the courts to enforce adherence to dogma . - michael davis in a free country , every person should have freedom of speech , no matter how senseless their opinions are , including freedom of religion . - else buegge-wood jesus-denial was a crime in the 15th century , so holocaust denial can be a crime in 21st century .
after all , every faith persecutes its heretics . - kazimierz a total rejection of the holocaust should be made a crime in the eu , because it is part of european history in a broad sense .
even though the holocaust was planned and executed by the nazi-regime in germany between 1936-1945 , the lessons of this crime against humanity , and the responsibility for not allowing such atrocities to happen again , is international .
by making a denial of the holocaust a crime , we also give the victims of the holocaust the sole control over their own painful memories , and history .
they will have the final say on the crime committed against them . - jansen compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? -lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- convicted holocaust denier irving expelled from austria convicted british holocaust denier david irving arrived in britain after austria expelled him and banned him from ever returning .
-lrb- 22.12.2006 -rrb- germany protests against tehran holocaust conference german lawmakers have protested against an iranian conference on the holocaust .
the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis .

it can be a very stressful business .
but a german man threw caution to the wind and took his wife out for a quiet lesson .
or that 's what he thought . when learning to drive , it 's often safest for all those involved to take those first tentative steps towards auto proficiency on a quiet little stretch of road .
there , the inexperienced driver can toddle along at a snail 's pace without infuriating the other road users or putting anyone 's life at risk . this was surely the intention of the caring husband who decided to ease his young bride into the driver 's seat with a leisurely lesson on a deserted stretch of asphalt . unfortunately , while hubby obviously had his beloved 's best interests at heart , he had n't thought the whole thing through .
which is why the inexperienced young lady found herself on one of germany 's fasted race tracks on the saturday afternoon when it is given over to speeding lunatics . wrongly thinking the nürburgring would be a model of solitude and safety on a weekend when there was no scheduled formula one , touring car or superbike race , the 31-year-old man inadvertently introduced his nervous spouse to the thrills and spills of high-speed circuit driving . wrong time , wrong place , wrong direction if the fact that they had turned up on the day that private drivers were allowed to take their souped-up bmw 's and mercedes ' out on the track was n't bad enough , the small matter of taking to the ring in the wrong direction only made matters worse . after avoiding speeding vehicles whizzing towards her at more than 100 kilometers per hour , the driver and her husband were accosted by local police who , after finding that the wife had no license , promptly gave them a ticket . assuming the fine , the possibility of a ban and the near-death experience does n't completely ruin her confidence , the 20-year-old learner will certainly have a tale to tell the driving instructor when she begins official lessons .
that is , if she can stop shaking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racing porsche mistaken for landing strip a member of a private german racing club had the shock of his life when a single-seater plane swooped out of the sky and landed on the roof of his speeding vehicle on wednesday .

mr fakhruddin ahmed also promised to hold elections " as soon as possible " .
earlier this month , president iajuddin ahmed quit as interim leader and postponed the 22 january vote , saying it was " not possible " to hold it .
the moves followed months of violent protests amid claims by a political alliance that the vote is being rigged .
across the country the violence left more than 40 people dead .
a state of emergency was also declared in the country before mr ahmed took office over a week ago .
in his first television address to the nation on sunday , mr ahmed said : " my administration is pledge-bound to hold the new elections within the shortest possible time .
our motto is to hold a free , fair and participatory election . "
he blamed corruption for much of what has gone so wrong in bangladesh .
mr ahmed said the army and the police would continue to arrest corrupt individuals , while upholding human rights .
the bbc 's john sudworth in dhaka says many people in bangladesh believe that the country has been pulled back from the brink of anarchy by the declaration of the state of emergency , the cancellation of elections and appointment of the new interim government headed by mr ahmed .
the awami league party described the decision to postpone the elections as a " victory for the people " .
the awami league has long alleged electoral bias in favour of its bitter rival , the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- .
the bnp rejected the allegations and had said it would take part in the vote .

mr fakhruddin ahmed also promised to hold elections " as soon as possible " .
earlier this month , president iajuddin ahmed quit as interim leader and postponed the 22 january vote , saying it was " not possible " to hold it .
the moves followed months of violent protests amid claims by a political alliance that the vote is being rigged .
across the country the violence left more than 40 people dead .
a state of emergency was also declared in the country before mr ahmed took office over a week ago .
in his first television address to the nation on sunday , mr ahmed said : " my administration is pledge-bound to hold the new elections within the shortest possible time .
our motto is to hold a free , fair and participatory election . "
he blamed corruption for much of what has gone so wrong in bangladesh .
mr ahmed said the army and the police would continue to arrest corrupt individuals , while upholding human rights .
the bbc 's john sudworth in dhaka says many people in bangladesh believe that the country has been pulled back from the brink of anarchy by the declaration of the state of emergency , the cancellation of elections and appointment of the new interim government headed by mr ahmed .
the awami league party described the decision to postpone the elections as a " victory for the people " .
the awami league has long alleged electoral bias in favour of its bitter rival , the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- .
the bnp rejected the allegations and had said it would take part in the vote .

the police suspect the attacks are the work of the united liberation front of assam -lrb- ulfa -rrb- .
seventy hindi speaking migrants were killed in a week of attacks in northern assam at the beginning of january .
ulfa is fighting one of india 's longest running insurgencies to establish an independent homeland in assam .
the rebels say india 's central government exploits the state 's rich resources such as tea and natural gas and does little for its people who are ethnically closer to burma and china than to india .
a police spokesman said a powerful explosion late on sunday near a crowded vegetable market in barpeta district killed a cobbler and injured five other people - one of whom died later .
earlier two people were wounded when a bomb exploded outside a railway station in the state .

two other parties have won substantial shares of the vote .
the bbc 's john mcmanus spoke to bozidar djelic , candidate for prime minister of the pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- .
how has the democratic party done ?
the democratic party has done splendidly .
it is a record for any pro-europe and pro-democracy party here in serbia .
we have a lot of reasons to be satisfied .
above all the dp sees itself as having a role in state-building .
this election focused on civil ideas such as tax , which is a real improvement for serbia .
the media will focus on the serbian radical party , but those results were n't progressive .
if you become the next prime minister , what kind of relations will your party have with europe ?
we have been the bridge between europe and serbia , people see us as that party , and it explains our results .
we aim to restart the stabilisation and association process within three months of coming to power .
then we want to achieve the status of candidate country to join the eu within one year , and then achieve the schengen agreement in the second year .
we know europeans are concerned about unwanted migration , and we 'll work very hard to ensure this is n't a jump into the unknown .
a decision is due soon on kosovo .
how will you react to western demands that it become independent ?
there is a natural consensus that kosovo should have as much autonomy as possible within serbia .
with such a delicate issue it is best to wait for the new government to be formed and then we will be able to discuss this properly .
any unilateral or imposed solution in this interim period will only play into the hands of the nationalists , and encourage them to have a repeat election .
it will give them a platform that they have been denied in this election .
and if the un and eu still insist on kosovo 's independence ?
let us negotiate .
we do not intend to blackmail the international community and neither should the people in pristina .

mr clarke paved the way as the first uk children 's commissioner when he was appointed in march 2001 .
first minister rhodri morgan described mr clarke as a champion for children who fulfilled his duties with passion , dedication and commitment .
welsh secretary peter hain said peter clarke was " never afraid to stand up and be counted " in his children 's role .
mr clarke was appointed wales ' children 's commissioner on st david 's day in 2001 partly in response to the waterhouse inquiry into abuse in children 's home in north wales .
during his years in office he spoke out on issues ranging from bullying , to smacking , to the welfare of children in care .
remembrance board however , mr clarke is probably best known for his controversial decision to hold an inquiry into the serial sexual abuse carried out by former drama teacher john owen on children at a school in pontypridd .
in a statement , his office said mr clarke passed away with his wife jenny and two sons at his side .
acting commissioner maria battle said : " it will be no surprise to know that , up until the end , his thoughts were of the children and young people of wales . "
an online " remembrance board " is planned by the commissioner 's office .
ms battle said mr clarke had worked " tirelessly to improve the lives of our children and young people " .
" we all took strength from the tremendous courage that peter showed in the face of his illness and from his continued determination to speak up for wales ' children and young people .
" he has inspired his staff to take his vision forward . "
first minister rhodri morgan said mr clarke had " blazed a trail for others to follow " .
he said : " he made an enormous contribution to the lives of children and young people in wales in the past six years and many thousands have benefited , and will benefit in the future , from his work . "
peter hain said : " it is a credit to peter 's commitment and success that england , scotland and northern ireland have all followed the welsh lead to establish similar children 's commissioner roles . "
children 's minister jane hutt appointed mr clarke to the commissioner 's post and said he became a " a significant and authoritative voice " for children and young people .
' fearless ' education , lifelong and skills minister jane davidson said mr clarke " will be an extremely hard act to follow " .
she said : " i particularly pay tribute to him for his determination in ensuring that children 's voices are heard loudly and clearly by policy makers and that all those of us who hold positions of authority should do all we can to improve services to children , particularly the most vulnerable . "
tributes have also come from opposition parties plaid cymru described mr clarke as " a fearless champion of children 's rights " who " made a great success of his post " .
" he was ready to challenge all the old assumptions and made sure children 's voices were heard even when that made difficult hearing for those in power . "
for the liberal democrats , peter black am said mr clarke " was a persistent fighter whose campaigns on behalf of young people have helped to set the agenda in wales for many years to come " .
welsh conservatives ' health and social services spokesman jonathan morgan am said mr clarke " will be a hard act to follow " .
" his focus on social care , mental health issues and advocacy gave the assembly the expert and independent viewpoint which we needed , " he said .
england 's children 's commissioner sir albert aynsley-green also paid tribute to mr clarke , saying how he had offered him guidance and support and it was a " privilege to have had the opportunity to work with him " .

mr clarke paved the way as the first uk children 's commissioner when he was appointed in march 2001 .
first minister rhodri morgan described mr clarke as a champion for children who fulfilled his duties with passion , dedication and commitment .
welsh secretary peter hain said peter clarke was " never afraid to stand up and be counted " in his children 's role .
mr clarke was appointed wales ' children 's commissioner on st david 's day in 2001 partly in response to the waterhouse inquiry into abuse in children 's home in north wales .
during his years in office he spoke out on issues ranging from bullying , to smacking , to the welfare of children in care .
remembrance board however , mr clarke is probably best known for his controversial decision to hold an inquiry into the serial sexual abuse carried out by former drama teacher john owen on children at a school in pontypridd .
in a statement , his office said mr clarke passed away with his wife jenny and two sons at his side .
acting commissioner maria battle said : " it will be no surprise to know that , up until the end , his thoughts were of the children and young people of wales . "
an online " remembrance board " is planned by the commissioner 's office .
ms battle said mr clarke had worked " tirelessly to improve the lives of our children and young people " .
" we all took strength from the tremendous courage that peter showed in the face of his illness and from his continued determination to speak up for wales ' children and young people .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- big brother row points to mature india bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 22 january 2007 , 07:28 gmt big brother row points to mature india by paul danahar bbc south asia bureau editor white english people are ignorant stupid racists .
it 's a sweeping , inaccurate generalisation but it 's the impression that might have been left in the minds of millions of people in india who last week watched one of their own being , to use the english vernacular , " slagged off " mercilessly on british tv .
contrary to much of the reporting around the world shilpa shetty is not a major bollywood star .
if she was she would not have shared a stage with the british b-grade celebrities also stuck inside the big brother house .
the programme makers would n't have been able to afford her pay cheque .
but while she may not have been the darling of the big screen in india before she entered the reality show , she 'll emerge , regardless of the means of her exit as a darling of the indian middle class .
onslaught there has been a palpable sense of pride with the way she has dealt with what is widely seen here as racist , foul-mouthed onslaughts from her clearly under-educated , boorish english companions . "
ms goody articulates in all her crassness the fact that your average english speaking indian is a lot better educated than your average english person " but more interestingly the incident has also shown that india , contrary to the fears of british diplomats , has become comfortable enough with its position in the world to see things like the big brother row in perspective .
the indian media has had a feeding frenzy on this story .
it 's dominated the headlines and been wall-to-wall across the dozens of new tv news channels that have sprung up over the last few years .
what there has n't been is a knee jerk xenophobia against the british , in response to an indian woman being abused by descendants of the old raj .
for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface .
given an opportunity indian leaders would fall over themselves to take a dig at the british for an easy bit of popular press .
the best example of this was when the then prime minister ik gujral publicly called the uk a " third rate " country in petulant response to a perceived slight from the british entourage out for the 50th anniversary of india 's independence .
future greatness i 'm sure that if the big brother controversy had been played out then , the reaction of the indian media would have been much more akin to the kind of aggressive nationalism displayed by the british tabloids against the french .
but as india this year prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary of independent rule one thing seems to be clear .
india has stopped looking over its shoulder .
it no longer views itself through the prism of its colonial past .
the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have .
india no longer feels the need to dwell on past injustices because it 's too busy getting ready for what many predict will be its future greatness .
there has been outrage here at the treatment of shilpa shetty .
but there has also been acknowledgement that there has been equal outrage in the uk from brown , black and white people alike .
the condemnation by britain 's political class from the prime minister down has received the same attention as the comments from the indian government .
the only exception to this measured response were the half dozen chaps in bihar who found their 15 minutes of fame by burning a rather bad effigy of the channel four executives .
but no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis , which was recycled endlessly on tv around the world , represents the rest of the nation .
so despite the shrill cry from the british media , there was never any chance that this was going to become a diplomatic incident during the visit of britain 's finance minister , gordon brown .
his entourage were probably having kittens when the media started asking him about this story but the reality is that today 's indian leadership is much more interested in solidifying its place in the international pecking order than scoring cheap points off the likely next british prime minister .
better educated one english commentator noted after the row erupted that " shilpa shetty has taken the supposed british virtues of civility , articulacy , reserve and having a stiff upper lip and shown that .. we lack them " .
that 's not all india does better than the uk these days .
in terms of their celebrity status shilpa and her nemesis jade goody are almost on a par .
but taken as a snap shot of like-for-like india 's b-grade celebrities are clearly better educated , better mannered and frankly speak better english than their uk counterparts .
unfortunately for the uk it 's not just indian celebrities .
british companies have been outsourcing their customer service centres , software departments , biotechnology labs etc to the subcontinent for years now .
they did so because they recognised a huge pool of well-educated , english-speaking , middle-class people that could do the job not only cheaper than the folks back home , but often better .
jade goody clearly believed that her behaviour would be tolerated by the british public watching outside .
she was wrong .
ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
her antics also over-shadowed mr brown 's trip here .
but long term she may have helped mr brown make a fairly important point to the british public .
gordon brown had never set foot in india before last week .
but he already knew the challenges its huge pool of young people posed to the uk economy .
he outlined the challenges in his annual economic review late last year .
ms goody articulates in her crassness the fact that your average english-speaking indian -lrb- most of whom have been through private schooling -rrb- is a lot better educated than your average english person .
and by the way there are probably more than 100 million of them .
if you 're british then shilpa shetty in all her well-mannered educated politeness is a lot more scary that jade goody could ever hope to be .
if you would like to send a comment about this story you can use the form below .
here is a selection of your comments so far .
what i find mind-boggling is that a woman like jade goody who has accomplished absolutely nothing in her life can be made a " celebrity " by the british people .
this , while multitudes of good , honest and hard-working britons struggle to make end meet .
what does this say about the kind of trashy society that great britain has become ? ?
chris alam , usa what has the world come to ?
so much commotion over tv series , when so much hunger , poverty , religious discord and health issues are yet to be dealt with .
zoe rebelo , tanzania , e africa it is completely unrealistic to say that all call centres etc have been outsourced to india due to the fact that indians have a better standard of middle class , well educated people .
you have only to ask someone and they complain about the appalling level of english language that many have heard when calling these call centres .
i believe jade 's comments to have been blown out of proportion , and , writing this from australia where i currently live , find it absurd that it is hitting headlines here as well .
this has only highlighted the fact to me that the media is somewhat farcical , and is prepared to report on anything to provoke a reaction .
the fact that this is being more widely reported than say , poverty in africa , is just ridiculous .
anna palmer , uk mr danahar 's views are typically orientalist , using journalism for venting out his repressed racism / upper class arrogance .
two examples are stark : 1 . " the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have " .
does he mean to say that india 's anti-colonialism was due to inferiority complex ? 2 .
" no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis " .
being south asia bureau editor , mr danahar knows what do such remarks connote .
it only shows how he shares the indian upper class arrogance , degrading not only biharis , but all poor people who are collectively called biharis in a derogatory manner .
kumarila , maryland -lrb- usa -rrb- excellent paul !
you have just about summed up everything that i would have wanted to say .
sateesh , canada very good article , and thanks for pointing out the fact that shilpa is in fact a b-grade actress .
and those few idiots in bihar -lrb- india 's most lawless state -rrb- who were burning all those effigies really gave a wrong impression of how we feel about the whole issue .
i would give the british a lot more credit for the way they handled the whole issue .
although a lot of them feel the comments made by jade goody were n't racist , they overwhelmingly disproved her behaviour on the show .
if this had happened in america , rest assured shilpa shetty would have been voted out of show for using the ' race card ' .
after staying in both countries , i have to say that the british are far more tolerant than americans .
so paul , do n't be too hard on your countrymen .
prem patel , india at the end of the day , the " incident " demonstrates the enduring , growing and changing relationship between britain and india .
it also demonstrated that boorish conduct will be denounced by indians and british alike who share similar values .
anthony , canada while the author so succinctly claims that " for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface " , he forgets that india is still a relatively newly independent country , bound to suffer from the ramifications of its very recent experiences with colonial rule .
hence , a few more decades might be needed to erase completely the bitter taste of this experience and for india to get over it .
the author would like the memory of the collective indian psyche to be very short .
alas , it does not work this way .
itishree trivedi , usa the big brother incident has brought out of the closet the hidden racism that underlies british society .
the great country of britain now needs to now correct itself before trying to solve world problems , as in iraq , afghanistan , africa etc .
britain should also stop beating on other countries for so called " human rights " violations .
dave , usa i was visiting england and saw the shows in question .
sure , jade was not so refined , but what strikes me in all this is that there 's about zero mention of the fact that shilpa was monumentally arrogant , condescending and dishonest .
when jade noted these things - in rather indelicate terms - shilpa did not address those issues , but chose to attack the way those issues were addressed ... which as anyone might expect , is only going to make anyone that much more displeased .
this " ooooh , poor shilpa " is nonsense and a foolish response to media hype in england and in india .
bob hough , usa the piece is absolute nonsense - the occupants of the big brother house are in no way a reflection of the citizens of this country -lrb- thank god -rrb- , and in attempting to draw conclusions on the relative national character of contemporary india and britain from it 's frankly weak stock , the author is doing nothing more than clutching at straws , showing himself to have been sucked in and brainwashed by a programme that is an insult to broadcasting and free thought .
institutions like the bbc have a duty not to allow programmes of big brother 's quality to prevail , and taking them seriously like this author does is tantamount to appeasement .
sensationalist articles such as this one , and the massive generalisations they make based on nothing but the most tenuous of premises , are as dangerous and irresponsible as giving the microphone to jade goody in the first place and allowing her to represent britain .
alex , uk india is maturing from its colonial past to a new era of its true identity of a conscious nation .
a. bose , us i am astounded at the fuss being made of this so called racism .
i am a uk citizen living in canada and when i went to india four years ago i was the brunt of a lot of racism by the indian citizens .
the expression of " you can dish it out but can not take it " comes to mind .
i did not ever comment on the remarks about me that i heard whilst in india i just chose to ignore them .
i then decided not to put my manufacturing plant there which cost several hundred people jobs .
there is racism in every culture and the people that are the most racist are the ones that criticise any racism directed toward them .
terrie trevillion , canada how dare you insult myself and my fellow british people with your inane , racist drivel .
firstly , shilpa has acted like a rude , selfish snob .
regularly telling people to , " shut up " if anything they said was n't to her liking or did n't tally with her wishes .
she even slapped cleo during one such incident .
not exactly the actions of a dignified lady .
there were numerous displays of selfishness , not least the shopping list that she took complete control of , denying jade a mere 500g of minced beef , whilst she ordered 10 chickens , roughly 30 to 40 times the financial expense of jade 's meagre request .
then she had the audacity to complain and lie about the stock cubes .
as for your claims that she 's articulate , " learn your vocabularies , learn your dictionaries " is n't the finest use of the english language i 've ever heard .
jonathan brooke lyons , uk by the way , has anyone pointed out that jade goody is actually mixed race herself ? ! ?
marcus , uk come on folks .. get a life !
two people clashed so what ?
monica quince , belgium i am married to a hindu man and have two lovely children and very much enjoy the indian culture .
i was appalled seeing big brother and i feel goody is just an ignorant foul mouthed bully .
my husband watches this more than me and he just saw it as bullying rather than true racism but everyone thinks differently in this subject - my eight-year-old son thought she was racist and a bully .
michelle pandit , england channel 4 should pay for ms goody to attend classes in cultural sensitivity .
big brother producers should be required to attend .
ms goody should volunteer to perform charitable work in india , preferably in bihar where effigies of channel 4 executives were burned .
ms shetty should agree to supervise ms goody 's work and be responsible for ms goody 's security and well being while in india .
ms. goody to bear all expenses and pay ms shetty for services rendered from the proceeds of her inevitable forthcoming " tell-all " book .
shashi rattan , usa even though with changing economy , invasion of television , greed for material and millions of problems - hopefully indians will not loose tolerance .
sanjiv patel , usa jade goody does n't represent the majority of britons , she does n't even represent celebrity in this country .
she represents a pathetic shameful but minority subculture of britain , and trust me .
the problem is in this country is that the silent majority are too often neglected , nobody cares about the intelligent modest people who run this country .
steve , uk mr danahar is not off the mark for the better part of his analysis , but sticking up for the likes of ms shetty is well , a bit too much .
no one forced these publicity-hungry has-been celebrities on these tv shows .
come on sir , india and britain have better things to do than pandering to the contrived sensibilities of the likes of ms shetty .
jaganniwas iyer , india i 'm british born , but i have never heard of jade goody .
come to that , i 've never heard of shilpa shetty either , but on my pc she looks a lot more attractive !
alan conroy , spain india and china will rule the world in the next 50 years .
raman chauhan , canada i wish the average person in the us could read this story and see what part he or she represents therein .
however , and i am sad to say this , my nation is full of denial , long and short term memory loss , and an over inflated sense of self .
this country is overpopulated by the likes of ms goody , and could stand to learn quite a bit from ms shetty .
thank you for the insight and yes , the us should be afraid as well .
joy garscadden , us it was a clash of culture , and jade 's is certainly the dominant culture of celebrity in this country at the moment .
pieter gerits , uk jade goody 's racism should be condemned .
mr danahar 's article , however , moves far beyond that topic , for a general " india 's better than britain " swipe .
of course , india has a huge , highly educated workforce .
and india is destined to be one of the most powerful economies -lrb- and rightly so ! -rrb- , but i sense here that such a reality is being used for an angry put down to a readership who , by default , are probably a lot more educated and open minded than jade goody .
thanks for the warning that brits should be scared , mr danahar .
is n't there a word for that kind of talk ?
i remember when the bbc was dispassionate !
tom dibble , united states let me understand this : shilpa shetty is a beautiful , articulate , poised and highly educated young lady , and we are supposed to be scared of her ?
attracted , in-love and gaga about her , definitely , but never ever scared !
jefferson , england i suggest that shilpa shetty had planned her protestations before she even entered the programme .
tony smith , spain shilpa , i think you have handled the situation well .
there is no point of arguing with a person who fails to give respect to others , or a nation .
dhruba chakravarty , australia what a frank , realistic view !
having in lived in britain for two years , i can not help admitting most of the above is true .
remus negoita , france i take no issue with paul danahar 's argument regarding the new indian middle class .
i would like to say , however , that he is callous in his remarks regarding postcolonial indian attitudes towards the british raj .
resentment over 200-plus years of imperial subjugation should not be so dismissively referred to as a " chip on the shoulder " and " knee jerk xenophobia . "
surely there is more to it than a mere attitude problem , and 60 years may not be quite enough time to " get over " two centuries of foreign rule .
moreover , loss of faraway colonies is far easier to accept and attain closure over , than a bloodbath in the wake of , and partly due to , an ill-planned imperial departure .
burney , boston , usa it is appalling how much jade is being bullied now and to see how people from a country -lrb- namely india -rrb- which itself is so racist , where religious violence occurs , where homosexuals , women and children are get horrific treatment- sometimes even at the hands of government officials , a country where caste system originated and inter-community prejudice is widespread has the gall to talk about tolerance !
clean up your own backyard first !
vic friman , sweden why is this news ?
mark , the netherlands as mr danahar writes , there might be in india 100 million of english speaking , well educated people , perhaps even better educated than their british pairs .
however , it is not to be forgotten that india has a fast growing population of 1 billion people .
so the well-educated middle-class only stands for less than 10 % of the total population .
the other 90 % are illiterate and appallingly poor , and most of them would probably kill in order to live in britain .
f. portillo , spain we curse and call our fellow citizens , always have , always will , it 's a british thing , however appalling , but nothing more becomes of it .
as soon as any kind of comment is made to , or about , a member of another country or religion , the whole thing is blown out of all proportion .
in order to intermingle with other races , the word racism wants obliterating altogether from the english language so that we can all get on with out lives .
carol , uk this incident reflects poorly upon britain 's image as the media and society seems to be building third class role models .
maybe time once again to focus on good , clean ' british ' values and throw out the trash ?
robin bhowmik , reading , uk the decline of one nation and the rise of another are manifest .
charles hazell , uk would someone please tell me why we are wasting so much time and energy on what is little more than a second rate show with second rate " celebrities " ?
carol , uk big brother is a very popular show and guess a very good platform for shilpa to highlight the indian values and traditions .
what is the harm in doing so ?
after all , most of the people only know india as being a rural nation of snake-charmers .
priya , canada in india you easily get publicity by courting controversies .
the media are waiting to pounce on any such trivial controversies .
but i really doubt whether shilpa 's career would be resurrected after this ugly incident .
raj singh , united states we can not think that jade goody , good and bad , represents all of england .
she does n't even represent all of her neighbourhood .
i understand some of the feelings associated with this incident , but to think that england is essentially retreating into social cannibalism is plain dumb .
lets keep some perspective .
van martin , london , england jane goody would not exist if we did not create her and now we are upset with what we created .
big brother is a shameful programme anyway but its the sort of rubbish most of us seem to demand .
of course we ought to scared of shilpa shetty but our only consolation should be that educated and polite people like her would be too disgusted to want to live in britain anyway .
adrian baron , kinsgtown , st. vincent and the grenadines i disapprove heartily of the way jade is reported to have behaved in the house , but i would stop short of drawing conclusions about british society from it , much as i would stop short of drawing conclusions about india from the ludicrous effigy burning scenes we witnessed .
tris , uk in recognition of the distinctly british attitude and values shilpa showed when tolerating ms goody and co 's abuse , why do n't we award her an honorary british citizenship ?
it would definitely help repair the damage to our international reputation abroad and set a benchmark for us back at home !
piers register , united kingdom i believe that the vast majority of the british people are civilised and decent , and their reaction to this incident confirms that .
but we should not be in denial about racist and such discriminatory attitudes existing in our societies -lrb- including in india -rrb- , and should do what is necessary to combat them .
that would be especially important in our increasingly multi-ethnic societies .
padma , india i had lived in watford for the past fourteen months and had seen the reality show .
there is no need for shilpa or for that matter any indian to feel offended as this is a show wherein each contestant tries to bully the other .
if shilpa felt offended she should have walked out of the show and if goody really meant what she meant , she was just ill informed .
the media also did not have better story to cover and they are highlighting an irrelevant issue .
shiva subramanya , india i agree with mr danahar about the indian reaction but the parallels between ms goody and shilpa shetty are few and far between .
ms goody represents the worst of modern britain whereas ms shetty represents something of the best that modern india has to offer .
we should remember that no nation is perfect .
if ms goody 's so called career is now at end however , britain will have taken a step in that direction .
pankaj , uk while ms goody 's comments are deplorable , she has expressed sincere -lrb- i hope -rrb- regrets in the course of her interview .
maybe it is time everybody put this behind them and look forward .
chandra ram , india the producers carefully crafted this conflict .
make no mistake , the black gentleman on the show is well educated and mannered too , but the white participants seem to have been rounded up at a local pub .
the demographic on the show is not representational , or fair , it is just constructed to incite .
i 've travelled to india and it is one of the " best read " nations in the world , but not everyone is well mannered and well read in india either .
if you put an uneducated indian on the show , they would potentially make ignorant statements as well .
maybe ms goody could n't afford private schooling as the " average " english speaking indian can .
i am curious from which source mr. danahar quotes this fact .
brett , japan i realised a long time ago , that when a person is insecure or does n't like herself , then instead of trying to be a better person , it is easier to bring others down to her level .
vashti bowlah , trinidad , west indies sure , britain is a long way from eradicating racism but no one should get any praise out of this entire episode .
sympathy for shilpa , may be .
abhijit rajan , india -lrb- resident of us -rrb- i do n't believe british people have anything to find scary about a large pool of possible immigrants who are well educated , speak english and have a desire to succeed .
coming from canada a country that has more than 20 % of its population foreign born i can say that immigrants contribute their fair share to society .
justin acton , edinburgh uk while there may be some individuals who are racist in britain , it 's not the institutionalised racism that exists in india .
steve , usa shilpa shetty is not a b-grade actress .
only she is n't the top most one .
i do n't think jade goody 's celebrity stature ever matched shilpa shetty 's .
shilpa shetty is a ' star ' , much more than what this article suggests .
anurag , india jade goody and shilpa shetty are a class apart in more ways than one .
mamta srivastava , canada a well written article .
paul danahar has understood india better and its people even better .
today 's india is poised for growth and development .
such acts will be seen as a non-issue but there are many in india who still feel britain is a racist society and this has added fuel to it .
paul belson , india superbly said , i could not agree more .
what jade highlighted in her diatribes last week was the presence , on every corner of our once sacred green land of shakespeare , chaucer , brunel and churchill , of an increasingly ignorant , spoilt , junk-food eating , anti-social , booze-worshipping , mtv ipod generation of young people that do not know the meaning of a hard day 's work .
since the uk lost all its heavy industry in the 80s the offspring of the working class has turned into an underclass .
ironically it takes something so representative of this useless generation - big brother , for us to realise this .
richard loach , canada finally , a balanced comment on modern british ignorance .
i do n't mean the allegedly -lrb- or perhaps actually -rrb- racist remarks - i did not follow the big brother story , because big brother is rubbish .
i mean mr danahar 's pointed comment that ' your average english-speaking indian ... is a lot better educated than your average english person ' .
sadly , my experience tends rather to support this claim .
many of the younger -lrb- and not-so-young -rrb- generation in britain seem to think ignorance a virtue , and boorishness a substitute for thought .
let 's hope that this ' many ' is in fact a minority , but i have my doubts .
d fear , germany i currently run a project scaling up an india supplier .
they have etiquette and expertise .
technically they are educated to a better standard , higher motivation and a strong willingness to learn .
i worry for the uk as the standard of graduate is generally poor .
inability to spell , add up or tackle difficult tasks are evidence of the successive failings of our pass rate driven education system .
the manners and etiquette ?
liberalisation of society has handed rights to child and handcuffed the teacher .
rights may well be fundamental but they also need maturity and intelligence to be exercised responsibly .
gareth knowling , uk considering the state of moral and cultural decay of our european societies , it is not unlikely that within 10 or 20 years we shall be polishing the shoes of our indians and chinese masters .
i am inclined to think that we shall deserve it .
jean-bernard brisset , france india does n't have a chip on its shoulder ? ?
carl , nottingham , uk shilpa may be a b class actor but she handled herself like an first class human being .
dorothy green , us jade goody represents everything that is wrong with this country .
she is a cringe worthy example of someone in the public eye that sends out wrong messages to many young people here and abroad .
her lack of education and culture does nothing to our country 's image .
ann k , uk sorry for being a pain but i was annoyed by some inaccuracies in this article .
just thought that you might like to know that shilpa shetty is a critically acclaimed actress and if you would look at the list of the top indian actresses you would probably put her fifth on this .
i am no ' fan boy ' but she is definitely not on anything other than the a-list in terms of celebrity status in india .
therefore , saying that she is an indian b-grade celebrity is not nice , rather just insulting looking at her talent and dignity in bad situations , and you just can not compare her to jade goody in any way .
all i ask is that you research on your subject before writing , please !

it 's a sweeping , inaccurate generalisation but it 's the impression that might have been left in the minds of millions of people in india who last week watched one of their own being , to use the english vernacular , " slagged off " mercilessly on british tv .
contrary to much of the reporting around the world shilpa shetty is not a major bollywood star .
if she was she would not have shared a stage with the british b-grade celebrities also stuck inside the big brother house .
the programme makers would n't have been able to afford her pay cheque .
but while she may not have been the darling of the big screen in india before she entered the reality show , she 'll emerge , regardless of the means of her exit as a darling of the indian middle class .
onslaught there has been a palpable sense of pride with the way she has dealt with what is widely seen here as racist , foul-mouthed onslaughts from her clearly under-educated , boorish english companions .
ms goody articulates in all her crassness the fact that your average english speaking indian is a lot better educated than your average english person send your comments but more interestingly the incident has also shown that india , contrary to the fears of british diplomats , has become comfortable enough with its position in the world to see things like the big brother row in perspective .
the indian media has had a feeding frenzy on this story .
it 's dominated the headlines and been wall-to-wall across the dozens of new tv news channels that have sprung up over the last few years .
what there has n't been is a knee jerk xenophobia against the british , in response to an indian woman being abused by descendants of the old raj .
shetty 's treatment sparked protests in india last week for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface .
given an opportunity indian leaders would fall over themselves to take a dig at the british for an easy bit of popular press .
the best example of this was when the then prime minister ik gujral publicly called the uk a " third rate " country in petulant response to a perceived slight from the british entourage out for the 50th anniversary of india 's independence .
future greatness i 'm sure that if the big brother controversy had been played out then , the reaction of the indian media would have been much more akin to the kind of aggressive nationalism displayed by the british tabloids against the french .
but as india this year prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary of independent rule one thing seems to be clear .
india has stopped looking over its shoulder .
it no longer views itself through the prism of its colonial past .
the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have .
india no longer feels the need to dwell on past injustices because it 's too busy getting ready for what many predict will be its future greatness .
there has been outrage here at the treatment of shilpa shetty .
but there has also been acknowledgement that there has been equal outrage in the uk from brown , black and white people alike .
there was no crowd when goody emerged because of security fears the condemnation by britain 's political class from the prime minister down has received the same attention as the comments from the indian government .
the only exception to this measured response were the half dozen chaps in bihar who found their 15 minutes of fame by burning a rather bad effigy of the channel four executives .
but no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis , which was recycled endlessly on tv around the world , represents the rest of the nation .
so despite the shrill cry from the british media , there was never any chance that this was going to become a diplomatic incident during the visit of britain 's finance minister , gordon brown .
his entourage were probably having kittens when the media started asking him about this story but the reality is that today 's indian leadership is much more interested in solidifying its place in the international pecking order than scoring cheap points off the likely next british prime minister .
better educated one english commentator noted after the row erupted that " shilpa shetty has taken the supposed british virtues of civility , articulacy , reserve and having a stiff upper lip and shown that .. we lack them " .
that 's not all india does better than the uk these days .
in terms of their celebrity status shilpa and her nemesis jade goody are almost on a par .
but taken as a snap shot of like-for-like india 's b-grade celebrities are clearly better educated , better mannered and frankly speak better english than their uk counterparts .
' ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
unfortunately for the uk it 's not just indian celebrities .
british companies have been outsourcing their customer service centres , software departments , biotechnology labs etc to the subcontinent for years now .
they did so because they recognised a huge pool of well-educated , english-speaking , middle-class people that could do the job not only cheaper than the folks back home , but often better .
jade goody clearly believed that her behaviour would be tolerated by the british public watching outside .
she was wrong .
ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
her antics also over-shadowed mr brown 's trip here .
but long term she may have helped mr brown make a fairly important point to the british public .
gordon brown had never set foot in india before last week .
but he already knew the challenges its huge pool of young people posed to the uk economy .
he outlined the challenges in his annual economic review late last year .
ms goody articulates in her crassness the fact that your average english-speaking indian -lrb- most of whom have been through private schooling -rrb- is a lot better educated than your average english person .
and by the way there are probably more than 100 million of them .
if you 're british then shilpa shetty in all her well-mannered educated politeness is a lot more scary that jade goody could ever hope to be .
if you would like to send a comment about this story you can use the form below .
here is a selection of your comments so far .
what i find mind-boggling is that a woman like jade goody who has accomplished absolutely nothing in her life can be made a " celebrity " by the british people .
this , while multitudes of good , honest and hard-working britons struggle to make end meet .
what does this say about the kind of trashy society that great britain has become ? ?
chris alam , usa what has the world come to ?
so much commotion over tv series , when so much hunger , poverty , religious discord and health issues are yet to be dealt with .
zoe rebelo , tanzania , e africa it is completely unrealistic to say that all call centres etc have been outsourced to india due to the fact that indians have a better standard of middle class , well educated people .
you have only to ask someone and they complain about the appalling level of english language that many have heard when calling these call centres .
i believe jade 's comments to have been blown out of proportion , and , writing this from australia where i currently live , find it absurd that it is hitting headlines here as well .
this has only highlighted the fact to me that the media is somewhat farcical , and is prepared to report on anything to provoke a reaction .
the fact that this is being more widely reported than say , poverty in africa , is just ridiculous .
anna palmer , uk mr danahar 's views are typically orientalist , using journalism for venting out his repressed racism / upper class arrogance .
two examples are stark : 1 . " the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have " .
does he mean to say that india 's anti-colonialism was due to inferiority complex ? 2 .
" no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis " .
being south asia bureau editor , mr danahar knows what do such remarks connote .
it only shows how he shares the indian upper class arrogance , degrading not only biharis , but all poor people who are collectively called biharis in a derogatory manner .
kumarila , maryland -lrb- usa -rrb- excellent paul !
you have just about summed up everything that i would have wanted to say .
sateesh , canada very good article , and thanks for pointing out the fact that shilpa is in fact a b-grade actress .
and those few idiots in bihar -lrb- india 's most lawless state -rrb- who were burning all those effigies really gave a wrong impression of how we feel about the whole issue .
i would give the british a lot more credit for the way they handled the whole issue .
although a lot of them feel the comments made by jade goody were n't racist , they overwhelmingly disproved her behaviour on the show .
if this had happened in america , rest assured shilpa shetty would have been voted out of show for using the ' race card ' .
after staying in both countries , i have to say that the british are far more tolerant than americans .
so paul , do n't be too hard on your countrymen .
prem patel , india at the end of the day , the " incident " demonstrates the enduring , growing and changing relationship between britain and india .
it also demonstrated that boorish conduct will be denounced by indians and british alike who share similar values .
anthony , canada while the author so succinctly claims that " for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface " , he forgets that india is still a relatively newly independent country , bound to suffer from the ramifications of its very recent experiences with colonial rule .
hence , a few more decades might be needed to erase completely the bitter taste of this experience and for india to get over it .
the author would like the memory of the collective indian psyche to be very short .
alas , it does not work this way .
itishree trivedi , usa the big brother incident has brought out of the closet the hidden racism that underlies british society .
the great country of britain now needs to now correct itself before trying to solve world problems , as in iraq , afghanistan , africa etc .
britain should also stop beating on other countries for so called " human rights " violations .
dave , usa i was visiting england and saw the shows in question .
sure , jade was not so refined , but what strikes me in all this is that there 's about zero mention of the fact that shilpa was monumentally arrogant , condescending and dishonest .
when jade noted these things - in rather indelicate terms - shilpa did not address those issues , but chose to attack the way those issues were addressed ... which as anyone might expect , is only going to make anyone that much more displeased .
this " ooooh , poor shilpa " is nonsense and a foolish response to media hype in england and in india .
bob hough , usa the piece is absolute nonsense - the occupants of the big brother house are in no way a reflection of the citizens of this country -lrb- thank god -rrb- , and in attempting to draw conclusions on the relative national character of contemporary india and britain from it 's frankly weak stock , the author is doing nothing more than clutching at straws , showing himself to have been sucked in and brainwashed by a programme that is an insult to broadcasting and free thought .
institutions like the bbc have a duty not to allow programmes of big brother 's quality to prevail , and taking them seriously like this author does is tantamount to appeasement .
sensationalist articles such as this one , and the massive generalisations they make based on nothing but the most tenuous of premises , are as dangerous and irresponsible as giving the microphone to jade goody in the first place and allowing her to represent britain .
alex , uk india is maturing from its colonial past to a new era of its true identity of a conscious nation .
a. bose , us i am astounded at the fuss being made of this so called racism .
i am a uk citizen living in canada and when i went to india four years ago i was the brunt of a lot of racism by the indian citizens .
the expression of " you can dish it out but can not take it " comes to mind .
i did not ever comment on the remarks about me that i heard whilst in india i just chose to ignore them .
i then decided not to put my manufacturing plant there which cost several hundred people jobs .
there is racism in every culture and the people that are the most racist are the ones that criticise any racism directed toward them .
terrie trevillion , canada how dare you insult myself and my fellow british people with your inane , racist drivel .
firstly , shilpa has acted like a rude , selfish snob .
regularly telling people to , " shut up " if anything they said was n't to her liking or did n't tally with her wishes .
she even slapped cleo during one such incident .
not exactly the actions of a dignified lady .
there were numerous displays of selfishness , not least the shopping list that she took complete control of , denying jade a mere 500g of minced beef , whilst she ordered 10 chickens , roughly 30 to 40 times the financial expense of jade 's meagre request .
then she had the audacity to complain and lie about the stock cubes .
as for your claims that she 's articulate , " learn your vocabularies , learn your dictionaries " is n't the finest use of the english language i 've ever heard .
jonathan brooke lyons , uk by the way , has anyone pointed out that jade goody is actually mixed race herself ? ! ?
marcus , uk come on folks .. get a life !
two people clashed so what ?
monica quince , belgium i am married to a hindu man and have two lovely children and very much enjoy the indian culture .
i was appalled seeing big brother and i feel goody is just an ignorant foul mouthed bully .
my husband watches this more than me and he just saw it as bullying rather than true racism but everyone thinks differently in this subject - my eight-year-old son thought she was racist and a bully .
michelle pandit , england channel 4 should pay for ms goody to attend classes in cultural sensitivity .
big brother producers should be required to attend .
ms goody should volunteer to perform charitable work in india , preferably in bihar where effigies of channel 4 executives were burned .
ms shetty should agree to supervise ms goody 's work and be responsible for ms goody 's security and well being while in india .
ms. goody to bear all expenses and pay ms shetty for services rendered from the proceeds of her inevitable forthcoming " tell-all " book .
shashi rattan , usa even though with changing economy , invasion of television , greed for material and millions of problems - hopefully indians will not loose tolerance .
sanjiv patel , usa jade goody does n't represent the majority of britons , she does n't even represent celebrity in this country .
she represents a pathetic shameful but minority subculture of britain , and trust me .
the problem is in this country is that the silent majority are too often neglected , nobody cares about the intelligent modest people who run this country .
steve , uk mr danahar is not off the mark for the better part of his analysis , but sticking up for the likes of ms shetty is well , a bit too much .
no one forced these publicity-hungry has-been celebrities on these tv shows .
come on sir , india and britain have better things to do than pandering to the contrived sensibilities of the likes of ms shetty .
jaganniwas iyer , india i 'm british born , but i have never heard of jade goody .
come to that , i 've never heard of shilpa shetty either , but on my pc she looks a lot more attractive !
alan conroy , spain india and china will rule the world in the next 50 years .
raman chauhan , canada i wish the average person in the us could read this story and see what part he or she represents therein .
however , and i am sad to say this , my nation is full of denial , long and short term memory loss , and an over inflated sense of self .
this country is overpopulated by the likes of ms goody , and could stand to learn quite a bit from ms shetty .
thank you for the insight and yes , the us should be afraid as well .
joy garscadden , us it was a clash of culture , and jade 's is certainly the dominant culture of celebrity in this country at the moment .
pieter gerits , uk jade goody 's racism should be condemned .
mr danahar 's article , however , moves far beyond that topic , for a general " india 's better than britain " swipe .
of course , india has a huge , highly educated workforce .
and india is destined to be one of the most powerful economies -lrb- and rightly so ! -rrb- , but i sense here that such a reality is being used for an angry put down to a readership who , by default , are probably a lot more educated and open minded than jade goody .
thanks for the warning that brits should be scared , mr danahar .
is n't there a word for that kind of talk ?
i remember when the bbc was dispassionate !
tom dibble , united states let me understand this : shilpa shetty is a beautiful , articulate , poised and highly educated young lady , and we are supposed to be scared of her ?
attracted , in-love and gaga about her , definitely , but never ever scared !
jefferson , england i suggest that shilpa shetty had planned her protestations before she even entered the programme .
tony smith , spain shilpa , i think you have handled the situation well .
there is no point of arguing with a person who fails to give respect to others , or a nation .
dhruba chakravarty , australia what a frank , realistic view !
having in lived in britain for two years , i can not help admitting most of the above is true .
remus negoita , france i take no issue with paul danahar 's argument regarding the new indian middle class .
i would like to say , however , that he is callous in his remarks regarding postcolonial indian attitudes towards the british raj .
resentment over 200-plus years of imperial subjugation should not be so dismissively referred to as a " chip on the shoulder " and " knee jerk xenophobia . "
surely there is more to it than a mere attitude problem , and 60 years may not be quite enough time to " get over " two centuries of foreign rule .
moreover , loss of faraway colonies is far easier to accept and attain closure over , than a bloodbath in the wake of , and partly due to , an ill-planned imperial departure .
burney , boston , usa it is appalling how much jade is being bullied now and to see how people from a country -lrb- namely india -rrb- which itself is so racist , where religious violence occurs , where homosexuals , women and children are get horrific treatment- sometimes even at the hands of government officials , a country where caste system originated and inter-community prejudice is widespread has the gall to talk about tolerance !
clean up your own backyard first !
vic friman , sweden why is this news ?
mark , the netherlands as mr danahar writes , there might be in india 100 million of english speaking , well educated people , perhaps even better educated than their british pairs .
however , it is not to be forgotten that india has a fast growing population of 1 billion people .
so the well-educated middle-class only stands for less than 10 % of the total population .
the other 90 % are illiterate and appallingly poor , and most of them would probably kill in order to live in britain .
f. portillo , spain we curse and call our fellow citizens , always have , always will , it 's a british thing , however appalling , but nothing more becomes of it .
as soon as any kind of comment is made to , or about , a member of another country or religion , the whole thing is blown out of all proportion .
in order to intermingle with other races , the word racism wants obliterating altogether from the english language so that we can all get on with out lives .
carol , uk this incident reflects poorly upon britain 's image as the media and society seems to be building third class role models .
maybe time once again to focus on good , clean ' british ' values and throw out the trash ?
robin bhowmik , reading , uk the decline of one nation and the rise of another are manifest .
charles hazell , uk would someone please tell me why we are wasting so much time and energy on what is little more than a second rate show with second rate " celebrities " ?
carol , uk big brother is a very popular show and guess a very good platform for shilpa to highlight the indian values and traditions .
what is the harm in doing so ?
after all , most of the people only know india as being a rural nation of snake-charmers .
priya , canada in india you easily get publicity by courting controversies .
the media are waiting to pounce on any such trivial controversies .
but i really doubt whether shilpa 's career would be resurrected after this ugly incident .
raj singh , united states we can not think that jade goody , good and bad , represents all of england .
she does n't even represent all of her neighbourhood .
i understand some of the feelings associated with this incident , but to think that england is essentially retreating into social cannibalism is plain dumb .
lets keep some perspective .
van martin , london , england jane goody would not exist if we did not create her and now we are upset with what we created .
big brother is a shameful programme anyway but its the sort of rubbish most of us seem to demand .
of course we ought to scared of shilpa shetty but our only consolation should be that educated and polite people like her would be too disgusted to want to live in britain anyway .
adrian baron , kinsgtown , st. vincent and the grenadines i disapprove heartily of the way jade is reported to have behaved in the house , but i would stop short of drawing conclusions about british society from it , much as i would stop short of drawing conclusions about india from the ludicrous effigy burning scenes we witnessed .
tris , uk in recognition of the distinctly british attitude and values shilpa showed when tolerating ms goody and co 's abuse , why do n't we award her an honorary british citizenship ?
it would definitely help repair the damage to our international reputation abroad and set a benchmark for us back at home !
piers register , united kingdom i believe that the vast majority of the british people are civilised and decent , and their reaction to this incident confirms that .
but we should not be in denial about racist and such discriminatory attitudes existing in our societies -lrb- including in india -rrb- , and should do what is necessary to combat them .
that would be especially important in our increasingly multi-ethnic societies .
padma , india i had lived in watford for the past fourteen months and had seen the reality show .
there is no need for shilpa or for that matter any indian to feel offended as this is a show wherein each contestant tries to bully the other .
if shilpa felt offended she should have walked out of the show and if goody really meant what she meant , she was just ill informed .
the media also did not have better story to cover and they are highlighting an irrelevant issue .
shiva subramanya , india i agree with mr danahar about the indian reaction but the parallels between ms goody and shilpa shetty are few and far between .
ms goody represents the worst of modern britain whereas ms shetty represents something of the best that modern india has to offer .
we should remember that no nation is perfect .
if ms goody 's so called career is now at end however , britain will have taken a step in that direction .
pankaj , uk while ms goody 's comments are deplorable , she has expressed sincere -lrb- i hope -rrb- regrets in the course of her interview .
maybe it is time everybody put this behind them and look forward .
chandra ram , india the producers carefully crafted this conflict .
make no mistake , the black gentleman on the show is well educated and mannered too , but the white participants seem to have been rounded up at a local pub .
the demographic on the show is not representational , or fair , it is just constructed to incite .
i 've travelled to india and it is one of the " best read " nations in the world , but not everyone is well mannered and well read in india either .
if you put an uneducated indian on the show , they would potentially make ignorant statements as well .
maybe ms goody could n't afford private schooling as the " average " english speaking indian can .
i am curious from which source mr. danahar quotes this fact .
brett , japan i realised a long time ago , that when a person is insecure or does n't like herself , then instead of trying to be a better person , it is easier to bring others down to her level .
vashti bowlah , trinidad , west indies sure , britain is a long way from eradicating racism but no one should get any praise out of this entire episode .
sympathy for shilpa , may be .
abhijit rajan , india -lrb- resident of us -rrb- i do n't believe british people have anything to find scary about a large pool of possible immigrants who are well educated , speak english and have a desire to succeed .
coming from canada a country that has more than 20 % of its population foreign born i can say that immigrants contribute their fair share to society .
justin acton , edinburgh uk while there may be some individuals who are racist in britain , it 's not the institutionalised racism that exists in india .
steve , usa shilpa shetty is not a b-grade actress .
only she is n't the top most one .
i do n't think jade goody 's celebrity stature ever matched shilpa shetty 's .
shilpa shetty is a ' star ' , much more than what this article suggests .
anurag , india jade goody and shilpa shetty are a class apart in more ways than one .
mamta srivastava , canada a well written article .
paul danahar has understood india better and its people even better .
today 's india is poised for growth and development .
such acts will be seen as a non-issue but there are many in india who still feel britain is a racist society and this has added fuel to it .
paul belson , india superbly said , i could not agree more .
what jade highlighted in her diatribes last week was the presence , on every corner of our once sacred green land of shakespeare , chaucer , brunel and churchill , of an increasingly ignorant , spoilt , junk-food eating , anti-social , booze-worshipping , mtv ipod generation of young people that do not know the meaning of a hard day 's work .
since the uk lost all its heavy industry in the 80s the offspring of the working class has turned into an underclass .
ironically it takes something so representative of this useless generation - big brother , for us to realise this .
richard loach , canada finally , a balanced comment on modern british ignorance .
i do n't mean the allegedly -lrb- or perhaps actually -rrb- racist remarks - i did not follow the big brother story , because big brother is rubbish .
i mean mr danahar 's pointed comment that ' your average english-speaking indian ... is a lot better educated than your average english person ' .
sadly , my experience tends rather to support this claim .
many of the younger -lrb- and not-so-young -rrb- generation in britain seem to think ignorance a virtue , and boorishness a substitute for thought .
let 's hope that this ' many ' is in fact a minority , but i have my doubts .
d fear , germany i currently run a project scaling up an india supplier .
they have etiquette and expertise .
technically they are educated to a better standard , higher motivation and a strong willingness to learn .
i worry for the uk as the standard of graduate is generally poor .

ann k , uk sorry for being a pain but i was annoyed by some inaccuracies in this article .
just thought that you might like to know that shilpa shetty is a critically acclaimed actress and if you would look at the list of the top indian actresses you would probably put her fifth on this .
i am no ' fan boy ' but she is definitely not on anything other than the a-list in terms of celebrity status in india .
therefore , saying that she is an indian b-grade celebrity is not nice , rather just insulting looking at her talent and dignity in bad situations , and you just can not compare her to jade goody in any way .
all i ask is that you research on your subject before writing , please !

it 's a sweeping , inaccurate generalisation but it 's the impression that might have been left in the minds of millions of people in india who last week watched one of their own being , to use the english vernacular , " slagged off " mercilessly on british tv .
contrary to much of the reporting around the world shilpa shetty is not a major bollywood star .
if she was she would not have shared a stage with the british b-grade celebrities also stuck inside the big brother house .
the programme makers would n't have been able to afford her pay cheque .
but while she may not have been the darling of the big screen in india before she entered the reality show , she 'll emerge , regardless of the means of her exit as a darling of the indian middle class .
onslaught there has been a palpable sense of pride with the way she has dealt with what is widely seen here as racist , foul-mouthed onslaughts from her clearly under-educated , boorish english companions .
ms goody articulates in all her crassness the fact that your average english speaking indian is a lot better educated than your average english person send your comments but more interestingly the incident has also shown that india , contrary to the fears of british diplomats , has become comfortable enough with its position in the world to see things like the big brother row in perspective .
the indian media has had a feeding frenzy on this story .
it 's dominated the headlines and been wall-to-wall across the dozens of new tv news channels that have sprung up over the last few years .
what there has n't been is a knee jerk xenophobia against the british , in response to an indian woman being abused by descendants of the old raj .
shetty 's treatment sparked protests in india last week for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface .
given an opportunity indian leaders would fall over themselves to take a dig at the british for an easy bit of popular press .
the best example of this was when the then prime minister ik gujral publicly called the uk a " third rate " country in petulant response to a perceived slight from the british entourage out for the 50th anniversary of india 's independence .
future greatness i 'm sure that if the big brother controversy had been played out then , the reaction of the indian media would have been much more akin to the kind of aggressive nationalism displayed by the british tabloids against the french .
but as india this year prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary of independent rule one thing seems to be clear .
india has stopped looking over its shoulder .
it no longer views itself through the prism of its colonial past .
the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have .
india no longer feels the need to dwell on past injustices because it 's too busy getting ready for what many predict will be its future greatness .
there has been outrage here at the treatment of shilpa shetty .
but there has also been acknowledgement that there has been equal outrage in the uk from brown , black and white people alike .
there was no crowd when goody emerged because of security fears the condemnation by britain 's political class from the prime minister down has received the same attention as the comments from the indian government .
the only exception to this measured response were the half dozen chaps in bihar who found their 15 minutes of fame by burning a rather bad effigy of the channel four executives .
but no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis , which was recycled endlessly on tv around the world , represents the rest of the nation .
so despite the shrill cry from the british media , there was never any chance that this was going to become a diplomatic incident during the visit of britain 's finance minister , gordon brown .
his entourage were probably having kittens when the media started asking him about this story but the reality is that today 's indian leadership is much more interested in solidifying its place in the international pecking order than scoring cheap points off the likely next british prime minister .
better educated one english commentator noted after the row erupted that " shilpa shetty has taken the supposed british virtues of civility , articulacy , reserve and having a stiff upper lip and shown that .. we lack them " .
that 's not all india does better than the uk these days .
in terms of their celebrity status shilpa and her nemesis jade goody are almost on a par .
but taken as a snap shot of like-for-like india 's b-grade celebrities are clearly better educated , better mannered and frankly speak better english than their uk counterparts .
' ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
unfortunately for the uk it 's not just indian celebrities .
british companies have been outsourcing their customer service centres , software departments , biotechnology labs etc to the subcontinent for years now .
they did so because they recognised a huge pool of well-educated , english-speaking , middle-class people that could do the job not only cheaper than the folks back home , but often better .
jade goody clearly believed that her behaviour would be tolerated by the british public watching outside .
she was wrong .
ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
her antics also over-shadowed mr brown 's trip here .
but long term she may have helped mr brown make a fairly important point to the british public .
gordon brown had never set foot in india before last week .
but he already knew the challenges its huge pool of young people posed to the uk economy .
he outlined the challenges in his annual economic review late last year .
ms goody articulates in her crassness the fact that your average english-speaking indian -lrb- most of whom have been through private schooling -rrb- is a lot better educated than your average english person .
and by the way there are probably more than 100 million of them .
if you 're british then shilpa shetty in all her well-mannered educated politeness is a lot more scary that jade goody could ever hope to be .
if you would like to send a comment about this story you can use the form below .
here is a selection of your comments so far .
what i find mind-boggling is that a woman like jade goody who has accomplished absolutely nothing in her life can be made a " celebrity " by the british people .
this , while multitudes of good , honest and hard-working britons struggle to make end meet .
what does this say about the kind of trashy society that great britain has become ? ?
chris alam , usa what has the world come to ?
so much commotion over tv series , when so much hunger , poverty , religious discord and health issues are yet to be dealt with .
zoe rebelo , tanzania , e africa it is completely unrealistic to say that all call centres etc have been outsourced to india due to the fact that indians have a better standard of middle class , well educated people .
you have only to ask someone and they complain about the appalling level of english language that many have heard when calling these call centres .
i believe jade 's comments to have been blown out of proportion , and , writing this from australia where i currently live , find it absurd that it is hitting headlines here as well .
this has only highlighted the fact to me that the media is somewhat farcical , and is prepared to report on anything to provoke a reaction .
the fact that this is being more widely reported than say , poverty in africa , is just ridiculous .
anna palmer , uk mr danahar 's views are typically orientalist , using journalism for venting out his repressed racism / upper class arrogance .
two examples are stark : 1 . " the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have " .
does he mean to say that india 's anti-colonialism was due to inferiority complex ? 2 .
" no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis " .
being south asia bureau editor , mr danahar knows what do such remarks connote .
it only shows how he shares the indian upper class arrogance , degrading not only biharis , but all poor people who are collectively called biharis in a derogatory manner .
kumarila , maryland -lrb- usa -rrb- excellent paul !
you have just about summed up everything that i would have wanted to say .
sateesh , canada very good article , and thanks for pointing out the fact that shilpa is in fact a b-grade actress .
and those few idiots in bihar -lrb- india 's most lawless state -rrb- who were burning all those effigies really gave a wrong impression of how we feel about the whole issue .
i would give the british a lot more credit for the way they handled the whole issue .
although a lot of them feel the comments made by jade goody were n't racist , they overwhelmingly disproved her behaviour on the show .
if this had happened in america , rest assured shilpa shetty would have been voted out of show for using the ' race card ' .
after staying in both countries , i have to say that the british are far more tolerant than americans .
so paul , do n't be too hard on your countrymen .
prem patel , india at the end of the day , the " incident " demonstrates the enduring , growing and changing relationship between britain and india .
it also demonstrated that boorish conduct will be denounced by indians and british alike who share similar values .
anthony , canada while the author so succinctly claims that " for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface " , he forgets that india is still a relatively newly independent country , bound to suffer from the ramifications of its very recent experiences with colonial rule .
hence , a few more decades might be needed to erase completely the bitter taste of this experience and for india to get over it .
the author would like the memory of the collective indian psyche to be very short .
alas , it does not work this way .
itishree trivedi , usa the big brother incident has brought out of the closet the hidden racism that underlies british society .
the great country of britain now needs to now correct itself before trying to solve world problems , as in iraq , afghanistan , africa etc .
britain should also stop beating on other countries for so called " human rights " violations .
dave , usa i was visiting england and saw the shows in question .
sure , jade was not so refined , but what strikes me in all this is that there 's about zero mention of the fact that shilpa was monumentally arrogant , condescending and dishonest .
when jade noted these things - in rather indelicate terms - shilpa did not address those issues , but chose to attack the way those issues were addressed ... which as anyone might expect , is only going to make anyone that much more displeased .
this " ooooh , poor shilpa " is nonsense and a foolish response to media hype in england and in india .
bob hough , usa the piece is absolute nonsense - the occupants of the big brother house are in no way a reflection of the citizens of this country -lrb- thank god -rrb- , and in attempting to draw conclusions on the relative national character of contemporary india and britain from it 's frankly weak stock , the author is doing nothing more than clutching at straws , showing himself to have been sucked in and brainwashed by a programme that is an insult to broadcasting and free thought .
institutions like the bbc have a duty not to allow programmes of big brother 's quality to prevail , and taking them seriously like this author does is tantamount to appeasement .
sensationalist articles such as this one , and the massive generalisations they make based on nothing but the most tenuous of premises , are as dangerous and irresponsible as giving the microphone to jade goody in the first place and allowing her to represent britain .
alex , uk india is maturing from its colonial past to a new era of its true identity of a conscious nation .
a. bose , us i am astounded at the fuss being made of this so called racism .
i am a uk citizen living in canada and when i went to india four years ago i was the brunt of a lot of racism by the indian citizens .
the expression of " you can dish it out but can not take it " comes to mind .
i did not ever comment on the remarks about me that i heard whilst in india i just chose to ignore them .
i then decided not to put my manufacturing plant there which cost several hundred people jobs .
there is racism in every culture and the people that are the most racist are the ones that criticise any racism directed toward them .
terrie trevillion , canada how dare you insult myself and my fellow british people with your inane , racist drivel .
firstly , shilpa has acted like a rude , selfish snob .
regularly telling people to , " shut up " if anything they said was n't to her liking or did n't tally with her wishes .
she even slapped cleo during one such incident .
not exactly the actions of a dignified lady .
there were numerous displays of selfishness , not least the shopping list that she took complete control of , denying jade a mere 500g of minced beef , whilst she ordered 10 chickens , roughly 30 to 40 times the financial expense of jade 's meagre request .
then she had the audacity to complain and lie about the stock cubes .
as for your claims that she 's articulate , " learn your vocabularies , learn your dictionaries " is n't the finest use of the english language i 've ever heard .
jonathan brooke lyons , uk by the way , has anyone pointed out that jade goody is actually mixed race herself ? ! ?
marcus , uk come on folks .. get a life !
two people clashed so what ?
monica quince , belgium i am married to a hindu man and have two lovely children and very much enjoy the indian culture .
i was appalled seeing big brother and i feel goody is just an ignorant foul mouthed bully .
my husband watches this more than me and he just saw it as bullying rather than true racism but everyone thinks differently in this subject - my eight-year-old son thought she was racist and a bully .
michelle pandit , england channel 4 should pay for ms goody to attend classes in cultural sensitivity .
big brother producers should be required to attend .
ms goody should volunteer to perform charitable work in india , preferably in bihar where effigies of channel 4 executives were burned .
ms shetty should agree to supervise ms goody 's work and be responsible for ms goody 's security and well being while in india .
ms. goody to bear all expenses and pay ms shetty for services rendered from the proceeds of her inevitable forthcoming " tell-all " book .
shashi rattan , usa even though with changing economy , invasion of television , greed for material and millions of problems - hopefully indians will not loose tolerance .
sanjiv patel , usa jade goody does n't represent the majority of britons , she does n't even represent celebrity in this country .
she represents a pathetic shameful but minority subculture of britain , and trust me .
the problem is in this country is that the silent majority are too often neglected , nobody cares about the intelligent modest people who run this country .
steve , uk mr danahar is not off the mark for the better part of his analysis , but sticking up for the likes of ms shetty is well , a bit too much .
no one forced these publicity-hungry has-been celebrities on these tv shows .
come on sir , india and britain have better things to do than pandering to the contrived sensibilities of the likes of ms shetty .
jaganniwas iyer , india i 'm british born , but i have never heard of jade goody .
come to that , i 've never heard of shilpa shetty either , but on my pc she looks a lot more attractive !
alan conroy , spain india and china will rule the world in the next 50 years .
raman chauhan , canada i wish the average person in the us could read this story and see what part he or she represents therein .
however , and i am sad to say this , my nation is full of denial , long and short term memory loss , and an over inflated sense of self .
this country is overpopulated by the likes of ms goody , and could stand to learn quite a bit from ms shetty .
thank you for the insight and yes , the us should be afraid as well .
joy garscadden , us it was a clash of culture , and jade 's is certainly the dominant culture of celebrity in this country at the moment .
pieter gerits , uk jade goody 's racism should be condemned .
mr danahar 's article , however , moves far beyond that topic , for a general " india 's better than britain " swipe .
of course , india has a huge , highly educated workforce .
and india is destined to be one of the most powerful economies -lrb- and rightly so ! -rrb- , but i sense here that such a reality is being used for an angry put down to a readership who , by default , are probably a lot more educated and open minded than jade goody .
thanks for the warning that brits should be scared , mr danahar .
is n't there a word for that kind of talk ?
i remember when the bbc was dispassionate !
tom dibble , united states let me understand this : shilpa shetty is a beautiful , articulate , poised and highly educated young lady , and we are supposed to be scared of her ?
attracted , in-love and gaga about her , definitely , but never ever scared !
jefferson , england i suggest that shilpa shetty had planned her protestations before she even entered the programme .
tony smith , spain shilpa , i think you have handled the situation well .
there is no point of arguing with a person who fails to give respect to others , or a nation .
dhruba chakravarty , australia what a frank , realistic view !
having in lived in britain for two years , i can not help admitting most of the above is true .
remus negoita , france i take no issue with paul danahar 's argument regarding the new indian middle class .
i would like to say , however , that he is callous in his remarks regarding postcolonial indian attitudes towards the british raj .
resentment over 200-plus years of imperial subjugation should not be so dismissively referred to as a " chip on the shoulder " and " knee jerk xenophobia . "
surely there is more to it than a mere attitude problem , and 60 years may not be quite enough time to " get over " two centuries of foreign rule .
moreover , loss of faraway colonies is far easier to accept and attain closure over , than a bloodbath in the wake of , and partly due to , an ill-planned imperial departure .
burney , boston , usa it is appalling how much jade is being bullied now and to see how people from a country -lrb- namely india -rrb- which itself is so racist , where religious violence occurs , where homosexuals , women and children are get horrific treatment- sometimes even at the hands of government officials , a country where caste system originated and inter-community prejudice is widespread has the gall to talk about tolerance !
clean up your own backyard first !
vic friman , sweden why is this news ?
mark , the netherlands as mr danahar writes , there might be in india 100 million of english speaking , well educated people , perhaps even better educated than their british pairs .
however , it is not to be forgotten that india has a fast growing population of 1 billion people .
so the well-educated middle-class only stands for less than 10 % of the total population .
the other 90 % are illiterate and appallingly poor , and most of them would probably kill in order to live in britain .
f. portillo , spain we curse and call our fellow citizens , always have , always will , it 's a british thing , however appalling , but nothing more becomes of it .
as soon as any kind of comment is made to , or about , a member of another country or religion , the whole thing is blown out of all proportion .
in order to intermingle with other races , the word racism wants obliterating altogether from the english language so that we can all get on with out lives .
carol , uk this incident reflects poorly upon britain 's image as the media and society seems to be building third class role models .
maybe time once again to focus on good , clean ' british ' values and throw out the trash ?
robin bhowmik , reading , uk the decline of one nation and the rise of another are manifest .
charles hazell , uk would someone please tell me why we are wasting so much time and energy on what is little more than a second rate show with second rate " celebrities " ?
carol , uk big brother is a very popular show and guess a very good platform for shilpa to highlight the indian values and traditions .
what is the harm in doing so ?
after all , most of the people only know india as being a rural nation of snake-charmers .
priya , canada in india you easily get publicity by courting controversies .
the media are waiting to pounce on any such trivial controversies .
but i really doubt whether shilpa 's career would be resurrected after this ugly incident .
raj singh , united states we can not think that jade goody , good and bad , represents all of england .
she does n't even represent all of her neighbourhood .
i understand some of the feelings associated with this incident , but to think that england is essentially retreating into social cannibalism is plain dumb .
lets keep some perspective .
van martin , london , england jane goody would not exist if we did not create her and now we are upset with what we created .
big brother is a shameful programme anyway but its the sort of rubbish most of us seem to demand .
of course we ought to scared of shilpa shetty but our only consolation should be that educated and polite people like her would be too disgusted to want to live in britain anyway .
adrian baron , kinsgtown , st. vincent and the grenadines i disapprove heartily of the way jade is reported to have behaved in the house , but i would stop short of drawing conclusions about british society from it , much as i would stop short of drawing conclusions about india from the ludicrous effigy burning scenes we witnessed .
tris , uk in recognition of the distinctly british attitude and values shilpa showed when tolerating ms goody and co 's abuse , why do n't we award her an honorary british citizenship ?
it would definitely help repair the damage to our international reputation abroad and set a benchmark for us back at home !
piers register , united kingdom i believe that the vast majority of the british people are civilised and decent , and their reaction to this incident confirms that .
but we should not be in denial about racist and such discriminatory attitudes existing in our societies -lrb- including in india -rrb- , and should do what is necessary to combat them .
that would be especially important in our increasingly multi-ethnic societies .
padma , india i had lived in watford for the past fourteen months and had seen the reality show .
there is no need for shilpa or for that matter any indian to feel offended as this is a show wherein each contestant tries to bully the other .
if shilpa felt offended she should have walked out of the show and if goody really meant what she meant , she was just ill informed .
the media also did not have better story to cover and they are highlighting an irrelevant issue .
shiva subramanya , india i agree with mr danahar about the indian reaction but the parallels between ms goody and shilpa shetty are few and far between .
ms goody represents the worst of modern britain whereas ms shetty represents something of the best that modern india has to offer .
we should remember that no nation is perfect .
if ms goody 's so called career is now at end however , britain will have taken a step in that direction .
pankaj , uk while ms goody 's comments are deplorable , she has expressed sincere -lrb- i hope -rrb- regrets in the course of her interview .
maybe it is time everybody put this behind them and look forward .
chandra ram , india the producers carefully crafted this conflict .
make no mistake , the black gentleman on the show is well educated and mannered too , but the white participants seem to have been rounded up at a local pub .
the demographic on the show is not representational , or fair , it is just constructed to incite .
i 've travelled to india and it is one of the " best read " nations in the world , but not everyone is well mannered and well read in india either .
if you put an uneducated indian on the show , they would potentially make ignorant statements as well .
maybe ms goody could n't afford private schooling as the " average " english speaking indian can .
i am curious from which source mr. danahar quotes this fact .
brett , japan i realised a long time ago , that when a person is insecure or does n't like herself , then instead of trying to be a better person , it is easier to bring others down to her level .
vashti bowlah , trinidad , west indies sure , britain is a long way from eradicating racism but no one should get any praise out of this entire episode .
sympathy for shilpa , may be .
abhijit rajan , india -lrb- resident of us -rrb- i do n't believe british people have anything to find scary about a large pool of possible immigrants who are well educated , speak english and have a desire to succeed .
coming from canada a country that has more than 20 % of its population foreign born i can say that immigrants contribute their fair share to society .
justin acton , edinburgh uk while there may be some individuals who are racist in britain , it 's not the institutionalised racism that exists in india .
steve , usa shilpa shetty is not a b-grade actress .
only she is n't the top most one .
i do n't think jade goody 's celebrity stature ever matched shilpa shetty 's .
shilpa shetty is a ' star ' , much more than what this article suggests .
anurag , india jade goody and shilpa shetty are a class apart in more ways than one .
mamta srivastava , canada a well written article .
paul danahar has understood india better and its people even better .
today 's india is poised for growth and development .
such acts will be seen as a non-issue but there are many in india who still feel britain is a racist society and this has added fuel to it .
paul belson , india superbly said , i could not agree more .
what jade highlighted in her diatribes last week was the presence , on every corner of our once sacred green land of shakespeare , chaucer , brunel and churchill , of an increasingly ignorant , spoilt , junk-food eating , anti-social , booze-worshipping , mtv ipod generation of young people that do not know the meaning of a hard day 's work .
since the uk lost all its heavy industry in the 80s the offspring of the working class has turned into an underclass .
ironically it takes something so representative of this useless generation - big brother , for us to realise this .
richard loach , canada finally , a balanced comment on modern british ignorance .
i do n't mean the allegedly -lrb- or perhaps actually -rrb- racist remarks - i did not follow the big brother story , because big brother is rubbish .
i mean mr danahar 's pointed comment that ' your average english-speaking indian ... is a lot better educated than your average english person ' .
sadly , my experience tends rather to support this claim .
many of the younger -lrb- and not-so-young -rrb- generation in britain seem to think ignorance a virtue , and boorishness a substitute for thought .
let 's hope that this ' many ' is in fact a minority , but i have my doubts .
d fear , germany i currently run a project scaling up an india supplier .
they have etiquette and expertise .
technically they are educated to a better standard , higher motivation and a strong willingness to learn .
i worry for the uk as the standard of graduate is generally poor .
inability to spell , add up or tackle difficult tasks are evidence of the successive failings of our pass rate driven education system .
the manners and etiquette ?
liberalisation of society has handed rights to child and handcuffed the teacher .
rights may well be fundamental but they also need maturity and intelligence to be exercised responsibly .
gareth knowling , uk considering the state of moral and cultural decay of our european societies , it is not unlikely that within 10 or 20 years we shall be polishing the shoes of our indians and chinese masters .
i am inclined to think that we shall deserve it .
jean-bernard brisset , france india does n't have a chip on its shoulder ? ?
carl , nottingham , uk shilpa may be a b class actor but she handled herself like an first class human being .
dorothy green , us jade goody represents everything that is wrong with this country .
she is a cringe worthy example of someone in the public eye that sends out wrong messages to many young people here and abroad .
her lack of education and culture does nothing to our country 's image .
ann k , uk sorry for being a pain but i was annoyed by some inaccuracies in this article .
just thought that you might like to know that shilpa shetty is a critically acclaimed actress and if you would look at the list of the top indian actresses you would probably put her fifth on this .
i am no ' fan boy ' but she is definitely not on anything other than the a-list in terms of celebrity status in india .
therefore , saying that she is an indian b-grade celebrity is not nice , rather just insulting looking at her talent and dignity in bad situations , and you just can not compare her to jade goody in any way .
all i ask is that you research on your subject before writing , please !

it 's a sweeping , inaccurate generalisation but it 's the impression that might have been left in the minds of millions of people in india who last week watched one of their own being , to use the english vernacular , " slagged off " mercilessly on british tv .
contrary to much of the reporting around the world shilpa shetty is not a major bollywood star .
if she was she would not have shared a stage with the british b-grade celebrities also stuck inside the big brother house .
the programme makers would n't have been able to afford her pay cheque .
but while she may not have been the darling of the big screen in india before she entered the reality show , she 'll emerge , regardless of the means of her exit as a darling of the indian middle class .
onslaught there has been a palpable sense of pride with the way she has dealt with what is widely seen here as racist , foul-mouthed onslaughts from her clearly under-educated , boorish english companions .
ms goody articulates in all her crassness the fact that your average english speaking indian is a lot better educated than your average english person send your comments but more interestingly the incident has also shown that india , contrary to the fears of british diplomats , has become comfortable enough with its position in the world to see things like the big brother row in perspective .
the indian media has had a feeding frenzy on this story .
it 's dominated the headlines and been wall-to-wall across the dozens of new tv news channels that have sprung up over the last few years .
what there has n't been is a knee jerk xenophobia against the british , in response to an indian woman being abused by descendants of the old raj .
shetty 's treatment sparked protests in india last week for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface .
given an opportunity indian leaders would fall over themselves to take a dig at the british for an easy bit of popular press .
the best example of this was when the then prime minister ik gujral publicly called the uk a " third rate " country in petulant response to a perceived slight from the british entourage out for the 50th anniversary of india 's independence .
future greatness i 'm sure that if the big brother controversy had been played out then , the reaction of the indian media would have been much more akin to the kind of aggressive nationalism displayed by the british tabloids against the french .
but as india this year prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary of independent rule one thing seems to be clear .
india has stopped looking over its shoulder .
it no longer views itself through the prism of its colonial past .
the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have .
india no longer feels the need to dwell on past injustices because it 's too busy getting ready for what many predict will be its future greatness .
there has been outrage here at the treatment of shilpa shetty .
but there has also been acknowledgement that there has been equal outrage in the uk from brown , black and white people alike .
there was no crowd when goody emerged because of security fears the condemnation by britain 's political class from the prime minister down has received the same attention as the comments from the indian government .
the only exception to this measured response were the half dozen chaps in bihar who found their 15 minutes of fame by burning a rather bad effigy of the channel four executives .
but no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis , which was recycled endlessly on tv around the world , represents the rest of the nation .
so despite the shrill cry from the british media , there was never any chance that this was going to become a diplomatic incident during the visit of britain 's finance minister , gordon brown .
his entourage were probably having kittens when the media started asking him about this story but the reality is that today 's indian leadership is much more interested in solidifying its place in the international pecking order than scoring cheap points off the likely next british prime minister .
better educated one english commentator noted after the row erupted that " shilpa shetty has taken the supposed british virtues of civility , articulacy , reserve and having a stiff upper lip and shown that .. we lack them " .
that 's not all india does better than the uk these days .
in terms of their celebrity status shilpa and her nemesis jade goody are almost on a par .
but taken as a snap shot of like-for-like india 's b-grade celebrities are clearly better educated , better mannered and frankly speak better english than their uk counterparts .
' ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
unfortunately for the uk it 's not just indian celebrities .
british companies have been outsourcing their customer service centres , software departments , biotechnology labs etc to the subcontinent for years now .
they did so because they recognised a huge pool of well-educated , english-speaking , middle-class people that could do the job not only cheaper than the folks back home , but often better .
jade goody clearly believed that her behaviour would be tolerated by the british public watching outside .
she was wrong .
ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
her antics also over-shadowed mr brown 's trip here .
but long term she may have helped mr brown make a fairly important point to the british public .
gordon brown had never set foot in india before last week .
but he already knew the challenges its huge pool of young people posed to the uk economy .
he outlined the challenges in his annual economic review late last year .
ms goody articulates in her crassness the fact that your average english-speaking indian -lrb- most of whom have been through private schooling -rrb- is a lot better educated than your average english person .
and by the way there are probably more than 100 million of them .
if you 're british then shilpa shetty in all her well-mannered educated politeness is a lot more scary that jade goody could ever hope to be .
if you would like to send a comment about this story you can use the form below .
here is a selection of your comments so far .
what i find mind-boggling is that a woman like jade goody who has accomplished absolutely nothing in her life can be made a " celebrity " by the british people .
this , while multitudes of good , honest and hard-working britons struggle to make end meet .
what does this say about the kind of trashy society that great britain has become ? ?
chris alam , usa what has the world come to ?
so much commotion over tv series , when so much hunger , poverty , religious discord and health issues are yet to be dealt with .
zoe rebelo , tanzania , e africa it is completely unrealistic to say that all call centres etc have been outsourced to india due to the fact that indians have a better standard of middle class , well educated people .
you have only to ask someone and they complain about the appalling level of english language that many have heard when calling these call centres .
i believe jade 's comments to have been blown out of proportion , and , writing this from australia where i currently live , find it absurd that it is hitting headlines here as well .
this has only highlighted the fact to me that the media is somewhat farcical , and is prepared to report on anything to provoke a reaction .
the fact that this is being more widely reported than say , poverty in africa , is just ridiculous .
anna palmer , uk mr danahar 's views are typically orientalist , using journalism for venting out his repressed racism / upper class arrogance .
two examples are stark : 1 . " the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have " .
does he mean to say that india 's anti-colonialism was due to inferiority complex ? 2 .
" no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis " .
being south asia bureau editor , mr danahar knows what do such remarks connote .
it only shows how he shares the indian upper class arrogance , degrading not only biharis , but all poor people who are collectively called biharis in a derogatory manner .
kumarila , maryland -lrb- usa -rrb- excellent paul !
you have just about summed up everything that i would have wanted to say .
sateesh , canada very good article , and thanks for pointing out the fact that shilpa is in fact a b-grade actress .
and those few idiots in bihar -lrb- india 's most lawless state -rrb- who were burning all those effigies really gave a wrong impression of how we feel about the whole issue .
i would give the british a lot more credit for the way they handled the whole issue .
although a lot of them feel the comments made by jade goody were n't racist , they overwhelmingly disproved her behaviour on the show .
if this had happened in america , rest assured shilpa shetty would have been voted out of show for using the ' race card ' .
after staying in both countries , i have to say that the british are far more tolerant than americans .
so paul , do n't be too hard on your countrymen .
prem patel , india at the end of the day , the " incident " demonstrates the enduring , growing and changing relationship between britain and india .
it also demonstrated that boorish conduct will be denounced by indians and british alike who share similar values .
anthony , canada while the author so succinctly claims that " for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface " , he forgets that india is still a relatively newly independent country , bound to suffer from the ramifications of its very recent experiences with colonial rule .
hence , a few more decades might be needed to erase completely the bitter taste of this experience and for india to get over it .
the author would like the memory of the collective indian psyche to be very short .
alas , it does not work this way .
itishree trivedi , usa the big brother incident has brought out of the closet the hidden racism that underlies british society .
the great country of britain now needs to now correct itself before trying to solve world problems , as in iraq , afghanistan , africa etc .
britain should also stop beating on other countries for so called " human rights " violations .
dave , usa i was visiting england and saw the shows in question .
sure , jade was not so refined , but what strikes me in all this is that there 's about zero mention of the fact that shilpa was monumentally arrogant , condescending and dishonest .
when jade noted these things - in rather indelicate terms - shilpa did not address those issues , but chose to attack the way those issues were addressed ... which as anyone might expect , is only going to make anyone that much more displeased .
this " ooooh , poor shilpa " is nonsense and a foolish response to media hype in england and in india .
bob hough , usa the piece is absolute nonsense - the occupants of the big brother house are in no way a reflection of the citizens of this country -lrb- thank god -rrb- , and in attempting to draw conclusions on the relative national character of contemporary india and britain from it 's frankly weak stock , the author is doing nothing more than clutching at straws , showing himself to have been sucked in and brainwashed by a programme that is an insult to broadcasting and free thought .
institutions like the bbc have a duty not to allow programmes of big brother 's quality to prevail , and taking them seriously like this author does is tantamount to appeasement .
sensationalist articles such as this one , and the massive generalisations they make based on nothing but the most tenuous of premises , are as dangerous and irresponsible as giving the microphone to jade goody in the first place and allowing her to represent britain .
alex , uk india is maturing from its colonial past to a new era of its true identity of a conscious nation .
a. bose , us i am astounded at the fuss being made of this so called racism .
i am a uk citizen living in canada and when i went to india four years ago i was the brunt of a lot of racism by the indian citizens .
the expression of " you can dish it out but can not take it " comes to mind .
i did not ever comment on the remarks about me that i heard whilst in india i just chose to ignore them .
i then decided not to put my manufacturing plant there which cost several hundred people jobs .
there is racism in every culture and the people that are the most racist are the ones that criticise any racism directed toward them .
terrie trevillion , canada how dare you insult myself and my fellow british people with your inane , racist drivel .
firstly , shilpa has acted like a rude , selfish snob .
regularly telling people to , " shut up " if anything they said was n't to her liking or did n't tally with her wishes .
she even slapped cleo during one such incident .
not exactly the actions of a dignified lady .
there were numerous displays of selfishness , not least the shopping list that she took complete control of , denying jade a mere 500g of minced beef , whilst she ordered 10 chickens , roughly 30 to 40 times the financial expense of jade 's meagre request .
then she had the audacity to complain and lie about the stock cubes .
as for your claims that she 's articulate , " learn your vocabularies , learn your dictionaries " is n't the finest use of the english language i 've ever heard .
jonathan brooke lyons , uk by the way , has anyone pointed out that jade goody is actually mixed race herself ? ! ?
marcus , uk come on folks .. get a life !
two people clashed so what ?
monica quince , belgium i am married to a hindu man and have two lovely children and very much enjoy the indian culture .
i was appalled seeing big brother and i feel goody is just an ignorant foul mouthed bully .
my husband watches this more than me and he just saw it as bullying rather than true racism but everyone thinks differently in this subject - my eight-year-old son thought she was racist and a bully .
michelle pandit , england channel 4 should pay for ms goody to attend classes in cultural sensitivity .
big brother producers should be required to attend .
ms goody should volunteer to perform charitable work in india , preferably in bihar where effigies of channel 4 executives were burned .
ms shetty should agree to supervise ms goody 's work and be responsible for ms goody 's security and well being while in india .
ms. goody to bear all expenses and pay ms shetty for services rendered from the proceeds of her inevitable forthcoming " tell-all " book .
shashi rattan , usa even though with changing economy , invasion of television , greed for material and millions of problems - hopefully indians will not loose tolerance .
sanjiv patel , usa jade goody does n't represent the majority of britons , she does n't even represent celebrity in this country .
she represents a pathetic shameful but minority subculture of britain , and trust me .
the problem is in this country is that the silent majority are too often neglected , nobody cares about the intelligent modest people who run this country .
steve , uk mr danahar is not off the mark for the better part of his analysis , but sticking up for the likes of ms shetty is well , a bit too much .
no one forced these publicity-hungry has-been celebrities on these tv shows .
come on sir , india and britain have better things to do than pandering to the contrived sensibilities of the likes of ms shetty .
jaganniwas iyer , india i 'm british born , but i have never heard of jade goody .
come to that , i 've never heard of shilpa shetty either , but on my pc she looks a lot more attractive !
alan conroy , spain india and china will rule the world in the next 50 years .
raman chauhan , canada i wish the average person in the us could read this story and see what part he or she represents therein .
however , and i am sad to say this , my nation is full of denial , long and short term memory loss , and an over inflated sense of self .
this country is overpopulated by the likes of ms goody , and could stand to learn quite a bit from ms shetty .
thank you for the insight and yes , the us should be afraid as well .
joy garscadden , us it was a clash of culture , and jade 's is certainly the dominant culture of celebrity in this country at the moment .
pieter gerits , uk jade goody 's racism should be condemned .
mr danahar 's article , however , moves far beyond that topic , for a general " india 's better than britain " swipe .
of course , india has a huge , highly educated workforce .
and india is destined to be one of the most powerful economies -lrb- and rightly so ! -rrb- , but i sense here that such a reality is being used for an angry put down to a readership who , by default , are probably a lot more educated and open minded than jade goody .
thanks for the warning that brits should be scared , mr danahar .
is n't there a word for that kind of talk ?
i remember when the bbc was dispassionate !
tom dibble , united states let me understand this : shilpa shetty is a beautiful , articulate , poised and highly educated young lady , and we are supposed to be scared of her ?
attracted , in-love and gaga about her , definitely , but never ever scared !
jefferson , england i suggest that shilpa shetty had planned her protestations before she even entered the programme .
tony smith , spain shilpa , i think you have handled the situation well .
there is no point of arguing with a person who fails to give respect to others , or a nation .
dhruba chakravarty , australia what a frank , realistic view !
having in lived in britain for two years , i can not help admitting most of the above is true .
remus negoita , france i take no issue with paul danahar 's argument regarding the new indian middle class .
i would like to say , however , that he is callous in his remarks regarding postcolonial indian attitudes towards the british raj .
resentment over 200-plus years of imperial subjugation should not be so dismissively referred to as a " chip on the shoulder " and " knee jerk xenophobia . "
surely there is more to it than a mere attitude problem , and 60 years may not be quite enough time to " get over " two centuries of foreign rule .
moreover , loss of faraway colonies is far easier to accept and attain closure over , than a bloodbath in the wake of , and partly due to , an ill-planned imperial departure .
burney , boston , usa it is appalling how much jade is being bullied now and to see how people from a country -lrb- namely india -rrb- which itself is so racist , where religious violence occurs , where homosexuals , women and children are get horrific treatment- sometimes even at the hands of government officials , a country where caste system originated and inter-community prejudice is widespread has the gall to talk about tolerance !
clean up your own backyard first !
vic friman , sweden why is this news ?
mark , the netherlands as mr danahar writes , there might be in india 100 million of english speaking , well educated people , perhaps even better educated than their british pairs .
however , it is not to be forgotten that india has a fast growing population of 1 billion people .
so the well-educated middle-class only stands for less than 10 % of the total population .
the other 90 % are illiterate and appallingly poor , and most of them would probably kill in order to live in britain .
f. portillo , spain we curse and call our fellow citizens , always have , always will , it 's a british thing , however appalling , but nothing more becomes of it .
as soon as any kind of comment is made to , or about , a member of another country or religion , the whole thing is blown out of all proportion .
in order to intermingle with other races , the word racism wants obliterating altogether from the english language so that we can all get on with out lives .
carol , uk this incident reflects poorly upon britain 's image as the media and society seems to be building third class role models .
maybe time once again to focus on good , clean ' british ' values and throw out the trash ?
robin bhowmik , reading , uk the decline of one nation and the rise of another are manifest .
charles hazell , uk would someone please tell me why we are wasting so much time and energy on what is little more than a second rate show with second rate " celebrities " ?
carol , uk big brother is a very popular show and guess a very good platform for shilpa to highlight the indian values and traditions .
what is the harm in doing so ?
after all , most of the people only know india as being a rural nation of snake-charmers .
priya , canada in india you easily get publicity by courting controversies .
the media are waiting to pounce on any such trivial controversies .
but i really doubt whether shilpa 's career would be resurrected after this ugly incident .
raj singh , united states we can not think that jade goody , good and bad , represents all of england .
she does n't even represent all of her neighbourhood .
i understand some of the feelings associated with this incident , but to think that england is essentially retreating into social cannibalism is plain dumb .
lets keep some perspective .
van martin , london , england jane goody would not exist if we did not create her and now we are upset with what we created .
big brother is a shameful programme anyway but its the sort of rubbish most of us seem to demand .
of course we ought to scared of shilpa shetty but our only consolation should be that educated and polite people like her would be too disgusted to want to live in britain anyway .
adrian baron , kinsgtown , st. vincent and the grenadines i disapprove heartily of the way jade is reported to have behaved in the house , but i would stop short of drawing conclusions about british society from it , much as i would stop short of drawing conclusions about india from the ludicrous effigy burning scenes we witnessed .
tris , uk in recognition of the distinctly british attitude and values shilpa showed when tolerating ms goody and co 's abuse , why do n't we award her an honorary british citizenship ?
it would definitely help repair the damage to our international reputation abroad and set a benchmark for us back at home !
piers register , united kingdom i believe that the vast majority of the british people are civilised and decent , and their reaction to this incident confirms that .
but we should not be in denial about racist and such discriminatory attitudes existing in our societies -lrb- including in india -rrb- , and should do what is necessary to combat them .
that would be especially important in our increasingly multi-ethnic societies .
padma , india i had lived in watford for the past fourteen months and had seen the reality show .
there is no need for shilpa or for that matter any indian to feel offended as this is a show wherein each contestant tries to bully the other .
if shilpa felt offended she should have walked out of the show and if goody really meant what she meant , she was just ill informed .
the media also did not have better story to cover and they are highlighting an irrelevant issue .
shiva subramanya , india i agree with mr danahar about the indian reaction but the parallels between ms goody and shilpa shetty are few and far between .
ms goody represents the worst of modern britain whereas ms shetty represents something of the best that modern india has to offer .
we should remember that no nation is perfect .
if ms goody 's so called career is now at end however , britain will have taken a step in that direction .
pankaj , uk while ms goody 's comments are deplorable , she has expressed sincere -lrb- i hope -rrb- regrets in the course of her interview .
maybe it is time everybody put this behind them and look forward .
chandra ram , india the producers carefully crafted this conflict .
make no mistake , the black gentleman on the show is well educated and mannered too , but the white participants seem to have been rounded up at a local pub .
the demographic on the show is not representational , or fair , it is just constructed to incite .
i 've travelled to india and it is one of the " best read " nations in the world , but not everyone is well mannered and well read in india either .
if you put an uneducated indian on the show , they would potentially make ignorant statements as well .
maybe ms goody could n't afford private schooling as the " average " english speaking indian can .
i am curious from which source mr. danahar quotes this fact .
brett , japan i realised a long time ago , that when a person is insecure or does n't like herself , then instead of trying to be a better person , it is easier to bring others down to her level .
vashti bowlah , trinidad , west indies sure , britain is a long way from eradicating racism but no one should get any praise out of this entire episode .
sympathy for shilpa , may be .
abhijit rajan , india -lrb- resident of us -rrb- i do n't believe british people have anything to find scary about a large pool of possible immigrants who are well educated , speak english and have a desire to succeed .
coming from canada a country that has more than 20 % of its population foreign born i can say that immigrants contribute their fair share to society .
justin acton , edinburgh uk while there may be some individuals who are racist in britain , it 's not the institutionalised racism that exists in india .
steve , usa shilpa shetty is not a b-grade actress .
only she is n't the top most one .
i do n't think jade goody 's celebrity stature ever matched shilpa shetty 's .
shilpa shetty is a ' star ' , much more than what this article suggests .
anurag , india jade goody and shilpa shetty are a class apart in more ways than one .
mamta srivastava , canada a well written article .
paul danahar has understood india better and its people even better .
today 's india is poised for growth and development .
such acts will be seen as a non-issue but there are many in india who still feel britain is a racist society and this has added fuel to it .
paul belson , india superbly said , i could not agree more .
what jade highlighted in her diatribes last week was the presence , on every corner of our once sacred green land of shakespeare , chaucer , brunel and churchill , of an increasingly ignorant , spoilt , junk-food eating , anti-social , booze-worshipping , mtv ipod generation of young people that do not know the meaning of a hard day 's work .
since the uk lost all its heavy industry in the 80s the offspring of the working class has turned into an underclass .
ironically it takes something so representative of this useless generation - big brother , for us to realise this .
richard loach , canada finally , a balanced comment on modern british ignorance .
i do n't mean the allegedly -lrb- or perhaps actually -rrb- racist remarks - i did not follow the big brother story , because big brother is rubbish .
i mean mr danahar 's pointed comment that ' your average english-speaking indian ... is a lot better educated than your average english person ' .
sadly , my experience tends rather to support this claim .
many of the younger -lrb- and not-so-young -rrb- generation in britain seem to think ignorance a virtue , and boorishness a substitute for thought .
let 's hope that this ' many ' is in fact a minority , but i have my doubts .
d fear , germany i currently run a project scaling up an india supplier .
they have etiquette and expertise .
technically they are educated to a better standard , higher motivation and a strong willingness to learn .
i worry for the uk as the standard of graduate is generally poor .
inability to spell , add up or tackle difficult tasks are evidence of the successive failings of our pass rate driven education system .
the manners and etiquette ?
liberalisation of society has handed rights to child and handcuffed the teacher .
rights may well be fundamental but they also need maturity and intelligence to be exercised responsibly .
gareth knowling , uk considering the state of moral and cultural decay of our european societies , it is not unlikely that within 10 or 20 years we shall be polishing the shoes of our indians and chinese masters .
i am inclined to think that we shall deserve it .
jean-bernard brisset , france india does n't have a chip on its shoulder ? ?
carl , nottingham , uk shilpa may be a b class actor but she handled herself like an first class human being .
dorothy green , us jade goody represents everything that is wrong with this country .
she is a cringe worthy example of someone in the public eye that sends out wrong messages to many young people here and abroad .
her lack of education and culture does nothing to our country 's image .
ann k , uk sorry for being a pain but i was annoyed by some inaccuracies in this article .
just thought that you might like to know that shilpa shetty is a critically acclaimed actress and if you would look at the list of the top indian actresses you would probably put her fifth on this .
i am no ' fan boy ' but she is definitely not on anything other than the a-list in terms of celebrity status in india .
therefore , saying that she is an indian b-grade celebrity is not nice , rather just insulting looking at her talent and dignity in bad situations , and you just can not compare her to jade goody in any way .
all i ask is that you research on your subject before writing , please !

it 's a sweeping , inaccurate generalisation but it 's the impression that might have been left in the minds of millions of people in india who last week watched one of their own being , to use the english vernacular , " slagged off " mercilessly on british tv .
contrary to much of the reporting around the world shilpa shetty is not a major bollywood star .
if she was she would not have shared a stage with the british b-grade celebrities also stuck inside the big brother house .
the programme makers would n't have been able to afford her pay cheque .
but while she may not have been the darling of the big screen in india before she entered the reality show , she 'll emerge , regardless of the means of her exit as a darling of the indian middle class .
onslaught there has been a palpable sense of pride with the way she has dealt with what is widely seen here as racist , foul-mouthed onslaughts from her clearly under-educated , boorish english companions .
ms goody articulates in all her crassness the fact that your average english speaking indian is a lot better educated than your average english person send your comments but more interestingly the incident has also shown that india , contrary to the fears of british diplomats , has become comfortable enough with its position in the world to see things like the big brother row in perspective .
the indian media has had a feeding frenzy on this story .
it 's dominated the headlines and been wall-to-wall across the dozens of new tv news channels that have sprung up over the last few years .
what there has n't been is a knee jerk xenophobia against the british , in response to an indian woman being abused by descendants of the old raj .
shetty 's treatment sparked protests in india last week for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface .
given an opportunity indian leaders would fall over themselves to take a dig at the british for an easy bit of popular press .
the best example of this was when the then prime minister ik gujral publicly called the uk a " third rate " country in petulant response to a perceived slight from the british entourage out for the 50th anniversary of india 's independence .
future greatness i 'm sure that if the big brother controversy had been played out then , the reaction of the indian media would have been much more akin to the kind of aggressive nationalism displayed by the british tabloids against the french .
but as india this year prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary of independent rule one thing seems to be clear .
india has stopped looking over its shoulder .
it no longer views itself through the prism of its colonial past .
the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have .
india no longer feels the need to dwell on past injustices because it 's too busy getting ready for what many predict will be its future greatness .
there has been outrage here at the treatment of shilpa shetty .
but there has also been acknowledgement that there has been equal outrage in the uk from brown , black and white people alike .
there was no crowd when goody emerged because of security fears the condemnation by britain 's political class from the prime minister down has received the same attention as the comments from the indian government .
the only exception to this measured response were the half dozen chaps in bihar who found their 15 minutes of fame by burning a rather bad effigy of the channel four executives .
but no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis , which was recycled endlessly on tv around the world , represents the rest of the nation .
so despite the shrill cry from the british media , there was never any chance that this was going to become a diplomatic incident during the visit of britain 's finance minister , gordon brown .
his entourage were probably having kittens when the media started asking him about this story but the reality is that today 's indian leadership is much more interested in solidifying its place in the international pecking order than scoring cheap points off the likely next british prime minister .
better educated one english commentator noted after the row erupted that " shilpa shetty has taken the supposed british virtues of civility , articulacy , reserve and having a stiff upper lip and shown that .. we lack them " .
that 's not all india does better than the uk these days .
in terms of their celebrity status shilpa and her nemesis jade goody are almost on a par .
but taken as a snap shot of like-for-like india 's b-grade celebrities are clearly better educated , better mannered and frankly speak better english than their uk counterparts .
' ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
unfortunately for the uk it 's not just indian celebrities .
british companies have been outsourcing their customer service centres , software departments , biotechnology labs etc to the subcontinent for years now .
they did so because they recognised a huge pool of well-educated , english-speaking , middle-class people that could do the job not only cheaper than the folks back home , but often better .
jade goody clearly believed that her behaviour would be tolerated by the british public watching outside .
she was wrong .
ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
her antics also over-shadowed mr brown 's trip here .
but long term she may have helped mr brown make a fairly important point to the british public .
gordon brown had never set foot in india before last week .
but he already knew the challenges its huge pool of young people posed to the uk economy .
he outlined the challenges in his annual economic review late last year .
ms goody articulates in her crassness the fact that your average english-speaking indian -lrb- most of whom have been through private schooling -rrb- is a lot better educated than your average english person .
and by the way there are probably more than 100 million of them .
if you 're british then shilpa shetty in all her well-mannered educated politeness is a lot more scary that jade goody could ever hope to be .
if you would like to send a comment about this story you can use the form below .
here is a selection of your comments so far .
what i find mind-boggling is that a woman like jade goody who has accomplished absolutely nothing in her life can be made a " celebrity " by the british people .
this , while multitudes of good , honest and hard-working britons struggle to make end meet .
what does this say about the kind of trashy society that great britain has become ? ?
chris alam , usa what has the world come to ?
so much commotion over tv series , when so much hunger , poverty , religious discord and health issues are yet to be dealt with .
zoe rebelo , tanzania , e africa it is completely unrealistic to say that all call centres etc have been outsourced to india due to the fact that indians have a better standard of middle class , well educated people .
you have only to ask someone and they complain about the appalling level of english language that many have heard when calling these call centres .
i believe jade 's comments to have been blown out of proportion , and , writing this from australia where i currently live , find it absurd that it is hitting headlines here as well .
this has only highlighted the fact to me that the media is somewhat farcical , and is prepared to report on anything to provoke a reaction .
the fact that this is being more widely reported than say , poverty in africa , is just ridiculous .
anna palmer , uk mr danahar 's views are typically orientalist , using journalism for venting out his repressed racism / upper class arrogance .
two examples are stark : 1 . " the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have " .
does he mean to say that india 's anti-colonialism was due to inferiority complex ? 2 .
" no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis " .
being south asia bureau editor , mr danahar knows what do such remarks connote .
it only shows how he shares the indian upper class arrogance , degrading not only biharis , but all poor people who are collectively called biharis in a derogatory manner .
kumarila , maryland -lrb- usa -rrb- excellent paul !
you have just about summed up everything that i would have wanted to say .
sateesh , canada very good article , and thanks for pointing out the fact that shilpa is in fact a b-grade actress .
and those few idiots in bihar -lrb- india 's most lawless state -rrb- who were burning all those effigies really gave a wrong impression of how we feel about the whole issue .
i would give the british a lot more credit for the way they handled the whole issue .
although a lot of them feel the comments made by jade goody were n't racist , they overwhelmingly disproved her behaviour on the show .
if this had happened in america , rest assured shilpa shetty would have been voted out of show for using the ' race card ' .
after staying in both countries , i have to say that the british are far more tolerant than americans .
so paul , do n't be too hard on your countrymen .
prem patel , india at the end of the day , the " incident " demonstrates the enduring , growing and changing relationship between britain and india .
it also demonstrated that boorish conduct will be denounced by indians and british alike who share similar values .
anthony , canada while the author so succinctly claims that " for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface " , he forgets that india is still a relatively newly independent country , bound to suffer from the ramifications of its very recent experiences with colonial rule .
hence , a few more decades might be needed to erase completely the bitter taste of this experience and for india to get over it .
the author would like the memory of the collective indian psyche to be very short .
alas , it does not work this way .
itishree trivedi , usa the big brother incident has brought out of the closet the hidden racism that underlies british society .
the great country of britain now needs to now correct itself before trying to solve world problems , as in iraq , afghanistan , africa etc .
britain should also stop beating on other countries for so called " human rights " violations .
dave , usa i was visiting england and saw the shows in question .
sure , jade was not so refined , but what strikes me in all this is that there 's about zero mention of the fact that shilpa was monumentally arrogant , condescending and dishonest .
when jade noted these things - in rather indelicate terms - shilpa did not address those issues , but chose to attack the way those issues were addressed ... which as anyone might expect , is only going to make anyone that much more displeased .
this " ooooh , poor shilpa " is nonsense and a foolish response to media hype in england and in india .
bob hough , usa the piece is absolute nonsense - the occupants of the big brother house are in no way a reflection of the citizens of this country -lrb- thank god -rrb- , and in attempting to draw conclusions on the relative national character of contemporary india and britain from it 's frankly weak stock , the author is doing nothing more than clutching at straws , showing himself to have been sucked in and brainwashed by a programme that is an insult to broadcasting and free thought .
institutions like the bbc have a duty not to allow programmes of big brother 's quality to prevail , and taking them seriously like this author does is tantamount to appeasement .
sensationalist articles such as this one , and the massive generalisations they make based on nothing but the most tenuous of premises , are as dangerous and irresponsible as giving the microphone to jade goody in the first place and allowing her to represent britain .
alex , uk india is maturing from its colonial past to a new era of its true identity of a conscious nation .
a. bose , us i am astounded at the fuss being made of this so called racism .
i am a uk citizen living in canada and when i went to india four years ago i was the brunt of a lot of racism by the indian citizens .
the expression of " you can dish it out but can not take it " comes to mind .
i did not ever comment on the remarks about me that i heard whilst in india i just chose to ignore them .
i then decided not to put my manufacturing plant there which cost several hundred people jobs .
there is racism in every culture and the people that are the most racist are the ones that criticise any racism directed toward them .
terrie trevillion , canada how dare you insult myself and my fellow british people with your inane , racist drivel .
firstly , shilpa has acted like a rude , selfish snob .
regularly telling people to , " shut up " if anything they said was n't to her liking or did n't tally with her wishes .
she even slapped cleo during one such incident .
not exactly the actions of a dignified lady .
there were numerous displays of selfishness , not least the shopping list that she took complete control of , denying jade a mere 500g of minced beef , whilst she ordered 10 chickens , roughly 30 to 40 times the financial expense of jade 's meagre request .
then she had the audacity to complain and lie about the stock cubes .
as for your claims that she 's articulate , " learn your vocabularies , learn your dictionaries " is n't the finest use of the english language i 've ever heard .
jonathan brooke lyons , uk by the way , has anyone pointed out that jade goody is actually mixed race herself ? ! ?
marcus , uk come on folks .. get a life !
two people clashed so what ?
monica quince , belgium i am married to a hindu man and have two lovely children and very much enjoy the indian culture .
i was appalled seeing big brother and i feel goody is just an ignorant foul mouthed bully .
my husband watches this more than me and he just saw it as bullying rather than true racism but everyone thinks differently in this subject - my eight-year-old son thought she was racist and a bully .
michelle pandit , england channel 4 should pay for ms goody to attend classes in cultural sensitivity .
big brother producers should be required to attend .
ms goody should volunteer to perform charitable work in india , preferably in bihar where effigies of channel 4 executives were burned .
ms shetty should agree to supervise ms goody 's work and be responsible for ms goody 's security and well being while in india .
ms. goody to bear all expenses and pay ms shetty for services rendered from the proceeds of her inevitable forthcoming " tell-all " book .
shashi rattan , usa even though with changing economy , invasion of television , greed for material and millions of problems - hopefully indians will not loose tolerance .
sanjiv patel , usa jade goody does n't represent the majority of britons , she does n't even represent celebrity in this country .
she represents a pathetic shameful but minority subculture of britain , and trust me .
the problem is in this country is that the silent majority are too often neglected , nobody cares about the intelligent modest people who run this country .
steve , uk mr danahar is not off the mark for the better part of his analysis , but sticking up for the likes of ms shetty is well , a bit too much .
no one forced these publicity-hungry has-been celebrities on these tv shows .
come on sir , india and britain have better things to do than pandering to the contrived sensibilities of the likes of ms shetty .
jaganniwas iyer , india i 'm british born , but i have never heard of jade goody .
come to that , i 've never heard of shilpa shetty either , but on my pc she looks a lot more attractive !
alan conroy , spain india and china will rule the world in the next 50 years .
raman chauhan , canada i wish the average person in the us could read this story and see what part he or she represents therein .
however , and i am sad to say this , my nation is full of denial , long and short term memory loss , and an over inflated sense of self .
this country is overpopulated by the likes of ms goody , and could stand to learn quite a bit from ms shetty .
thank you for the insight and yes , the us should be afraid as well .
joy garscadden , us it was a clash of culture , and jade 's is certainly the dominant culture of celebrity in this country at the moment .
pieter gerits , uk jade goody 's racism should be condemned .
mr danahar 's article , however , moves far beyond that topic , for a general " india 's better than britain " swipe .
of course , india has a huge , highly educated workforce .
and india is destined to be one of the most powerful economies -lrb- and rightly so ! -rrb- , but i sense here that such a reality is being used for an angry put down to a readership who , by default , are probably a lot more educated and open minded than jade goody .
thanks for the warning that brits should be scared , mr danahar .
is n't there a word for that kind of talk ?
i remember when the bbc was dispassionate !
tom dibble , united states let me understand this : shilpa shetty is a beautiful , articulate , poised and highly educated young lady , and we are supposed to be scared of her ?
attracted , in-love and gaga about her , definitely , but never ever scared !
jefferson , england i suggest that shilpa shetty had planned her protestations before she even entered the programme .
tony smith , spain shilpa , i think you have handled the situation well .
there is no point of arguing with a person who fails to give respect to others , or a nation .
dhruba chakravarty , australia what a frank , realistic view !
having in lived in britain for two years , i can not help admitting most of the above is true .
remus negoita , france i take no issue with paul danahar 's argument regarding the new indian middle class .
i would like to say , however , that he is callous in his remarks regarding postcolonial indian attitudes towards the british raj .
resentment over 200-plus years of imperial subjugation should not be so dismissively referred to as a " chip on the shoulder " and " knee jerk xenophobia . "
surely there is more to it than a mere attitude problem , and 60 years may not be quite enough time to " get over " two centuries of foreign rule .
moreover , loss of faraway colonies is far easier to accept and attain closure over , than a bloodbath in the wake of , and partly due to , an ill-planned imperial departure .
burney , boston , usa it is appalling how much jade is being bullied now and to see how people from a country -lrb- namely india -rrb- which itself is so racist , where religious violence occurs , where homosexuals , women and children are get horrific treatment- sometimes even at the hands of government officials , a country where caste system originated and inter-community prejudice is widespread has the gall to talk about tolerance !
clean up your own backyard first !
vic friman , sweden why is this news ?
mark , the netherlands as mr danahar writes , there might be in india 100 million of english speaking , well educated people , perhaps even better educated than their british pairs .
however , it is not to be forgotten that india has a fast growing population of 1 billion people .
so the well-educated middle-class only stands for less than 10 % of the total population .
the other 90 % are illiterate and appallingly poor , and most of them would probably kill in order to live in britain .
f. portillo , spain we curse and call our fellow citizens , always have , always will , it 's a british thing , however appalling , but nothing more becomes of it .
as soon as any kind of comment is made to , or about , a member of another country or religion , the whole thing is blown out of all proportion .
in order to intermingle with other races , the word racism wants obliterating altogether from the english language so that we can all get on with out lives .
carol , uk this incident reflects poorly upon britain 's image as the media and society seems to be building third class role models .
maybe time once again to focus on good , clean ' british ' values and throw out the trash ?
robin bhowmik , reading , uk the decline of one nation and the rise of another are manifest .
charles hazell , uk would someone please tell me why we are wasting so much time and energy on what is little more than a second rate show with second rate " celebrities " ?
carol , uk big brother is a very popular show and guess a very good platform for shilpa to highlight the indian values and traditions .
what is the harm in doing so ?
after all , most of the people only know india as being a rural nation of snake-charmers .
priya , canada in india you easily get publicity by courting controversies .
the media are waiting to pounce on any such trivial controversies .
but i really doubt whether shilpa 's career would be resurrected after this ugly incident .
raj singh , united states we can not think that jade goody , good and bad , represents all of england .
she does n't even represent all of her neighbourhood .
i understand some of the feelings associated with this incident , but to think that england is essentially retreating into social cannibalism is plain dumb .
lets keep some perspective .
van martin , london , england jane goody would not exist if we did not create her and now we are upset with what we created .
big brother is a shameful programme anyway but its the sort of rubbish most of us seem to demand .
of course we ought to scared of shilpa shetty but our only consolation should be that educated and polite people like her would be too disgusted to want to live in britain anyway .
adrian baron , kinsgtown , st. vincent and the grenadines i disapprove heartily of the way jade is reported to have behaved in the house , but i would stop short of drawing conclusions about british society from it , much as i would stop short of drawing conclusions about india from the ludicrous effigy burning scenes we witnessed .
tris , uk in recognition of the distinctly british attitude and values shilpa showed when tolerating ms goody and co 's abuse , why do n't we award her an honorary british citizenship ?
it would definitely help repair the damage to our international reputation abroad and set a benchmark for us back at home !
piers register , united kingdom i believe that the vast majority of the british people are civilised and decent , and their reaction to this incident confirms that .
but we should not be in denial about racist and such discriminatory attitudes existing in our societies -lrb- including in india -rrb- , and should do what is necessary to combat them .
that would be especially important in our increasingly multi-ethnic societies .
padma , india i had lived in watford for the past fourteen months and had seen the reality show .
there is no need for shilpa or for that matter any indian to feel offended as this is a show wherein each contestant tries to bully the other .
if shilpa felt offended she should have walked out of the show and if goody really meant what she meant , she was just ill informed .
the media also did not have better story to cover and they are highlighting an irrelevant issue .
shiva subramanya , india i agree with mr danahar about the indian reaction but the parallels between ms goody and shilpa shetty are few and far between .
ms goody represents the worst of modern britain whereas ms shetty represents something of the best that modern india has to offer .
we should remember that no nation is perfect .
if ms goody 's so called career is now at end however , britain will have taken a step in that direction .
pankaj , uk while ms goody 's comments are deplorable , she has expressed sincere -lrb- i hope -rrb- regrets in the course of her interview .
maybe it is time everybody put this behind them and look forward .
chandra ram , india the producers carefully crafted this conflict .
make no mistake , the black gentleman on the show is well educated and mannered too , but the white participants seem to have been rounded up at a local pub .
the demographic on the show is not representational , or fair , it is just constructed to incite .
i 've travelled to india and it is one of the " best read " nations in the world , but not everyone is well mannered and well read in india either .
if you put an uneducated indian on the show , they would potentially make ignorant statements as well .
maybe ms goody could n't afford private schooling as the " average " english speaking indian can .
i am curious from which source mr. danahar quotes this fact .
brett , japan i realised a long time ago , that when a person is insecure or does n't like herself , then instead of trying to be a better person , it is easier to bring others down to her level .
vashti bowlah , trinidad , west indies sure , britain is a long way from eradicating racism but no one should get any praise out of this entire episode .
sympathy for shilpa , may be .
abhijit rajan , india -lrb- resident of us -rrb- i do n't believe british people have anything to find scary about a large pool of possible immigrants who are well educated , speak english and have a desire to succeed .
coming from canada a country that has more than 20 % of its population foreign born i can say that immigrants contribute their fair share to society .
justin acton , edinburgh uk while there may be some individuals who are racist in britain , it 's not the institutionalised racism that exists in india .
steve , usa shilpa shetty is not a b-grade actress .
only she is n't the top most one .
i do n't think jade goody 's celebrity stature ever matched shilpa shetty 's .
shilpa shetty is a ' star ' , much more than what this article suggests .
anurag , india jade goody and shilpa shetty are a class apart in more ways than one .
mamta srivastava , canada a well written article .
paul danahar has understood india better and its people even better .
today 's india is poised for growth and development .
such acts will be seen as a non-issue but there are many in india who still feel britain is a racist society and this has added fuel to it .
paul belson , india superbly said , i could not agree more .
what jade highlighted in her diatribes last week was the presence , on every corner of our once sacred green land of shakespeare , chaucer , brunel and churchill , of an increasingly ignorant , spoilt , junk-food eating , anti-social , booze-worshipping , mtv ipod generation of young people that do not know the meaning of a hard day 's work .
since the uk lost all its heavy industry in the 80s the offspring of the working class has turned into an underclass .
ironically it takes something so representative of this useless generation - big brother , for us to realise this .
richard loach , canada finally , a balanced comment on modern british ignorance .
i do n't mean the allegedly -lrb- or perhaps actually -rrb- racist remarks - i did not follow the big brother story , because big brother is rubbish .
i mean mr danahar 's pointed comment that ' your average english-speaking indian ... is a lot better educated than your average english person ' .
sadly , my experience tends rather to support this claim .
many of the younger -lrb- and not-so-young -rrb- generation in britain seem to think ignorance a virtue , and boorishness a substitute for thought .
let 's hope that this ' many ' is in fact a minority , but i have my doubts .
d fear , germany i currently run a project scaling up an india supplier .
they have etiquette and expertise .
technically they are educated to a better standard , higher motivation and a strong willingness to learn .
i worry for the uk as the standard of graduate is generally poor .
inability to spell , add up or tackle difficult tasks are evidence of the successive failings of our pass rate driven education system .
the manners and etiquette ?
liberalisation of society has handed rights to child and handcuffed the teacher .
rights may well be fundamental but they also need maturity and intelligence to be exercised responsibly .
gareth knowling , uk considering the state of moral and cultural decay of our european societies , it is not unlikely that within 10 or 20 years we shall be polishing the shoes of our indians and chinese masters .
i am inclined to think that we shall deserve it .
jean-bernard brisset , france india does n't have a chip on its shoulder ? ?
carl , nottingham , uk shilpa may be a b class actor but she handled herself like an first class human being .
dorothy green , us jade goody represents everything that is wrong with this country .
she is a cringe worthy example of someone in the public eye that sends out wrong messages to many young people here and abroad .
her lack of education and culture does nothing to our country 's image .
ann k , uk sorry for being a pain but i was annoyed by some inaccuracies in this article .
just thought that you might like to know that shilpa shetty is a critically acclaimed actress and if you would look at the list of the top indian actresses you would probably put her fifth on this .
i am no ' fan boy ' but she is definitely not on anything other than the a-list in terms of celebrity status in india .
therefore , saying that she is an indian b-grade celebrity is not nice , rather just insulting looking at her talent and dignity in bad situations , and you just can not compare her to jade goody in any way .
all i ask is that you research on your subject before writing , please !

it 's a sweeping , inaccurate generalisation but it 's the impression that might have been left in the minds of millions of people in india who last week watched one of their own being , to use the english vernacular , " slagged off " mercilessly on british tv .
contrary to much of the reporting around the world shilpa shetty is not a major bollywood star .
if she was she would not have shared a stage with the british b-grade celebrities also stuck inside the big brother house .
the programme makers would n't have been able to afford her pay cheque .
but while she may not have been the darling of the big screen in india before she entered the reality show , she 'll emerge , regardless of the means of her exit as a darling of the indian middle class .
onslaught there has been a palpable sense of pride with the way she has dealt with what is widely seen here as racist , foul-mouthed onslaughts from her clearly under-educated , boorish english companions .
ms goody articulates in all her crassness the fact that your average english speaking indian is a lot better educated than your average english person send your comments but more interestingly the incident has also shown that india , contrary to the fears of british diplomats , has become comfortable enough with its position in the world to see things like the big brother row in perspective .
the indian media has had a feeding frenzy on this story .
it 's dominated the headlines and been wall-to-wall across the dozens of new tv news channels that have sprung up over the last few years .
what there has n't been is a knee jerk xenophobia against the british , in response to an indian woman being abused by descendants of the old raj .
shetty 's treatment sparked protests in india last week for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface .
given an opportunity indian leaders would fall over themselves to take a dig at the british for an easy bit of popular press .
the best example of this was when the then prime minister ik gujral publicly called the uk a " third rate " country in petulant response to a perceived slight from the british entourage out for the 50th anniversary of india 's independence .
future greatness i 'm sure that if the big brother controversy had been played out then , the reaction of the indian media would have been much more akin to the kind of aggressive nationalism displayed by the british tabloids against the french .
but as india this year prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary of independent rule one thing seems to be clear .
india has stopped looking over its shoulder .
it no longer views itself through the prism of its colonial past .
the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have .
india no longer feels the need to dwell on past injustices because it 's too busy getting ready for what many predict will be its future greatness .
there has been outrage here at the treatment of shilpa shetty .
but there has also been acknowledgement that there has been equal outrage in the uk from brown , black and white people alike .
there was no crowd when goody emerged because of security fears the condemnation by britain 's political class from the prime minister down has received the same attention as the comments from the indian government .
the only exception to this measured response were the half dozen chaps in bihar who found their 15 minutes of fame by burning a rather bad effigy of the channel four executives .
but no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis , which was recycled endlessly on tv around the world , represents the rest of the nation .
so despite the shrill cry from the british media , there was never any chance that this was going to become a diplomatic incident during the visit of britain 's finance minister , gordon brown .
his entourage were probably having kittens when the media started asking him about this story but the reality is that today 's indian leadership is much more interested in solidifying its place in the international pecking order than scoring cheap points off the likely next british prime minister .
better educated one english commentator noted after the row erupted that " shilpa shetty has taken the supposed british virtues of civility , articulacy , reserve and having a stiff upper lip and shown that .. we lack them " .
that 's not all india does better than the uk these days .
in terms of their celebrity status shilpa and her nemesis jade goody are almost on a par .
but taken as a snap shot of like-for-like india 's b-grade celebrities are clearly better educated , better mannered and frankly speak better english than their uk counterparts .
' ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
unfortunately for the uk it 's not just indian celebrities .
british companies have been outsourcing their customer service centres , software departments , biotechnology labs etc to the subcontinent for years now .
they did so because they recognised a huge pool of well-educated , english-speaking , middle-class people that could do the job not only cheaper than the folks back home , but often better .
jade goody clearly believed that her behaviour would be tolerated by the british public watching outside .
she was wrong .
ms goody has earned the ire of many in the uk for trashing its reputation across the world .
her antics also over-shadowed mr brown 's trip here .
but long term she may have helped mr brown make a fairly important point to the british public .
gordon brown had never set foot in india before last week .
but he already knew the challenges its huge pool of young people posed to the uk economy .
he outlined the challenges in his annual economic review late last year .
ms goody articulates in her crassness the fact that your average english-speaking indian -lrb- most of whom have been through private schooling -rrb- is a lot better educated than your average english person .
and by the way there are probably more than 100 million of them .
if you 're british then shilpa shetty in all her well-mannered educated politeness is a lot more scary that jade goody could ever hope to be .
if you would like to send a comment about this story you can use the form below .
here is a selection of your comments so far .
what i find mind-boggling is that a woman like jade goody who has accomplished absolutely nothing in her life can be made a " celebrity " by the british people .
this , while multitudes of good , honest and hard-working britons struggle to make end meet .
what does this say about the kind of trashy society that great britain has become ? ?
chris alam , usa what has the world come to ?
so much commotion over tv series , when so much hunger , poverty , religious discord and health issues are yet to be dealt with .
zoe rebelo , tanzania , e africa it is completely unrealistic to say that all call centres etc have been outsourced to india due to the fact that indians have a better standard of middle class , well educated people .
you have only to ask someone and they complain about the appalling level of english language that many have heard when calling these call centres .
i believe jade 's comments to have been blown out of proportion , and , writing this from australia where i currently live , find it absurd that it is hitting headlines here as well .
this has only highlighted the fact to me that the media is somewhat farcical , and is prepared to report on anything to provoke a reaction .
the fact that this is being more widely reported than say , poverty in africa , is just ridiculous .
anna palmer , uk mr danahar 's views are typically orientalist , using journalism for venting out his repressed racism / upper class arrogance .
two examples are stark : 1 . " the " britishers " are no longer the bogeymen they used to be because india is no longer suffering from the inferiority complex it used to have " .
does he mean to say that india 's anti-colonialism was due to inferiority complex ? 2 .
" no-one in india is going to claim that the actions of a few underemployed biharis " .
being south asia bureau editor , mr danahar knows what do such remarks connote .
it only shows how he shares the indian upper class arrogance , degrading not only biharis , but all poor people who are collectively called biharis in a derogatory manner .
kumarila , maryland -lrb- usa -rrb- excellent paul !
you have just about summed up everything that i would have wanted to say .
sateesh , canada very good article , and thanks for pointing out the fact that shilpa is in fact a b-grade actress .
and those few idiots in bihar -lrb- india 's most lawless state -rrb- who were burning all those effigies really gave a wrong impression of how we feel about the whole issue .
i would give the british a lot more credit for the way they handled the whole issue .
although a lot of them feel the comments made by jade goody were n't racist , they overwhelmingly disproved her behaviour on the show .
if this had happened in america , rest assured shilpa shetty would have been voted out of show for using the ' race card ' .
after staying in both countries , i have to say that the british are far more tolerant than americans .
so paul , do n't be too hard on your countrymen .
prem patel , india at the end of the day , the " incident " demonstrates the enduring , growing and changing relationship between britain and india .
it also demonstrated that boorish conduct will be denounced by indians and british alike who share similar values .
anthony , canada while the author so succinctly claims that " for many years india had a real chip on its shoulder about the uk .
the injustices of the colonial era were never far from the surface " , he forgets that india is still a relatively newly independent country , bound to suffer from the ramifications of its very recent experiences with colonial rule .
hence , a few more decades might be needed to erase completely the bitter taste of this experience and for india to get over it .
the author would like the memory of the collective indian psyche to be very short .
alas , it does not work this way .
itishree trivedi , usa the big brother incident has brought out of the closet the hidden racism that underlies british society .
the great country of britain now needs to now correct itself before trying to solve world problems , as in iraq , afghanistan , africa etc .
britain should also stop beating on other countries for so called " human rights " violations .
dave , usa i was visiting england and saw the shows in question .
sure , jade was not so refined , but what strikes me in all this is that there 's about zero mention of the fact that shilpa was monumentally arrogant , condescending and dishonest .
when jade noted these things - in rather indelicate terms - shilpa did not address those issues , but chose to attack the way those issues were addressed ... which as anyone might expect , is only going to make anyone that much more displeased .
this " ooooh , poor shilpa " is nonsense and a foolish response to media hype in england and in india .
bob hough , usa the piece is absolute nonsense - the occupants of the big brother house are in no way a reflection of the citizens of this country -lrb- thank god -rrb- , and in attempting to draw conclusions on the relative national character of contemporary india and britain from it 's frankly weak stock , the author is doing nothing more than clutching at straws , showing himself to have been sucked in and brainwashed by a programme that is an insult to broadcasting and free thought .
institutions like the bbc have a duty not to allow programmes of big brother 's quality to prevail , and taking them seriously like this author does is tantamount to appeasement .
sensationalist articles such as this one , and the massive generalisations they make based on nothing but the most tenuous of premises , are as dangerous and irresponsible as giving the microphone to jade goody in the first place and allowing her to represent britain .
alex , uk india is maturing from its colonial past to a new era of its true identity of a conscious nation .
a. bose , us i am astounded at the fuss being made of this so called racism .
i am a uk citizen living in canada and when i went to india four years ago i was the brunt of a lot of racism by the indian citizens .
the expression of " you can dish it out but can not take it " comes to mind .
i did not ever comment on the remarks about me that i heard whilst in india i just chose to ignore them .
i then decided not to put my manufacturing plant there which cost several hundred people jobs .
there is racism in every culture and the people that are the most racist are the ones that criticise any racism directed toward them .
terrie trevillion , canada how dare you insult myself and my fellow british people with your inane , racist drivel .
firstly , shilpa has acted like a rude , selfish snob .
regularly telling people to , " shut up " if anything they said was n't to her liking or did n't tally with her wishes .
she even slapped cleo during one such incident .
not exactly the actions of a dignified lady .
there were numerous displays of selfishness , not least the shopping list that she took complete control of , denying jade a mere 500g of minced beef , whilst she ordered 10 chickens , roughly 30 to 40 times the financial expense of jade 's meagre request .
then she had the audacity to complain and lie about the stock cubes .
as for your claims that she 's articulate , " learn your vocabularies , learn your dictionaries " is n't the finest use of the english language i 've ever heard .
jonathan brooke lyons , uk by the way , has anyone pointed out that jade goody is actually mixed race herself ? ! ?
marcus , uk come on folks .. get a life !
two people clashed so what ?
monica quince , belgium i am married to a hindu man and have two lovely children and very much enjoy the indian culture .
i was appalled seeing big brother and i feel goody is just an ignorant foul mouthed bully .
my husband watches this more than me and he just saw it as bullying rather than true racism but everyone thinks differently in this subject - my eight-year-old son thought she was racist and a bully .
michelle pandit , england channel 4 should pay for ms goody to attend classes in cultural sensitivity .
big brother producers should be required to attend .
ms goody should volunteer to perform charitable work in india , preferably in bihar where effigies of channel 4 executives were burned .
ms shetty should agree to supervise ms goody 's work and be responsible for ms goody 's security and well being while in india .
ms. goody to bear all expenses and pay ms shetty for services rendered from the proceeds of her inevitable forthcoming " tell-all " book .
shashi rattan , usa even though with changing economy , invasion of television , greed for material and millions of problems - hopefully indians will not loose tolerance .
sanjiv patel , usa jade goody does n't represent the majority of britons , she does n't even represent celebrity in this country .
she represents a pathetic shameful but minority subculture of britain , and trust me .
the problem is in this country is that the silent majority are too often neglected , nobody cares about the intelligent modest people who run this country .
steve , uk mr danahar is not off the mark for the better part of his analysis , but sticking up for the likes of ms shetty is well , a bit too much .
no one forced these publicity-hungry has-been celebrities on these tv shows .
come on sir , india and britain have better things to do than pandering to the contrived sensibilities of the likes of ms shetty .
jaganniwas iyer , india i 'm british born , but i have never heard of jade goody .
come to that , i 've never heard of shilpa shetty either , but on my pc she looks a lot more attractive !
alan conroy , spain india and china will rule the world in the next 50 years .
raman chauhan , canada i wish the average person in the us could read this story and see what part he or she represents therein .
however , and i am sad to say this , my nation is full of denial , long and short term memory loss , and an over inflated sense of self .
this country is overpopulated by the likes of ms goody , and could stand to learn quite a bit from ms shetty .
thank you for the insight and yes , the us should be afraid as well .
joy garscadden , us it was a clash of culture , and jade 's is certainly the dominant culture of celebrity in this country at the moment .
pieter gerits , uk jade goody 's racism should be condemned .
mr danahar 's article , however , moves far beyond that topic , for a general " india 's better than britain " swipe .
of course , india has a huge , highly educated workforce .
and india is destined to be one of the most powerful economies -lrb- and rightly so ! -rrb- , but i sense here that such a reality is being used for an angry put down to a readership who , by default , are probably a lot more educated and open minded than jade goody .
thanks for the warning that brits should be scared , mr danahar .
is n't there a word for that kind of talk ?
i remember when the bbc was dispassionate !
tom dibble , united states let me understand this : shilpa shetty is a beautiful , articulate , poised and highly educated young lady , and we are supposed to be scared of her ?
attracted , in-love and gaga about her , definitely , but never ever scared !
jefferson , england i suggest that shilpa shetty had planned her protestations before she even entered the programme .
tony smith , spain shilpa , i think you have handled the situation well .
there is no point of arguing with a person who fails to give respect to others , or a nation .
dhruba chakravarty , australia what a frank , realistic view !
having in lived in britain for two years , i can not help admitting most of the above is true .
remus negoita , france i take no issue with paul danahar 's argument regarding the new indian middle class .
i would like to say , however , that he is callous in his remarks regarding postcolonial indian attitudes towards the british raj .
resentment over 200-plus years of imperial subjugation should not be so dismissively referred to as a " chip on the shoulder " and " knee jerk xenophobia . "
surely there is more to it than a mere attitude problem , and 60 years may not be quite enough time to " get over " two centuries of foreign rule .
moreover , loss of faraway colonies is far easier to accept and attain closure over , than a bloodbath in the wake of , and partly due to , an ill-planned imperial departure .
burney , boston , usa it is appalling how much jade is being bullied now and to see how people from a country -lrb- namely india -rrb- which itself is so racist , where religious violence occurs , where homosexuals , women and children are get horrific treatment- sometimes even at the hands of government officials , a country where caste system originated and inter-community prejudice is widespread has the gall to talk about tolerance !
clean up your own backyard first !
vic friman , sweden why is this news ?
mark , the netherlands as mr danahar writes , there might be in india 100 million of english speaking , well educated people , perhaps even better educated than their british pairs .
however , it is not to be forgotten that india has a fast growing population of 1 billion people .
so the well-educated middle-class only stands for less than 10 % of the total population .
the other 90 % are illiterate and appallingly poor , and most of them would probably kill in order to live in britain .
f. portillo , spain we curse and call our fellow citizens , always have , always will , it 's a british thing , however appalling , but nothing more becomes of it .
as soon as any kind of comment is made to , or about , a member of another country or religion , the whole thing is blown out of all proportion .
in order to intermingle with other races , the word racism wants obliterating altogether from the english language so that we can all get on with out lives .
carol , uk this incident reflects poorly upon britain 's image as the media and society seems to be building third class role models .
maybe time once again to focus on good , clean ' british ' values and throw out the trash ?
robin bhowmik , reading , uk the decline of one nation and the rise of another are manifest .
charles hazell , uk would someone please tell me why we are wasting so much time and energy on what is little more than a second rate show with second rate " celebrities " ?
carol , uk big brother is a very popular show and guess a very good platform for shilpa to highlight the indian values and traditions .
what is the harm in doing so ?
after all , most of the people only know india as being a rural nation of snake-charmers .
priya , canada in india you easily get publicity by courting controversies .
the media are waiting to pounce on any such trivial controversies .
but i really doubt whether shilpa 's career would be resurrected after this ugly incident .
raj singh , united states we can not think that jade goody , good and bad , represents all of england .
she does n't even represent all of her neighbourhood .
i understand some of the feelings associated with this incident , but to think that england is essentially retreating into social cannibalism is plain dumb .
lets keep some perspective .
van martin , london , england jane goody would not exist if we did not create her and now we are upset with what we created .
big brother is a shameful programme anyway but its the sort of rubbish most of us seem to demand .
of course we ought to scared of shilpa shetty but our only consolation should be that educated and polite people like her would be too disgusted to want to live in britain anyway .
adrian baron , kinsgtown , st. vincent and the grenadines i disapprove heartily of the way jade is reported to have behaved in the house , but i would stop short of drawing conclusions about british society from it , much as i would stop short of drawing conclusions about india from the ludicrous effigy burning scenes we witnessed .
tris , uk in recognition of the distinctly british attitude and values shilpa showed when tolerating ms goody and co 's abuse , why do n't we award her an honorary british citizenship ?
it would definitely help repair the damage to our international reputation abroad and set a benchmark for us back at home !
piers register , united kingdom i believe that the vast majority of the british people are civilised and decent , and their reaction to this incident confirms that .
but we should not be in denial about racist and such discriminatory attitudes existing in our societies -lrb- including in india -rrb- , and should do what is necessary to combat them .
that would be especially important in our increasingly multi-ethnic societies .
padma , india i had lived in watford for the past fourteen months and had seen the reality show .
there is no need for shilpa or for that matter any indian to feel offended as this is a show wherein each contestant tries to bully the other .
if shilpa felt offended she should have walked out of the show and if goody really meant what she meant , she was just ill informed .
the media also did not have better story to cover and they are highlighting an irrelevant issue .
shiva subramanya , india i agree with mr danahar about the indian reaction but the parallels between ms goody and shilpa shetty are few and far between .
ms goody represents the worst of modern britain whereas ms shetty represents something of the best that modern india has to offer .
we should remember that no nation is perfect .
if ms goody 's so called career is now at end however , britain will have taken a step in that direction .
pankaj , uk while ms goody 's comments are deplorable , she has expressed sincere -lrb- i hope -rrb- regrets in the course of her interview .
maybe it is time everybody put this behind them and look forward .
chandra ram , india the producers carefully crafted this conflict .
make no mistake , the black gentleman on the show is well educated and mannered too , but the white participants seem to have been rounded up at a local pub .
the demographic on the show is not representational , or fair , it is just constructed to incite .
i 've travelled to india and it is one of the " best read " nations in the world , but not everyone is well mannered and well read in india either .
if you put an uneducated indian on the show , they would potentially make ignorant statements as well .
maybe ms goody could n't afford private schooling as the " average " english speaking indian can .
i am curious from which source mr. danahar quotes this fact .
brett , japan i realised a long time ago , that when a person is insecure or does n't like herself , then instead of trying to be a better person , it is easier to bring others down to her level .
vashti bowlah , trinidad , west indies sure , britain is a long way from eradicating racism but no one should get any praise out of this entire episode .
sympathy for shilpa , may be .
abhijit rajan , india -lrb- resident of us -rrb- i do n't believe british people have anything to find scary about a large pool of possible immigrants who are well educated , speak english and have a desire to succeed .
coming from canada a country that has more than 20 % of its population foreign born i can say that immigrants contribute their fair share to society .
justin acton , edinburgh uk while there may be some individuals who are racist in britain , it 's not the institutionalised racism that exists in india .
steve , usa shilpa shetty is not a b-grade actress .
only she is n't the top most one .
i do n't think jade goody 's celebrity stature ever matched shilpa shetty 's .
shilpa shetty is a ' star ' , much more than what this article suggests .
anurag , india jade goody and shilpa shetty are a class apart in more ways than one .
mamta srivastava , canada a well written article .
paul danahar has understood india better and its people even better .
today 's india is poised for growth and development .
such acts will be seen as a non-issue but there are many in india who still feel britain is a racist society and this has added fuel to it .
paul belson , india superbly said , i could not agree more .
what jade highlighted in her diatribes last week was the presence , on every corner of our once sacred green land of shakespeare , chaucer , brunel and churchill , of an increasingly ignorant , spoilt , junk-food eating , anti-social , booze-worshipping , mtv ipod generation of young people that do not know the meaning of a hard day 's work .
since the uk lost all its heavy industry in the 80s the offspring of the working class has turned into an underclass .
ironically it takes something so representative of this useless generation - big brother , for us to realise this .
richard loach , canada finally , a balanced comment on modern british ignorance .
i do n't mean the allegedly -lrb- or perhaps actually -rrb- racist remarks - i did not follow the big brother story , because big brother is rubbish .
i mean mr danahar 's pointed comment that ' your average english-speaking indian ... is a lot better educated than your average english person ' .
sadly , my experience tends rather to support this claim .
many of the younger -lrb- and not-so-young -rrb- generation in britain seem to think ignorance a virtue , and boorishness a substitute for thought .
let 's hope that this ' many ' is in fact a minority , but i have my doubts .
d fear , germany i currently run a project scaling up an india supplier .
they have etiquette and expertise .
technically they are educated to a better standard , higher motivation and a strong willingness to learn .
i worry for the uk as the standard of graduate is generally poor .
inability to spell , add up or tackle difficult tasks are evidence of the successive failings of our pass rate driven education system .
the manners and etiquette ?
liberalisation of society has handed rights to child and handcuffed the teacher .
rights may well be fundamental but they also need maturity and intelligence to be exercised responsibly .
gareth knowling , uk considering the state of moral and cultural decay of our european societies , it is not unlikely that within 10 or 20 years we shall be polishing the shoes of our indians and chinese masters .
i am inclined to think that we shall deserve it .
jean-bernard brisset , france india does n't have a chip on its shoulder ? ?
carl , nottingham , uk shilpa may be a b class actor but she handled herself like an first class human being .
dorothy green , us jade goody represents everything that is wrong with this country .
she is a cringe worthy example of someone in the public eye that sends out wrong messages to many young people here and abroad .
her lack of education and culture does nothing to our country 's image .
ann k , uk sorry for being a pain but i was annoyed by some inaccuracies in this article .
just thought that you might like to know that shilpa shetty is a critically acclaimed actress and if you would look at the list of the top indian actresses you would probably put her fifth on this .
i am no ' fan boy ' but she is definitely not on anything other than the a-list in terms of celebrity status in india .
therefore , saying that she is an indian b-grade celebrity is not nice , rather just insulting looking at her talent and dignity in bad situations , and you just can not compare her to jade goody in any way .
all i ask is that you research on your subject before writing , please !

an election monitoring group said the radicals had taken 28.5 % of the vote , but they are not expected to find partners to form a governing coalition .
the pro-eu democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- and democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- were credited with 22 % and 17 % respectively .
eu foreign ministers are meeting in brussels to discuss the bloc 's ties with belgrade and the future of kosovo .
" the majority voted for forces that are democratic and pro-european , " said javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , as he arrived .
" i hope very much there will be a speedy formation of a government that will be on the line of pro-european forces " .
serbia 's electoral commission said turnout was about 62 % of the 6.6 million eligible voters .
' vicious campaign ' after the first projections were announced , the srs candidate for prime minister , tomislav nikolic , said : " we have won as we had expected . "
" despite running against the parties led by the prime minister and the president -lrb- boris tadic -rrb- and their vicious campaigns against us , we proved our strength , " mr nikolic said . "
we have been the bridge between europe and serbia , people see us as that party , and it explains our results " bozidar djelic democratic party candidate for prime minister democrats seek close eu ties he called for the resignation of president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica , who both campaigned for closer ties with the european union .
the bbc 's jonny dymond in belgrade says the srs will not be part of any new government because there is no major party that will go into coalition with them .
mr nikolic 's group will once again sit on the sidelines whilst more moderate parties struggle with serbia 's many challenges , our correspondent adds .
his party fought a strongly anti-western campaign .
its leader , vojislav seselj , is on trial for war crimes at the un tribunal in the hague .
the srs ruled former yugoslavia for part of the 1990s in coalition with the socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- of the late leader slobodan milosevic .
possible kingmaker prime minister kostunica , who heads the conservative dss , brushed away speculation on who will form a coalition with whom .

president tadic " will have to find a man who will be able to get a majority " in the parliament , he added .
mr kostunica could end up playing kingmaker , analysts say , by striking a deal to remain prime minister with other parties .
a slew of smaller parties won the remainder of the vote , serbia 's centre for free election and democracy said .
reformists g17 plus won 6.8 % , the sps took 5.9 % , and the liberal democratic party 5.3 % .
four other parties were forecast to win a handful of parliamentary seats .
mr tadic , who leads the ds , said he hoped the outcome would produce a government capable of major reforms .
correspondents say the main issues facing the next government include economic reforms , membership talks with the eu - currently stalled over co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague - and kosovo .
the mostly-ethnic albanian region is legally a province of serbia but is under un administration .
the un 's chief envoy for the province is expected next month to recommend some form of independence - something the srs vehemently opposes .
the other main parties have proposed wide autonomy for kosovo within serbia .
this has been the country 's first general election since its union with montenegro was dissolved last year .
