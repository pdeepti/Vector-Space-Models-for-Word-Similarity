the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured . " the nuclear reactor shut down automatically as soon as it was disconnected from the power grid , " said ivo banek , a spokesman for plant owner vattenfall europe .
" it looked more dramatic than it really was . " green concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting out the blaze the state of schleswig-holstein 's nuclear regulatory agency disclosed that a second vattenfall nuclear site had been shut down some two hours earlier .
the other plant , at brunsbüttel , west of hamburg , had to be idled because of an overload . banek said this was caused by a short-circuit in a switching unit . the share price of vattenfall europe , which owns both plants , remained steady on the frankfurt stock market . experts from the environmental organization greenpeace immediately visited the krümmel reactor with a geiger counter . " our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .
" it is simply irresponsible to ignore such safety lapses as the nuclear lobby does . " meanwhile , schleswig-holstein 's social democrat interior minister ralf stegner reiterated his party 's determination to continue pursuing their course of nuclear phase-out . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 .

he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .
21 , there were the words of the man of la mancha in my ears : ' this was the impossible dream ! '
was it really true that henry had been confirmed as secretary of state , the first jew , the first foreign-born , our son ? " return to german roots two years later , having reached the pinnacle of american political power , henry returns to fürth with his parents , who had last seen their home when they were forced to flee . " this city has always remained close to my heart , " wrote louis kissinger in a letter to the mayor of fürth . it is former chancellor helmut schmidt , whose path collided with kissinger 's tenure as us secretary of state , who has the last word in kurz 's film .
" he understood and convinced other world leaders that the germans after 1945 had learned their lesson and could be trusted , " he said .
" we have this man to thank for that .
henry kissinger never forgot his german roots . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable .

its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit .

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .

" you ca n't question what was agreed upon after such a dramatic summit , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's latest comments are likely to further antagonize eu neighbors and reinforce warsaw 's image as an unpredictable partner . polish president lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin brother , horrified eu leaders recently when he spoke of the horrors of nazi germany 's occupation of poland during world war two to bolster poland 's demands at the brussels summit . poland 's relations with germany , in particular , have cooled considerably since its tough negotiating stance in brussels . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .
in 2000 , a similar link was opened between copenhagen and the southern swedish city of malmo .
negotiations over financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what the bridge will look like the project has been in the pipeline for some 15 years but has been delayed largely by protracted negotiations over financing .
although supporters of the project argue that the bridge will be an economic boost to both countries , denmark announced it would be willing to foot the entire bill after germany consistently expressed reservations . denmark will now be contributing 4.8 billion euros towards the project and would carry out most of the construction , tiefensee said at friday 's press conference .
germany 's part will consist of linking the bridge to its existing transport infrastructure . ferry operators in the german states of schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg feared business would suffer , while green groups voiced concerns about the environmental impact . the german association for environmental protection -lrb- nabu -rrb- said the project would be unable to proceed without the support of other authorities such as the office for environmental protection .

critics accuse him of being politically weak .
he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .
31 , 2006 .
he hands over his post to slovakia 's miroslav lajcak on july 1 , 2007 . dw-world.de : as the high representative to bosnia and herzegovina , you have been overseeing the dayton agreement since jan .
31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .
unfortunately , the german eu presidency did n't campaign very strongly .
but i really would have liked to have carried on . when you look back at your time in office : what is at the top of the list in your per sonal per formance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will bosnia look like when they 're adults ?
we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .

critics accuse him of being politically weak .
he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .
31 , 2006 .
he hands over his post to slovakia 's miroslav lajcak on july 1 , 2007 . dw-world.de : as the high representative to bosnia and herzegovina , you have been overseeing the dayton agreement since jan .
31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .
unfortunately , the german eu presidency did n't campaign very strongly .
but i really would have liked to have carried on . when you look back at your time in office : what is at the top of the list in your per sonal per formance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will bosnia look like when they 're adults ?
we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the future is now internet -pipe- 29.06.2007 the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the internet revolution really altered our everyday lives ?
it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .

it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured .

police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured .

the shelters can withstand attacks , as well as the increasingly violent weather . call it a storm or fall-out shelter , or just an old-fashioned german air-raid bunker .
but the government-approved gartenschutzraum or backyard shelter is just the thing for suburbanites who are tired of japanese fishponds and garden gnomes . sales of these contraptions have skyrocketed this summer after the federal disaster relief office announced it had approved the shelters following four years of rigorous testing . the manufacturer , abc guard safety systems of hanover , said the underground shelters could withstand nuclear , biological or chemical arms attacks in addition to providing protection against the increasingly violent weather in central europe . unusually severe summer thunderstorms , which have spawned tornadoes and torrential rains , have boosted sales .
once almost unknown here , tornadoes have become increasingly prevalent in recent years .
dozens of people have been hit by lightning across germany so far this summer , and half a dozen were killed by lightning bolts . is germany suffering from a climate of angst ? in a country where severe weather is rare , the recent spate of violent storms during the past two summers has unsettled germans .
surveys show over 70 per cent of germans are convinced the climate is changing for the worse and that the weather will get more extreme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent storms are increasingly hitting germany then there are those nagging reports of rising crime rates .
tabloid television in germany is full of reports of stalkers laying siege to innocent homeowners , reminiscent of the plot of the 2002 hollywood movie " panic room " about a woman hidden in her basement shelter as a maniac stalks her . factor in the growing fear of terrorist attacks , and you have a climate of angst that has germans wondering if their immaculate backyards are as safe as they ought to be . abc 's company engineer oliver langwich said the pre-fab panic room - with the marketing slogan " you can depend on absolute security made in germany " - was something of a sign of the times in post-unification germany . " the cold war is over , " langwich told the magazine wirtschaftswoche .
" but the war on terror is increasingly making the world an unsafe place and there is talk of a new cold war or even nuclear confrontation . " in addition , climate change was fuelling fears of natural disasters . " modern and safe protection ' made in germany ' is our answer to all that , " he said .
" we have found a market niche . " status symbol has its price then there is the status factor .
everybody has a zen rock garden or a koi fish pond .
but who has a pre-fabricated bunker with an air-lock entrance and reinforced concrete walls 30 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- thick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a koi fish pond is nothing unusual anymore the manufacturer said its satisfied customers include well-heeled professionals , such as lawyers and doctors .
this increased the social status factor even further . one does need to be a bit well-heeled to buy one , after all .
the starting price for the basic model is 89,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- , which includes delivery and installation . if you want a shelter with a door that will withstand a mortar shell , the price goes up to 119,000 euros . there 's room for seven the portable shelter is a steel cube fitted with an air purification system and a hand-driven generator .
it can be transported on a truck and installed within a week . " it has storage space for foodstuffs and water so that up to seven people could survive inside for up to a month , " langwich said . the container in the basic version is six by 2.5 meters -lrb- 20 by eight feet -rrb- , surrounded by 30 centimeters of reinforced concrete .
concrete steps lead down over four meters below the earth to the air-lock entrance to the shelter . optionally , you can have an underground tunnel direct from your cellar to the shelter , preventing the need to go outdoors when , say , a tornado is heading straight for your house . in case disaster debris blocks that main entrance , there is also an emergency escape hatch at the rear of the shelter . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics accuse him of being politically weak .
he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .
31 , 2006 .
he hands over his post to slovakia 's miroslav lajcak on july 1 , 2007 . dw-world.de : as the high representative to bosnia and herzegovina , you have been overseeing the dayton agreement since jan .
31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .
unfortunately , the german eu presidency did n't campaign very strongly .
but i really would have liked to have carried on . when you look back at your time in office : what is at the top of the list in your per sonal per formance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will bosnia look like when they 're adults ?
we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .
and he should make it clear to europe from the beginning that the decision to close the office next year should be tied to certain conditions .
these should be formulated now and not shortly before . ina rottscheidt interviewed christian schwarz-schilling -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics accuse him of being politically weak .
he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .

31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .
unfortunately , the german eu presidency did n't campaign very strongly .
but i really would have liked to have carried on . when you look back at your time in office : what is at the top of the list in your per sonal per formance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will bosnia look like when they 're adults ?
we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .

critics accuse him of being politically weak .
he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .
31 , 2006 .
he hands over his post to slovakia 's miroslav lajcak on july 1 , 2007 . dw-world.de : as the high representative to bosnia and herzegovina , you have been overseeing the dayton agreement since jan .
31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .

everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .

not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”

in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .

the shelters can withstand attacks , as well as the increasingly violent weather . call it a storm or fall-out shelter , or just an old-fashioned german air-raid bunker .
but the government-approved gartenschutzraum or backyard shelter is just the thing for suburbanites who are tired of japanese fishponds and garden gnomes . sales of these contraptions have skyrocketed this summer after the federal disaster relief office announced it had approved the shelters following four years of rigorous testing . the manufacturer , abc guard safety systems of hanover , said the underground shelters could withstand nuclear , biological or chemical arms attacks in addition to providing protection against the increasingly violent weather in central europe . unusually severe summer thunderstorms , which have spawned tornadoes and torrential rains , have boosted sales .
once almost unknown here , tornadoes have become increasingly prevalent in recent years .
dozens of people have been hit by lightning across germany so far this summer , and half a dozen were killed by lightning bolts . is germany suffering from a climate of angst ? in a country where severe weather is rare , the recent spate of violent storms during the past two summers has unsettled germans .
surveys show over 70 per cent of germans are convinced the climate is changing for the worse and that the weather will get more extreme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent storms are increasingly hitting germany then there are those nagging reports of rising crime rates .
tabloid television in germany is full of reports of stalkers laying siege to innocent homeowners , reminiscent of the plot of the 2002 hollywood movie " panic room " about a woman hidden in her basement shelter as a maniac stalks her . factor in the growing fear of terrorist attacks , and you have a climate of angst that has germans wondering if their immaculate backyards are as safe as they ought to be . abc 's company engineer oliver langwich said the pre-fab panic room - with the marketing slogan " you can depend on absolute security made in germany " - was something of a sign of the times in post-unification germany . " the cold war is over , " langwich told the magazine wirtschaftswoche .
" but the war on terror is increasingly making the world an unsafe place and there is talk of a new cold war or even nuclear confrontation . " in addition , climate change was fuelling fears of natural disasters . " modern and safe protection ' made in germany ' is our answer to all that , " he said .
" we have found a market niche . " status symbol has its price then there is the status factor .
everybody has a zen rock garden or a koi fish pond .
but who has a pre-fabricated bunker with an air-lock entrance and reinforced concrete walls 30 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- thick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a koi fish pond is nothing unusual anymore the manufacturer said its satisfied customers include well-heeled professionals , such as lawyers and doctors .
this increased the social status factor even further . one does need to be a bit well-heeled to buy one , after all .
the starting price for the basic model is 89,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- , which includes delivery and installation . if you want a shelter with a door that will withstand a mortar shell , the price goes up to 119,000 euros . there 's room for seven the portable shelter is a steel cube fitted with an air purification system and a hand-driven generator .
it can be transported on a truck and installed within a week . " it has storage space for foodstuffs and water so that up to seven people could survive inside for up to a month , " langwich said . the container in the basic version is six by 2.5 meters -lrb- 20 by eight feet -rrb- , surrounded by 30 centimeters of reinforced concrete .
concrete steps lead down over four meters below the earth to the air-lock entrance to the shelter . optionally , you can have an underground tunnel direct from your cellar to the shelter , preventing the need to go outdoors when , say , a tornado is heading straight for your house . in case disaster debris blocks that main entrance , there is also an emergency escape hatch at the rear of the shelter . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured . " the nuclear reactor shut down automatically as soon as it was disconnected from the power grid , " said ivo banek , a spokesman for plant owner vattenfall europe .
" it looked more dramatic than it really was . " green concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting out the blaze the state of schleswig-holstein 's nuclear regulatory agency disclosed that a second vattenfall nuclear site had been shut down some two hours earlier .
the other plant , at brunsbüttel , west of hamburg , had to be idled because of an overload . banek said this was caused by a short-circuit in a switching unit . the share price of vattenfall europe , which owns both plants , remained steady on the frankfurt stock market . experts from the environmental organization greenpeace immediately visited the krümmel reactor with a geiger counter . " our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .
" it is simply irresponsible to ignore such safety lapses as the nuclear lobby does . " meanwhile , schleswig-holstein 's social democrat interior minister ralf stegner reiterated his party 's determination to continue pursuing their course of nuclear phase-out . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 29.06.2007 merkel calls g8 summit , eu presidency " tremendous fun " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having a ball on top of the world in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor angela merkel reviewed the achievements of the g8 summit and germany 's eu presidency , which ends on saturday .
she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's comments sparked outrage among politicians in brussels . " i just ca n't believe it , " martin schulz , head of the social democrat group in the eu parliament told spiegel online .
" you ca n't question what was agreed upon after such a dramatic summit , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's latest comments are likely to further antagonize eu neighbors and reinforce warsaw 's image as an unpredictable partner . polish president lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin brother , horrified eu leaders recently when he spoke of the horrors of nazi germany 's occupation of poland during world war two to bolster poland 's demands at the brussels summit . poland 's relations with germany , in particular , have cooled considerably since its tough negotiating stance in brussels . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .
21 , there were the words of the man of la mancha in my ears : ' this was the impossible dream ! '
was it really true that henry had been confirmed as secretary of state , the first jew , the first foreign-born , our son ? " return to german roots two years later , having reached the pinnacle of american political power , henry returns to fürth with his parents , who had last seen their home when they were forced to flee . " this city has always remained close to my heart , " wrote louis kissinger in a letter to the mayor of fürth . it is former chancellor helmut schmidt , whose path collided with kissinger 's tenure as us secretary of state , who has the last word in kurz 's film .

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis .

" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .

" his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .
21 , there were the words of the man of la mancha in my ears : ' this was the impossible dream ! '
was it really true that henry had been confirmed as secretary of state , the first jew , the first foreign-born , our son ? " return to german roots two years later , having reached the pinnacle of american political power , henry returns to fürth with his parents , who had last seen their home when they were forced to flee . " this city has always remained close to my heart , " wrote louis kissinger in a letter to the mayor of fürth . it is former chancellor helmut schmidt , whose path collided with kissinger 's tenure as us secretary of state , who has the last word in kurz 's film .
" he understood and convinced other world leaders that the germans after 1945 had learned their lesson and could be trusted , " he said .
" we have this man to thank for that .

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable .

its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 29.06.2007 merkel calls g8 summit , eu presidency " tremendous fun " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having a ball on top of the world in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor angela merkel reviewed the achievements of the g8 summit and germany 's eu presidency , which ends on saturday .
she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .

there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .

it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this .

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's comments sparked outrage among politicians in brussels . " i just ca n't believe it , " martin schulz , head of the social democrat group in the eu parliament told spiegel online .
" you ca n't question what was agreed upon after such a dramatic summit , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's latest comments are likely to further antagonize eu neighbors and reinforce warsaw 's image as an unpredictable partner . polish president lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin brother , horrified eu leaders recently when he spoke of the horrors of nazi germany 's occupation of poland during world war two to bolster poland 's demands at the brussels summit . poland 's relations with germany , in particular , have cooled considerably since its tough negotiating stance in brussels . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .
21 , there were the words of the man of la mancha in my ears : ' this was the impossible dream ! '
was it really true that henry had been confirmed as secretary of state , the first jew , the first foreign-born , our son ? " return to german roots two years later , having reached the pinnacle of american political power , henry returns to fürth with his parents , who had last seen their home when they were forced to flee . " this city has always remained close to my heart , " wrote louis kissinger in a letter to the mayor of fürth . it is former chancellor helmut schmidt , whose path collided with kissinger 's tenure as us secretary of state , who has the last word in kurz 's film .
" he understood and convinced other world leaders that the germans after 1945 had learned their lesson and could be trusted , " he said .
" we have this man to thank for that .

police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured .

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured . " the nuclear reactor shut down automatically as soon as it was disconnected from the power grid , " said ivo banek , a spokesman for plant owner vattenfall europe .

" our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the future is now internet -pipe- 29.06.2007 the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the internet revolution really altered our everyday lives ?
it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .

we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the future is now internet -pipe- 29.06.2007 the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the internet revolution really altered our everyday lives ?
it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .

-lrb- 28.06.2007 -rrb- " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " according to tim o ’ reilly , the founder of o ’ reilly media and a major proponent of the web 2.0 movement , the concept of artificial intelligence will become a reality .
in many ways , he says , it is already here .
-lrb- 27.06.2007 -rrb- the future is now the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life .

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured . " the nuclear reactor shut down automatically as soon as it was disconnected from the power grid , " said ivo banek , a spokesman for plant owner vattenfall europe .
" it looked more dramatic than it really was . " green concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting out the blaze the state of schleswig-holstein 's nuclear regulatory agency disclosed that a second vattenfall nuclear site had been shut down some two hours earlier .
the other plant , at brunsbüttel , west of hamburg , had to be idled because of an overload . banek said this was caused by a short-circuit in a switching unit . the share price of vattenfall europe , which owns both plants , remained steady on the frankfurt stock market . experts from the environmental organization greenpeace immediately visited the krümmel reactor with a geiger counter . " our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .
" it is simply irresponsible to ignore such safety lapses as the nuclear lobby does .

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .
in 2000 , a similar link was opened between copenhagen and the southern swedish city of malmo .
negotiations over financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what the bridge will look like the project has been in the pipeline for some 15 years but has been delayed largely by protracted negotiations over financing .
although supporters of the project argue that the bridge will be an economic boost to both countries , denmark announced it would be willing to foot the entire bill after germany consistently expressed reservations . denmark will now be contributing 4.8 billion euros towards the project and would carry out most of the construction , tiefensee said at friday 's press conference .
germany 's part will consist of linking the bridge to its existing transport infrastructure . ferry operators in the german states of schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg feared business would suffer , while green groups voiced concerns about the environmental impact . the german association for environmental protection -lrb- nabu -rrb- said the project would be unable to proceed without the support of other authorities such as the office for environmental protection . " we will be looking into every opportunity to stall this project with legal means , " said nabu ceo leif miller . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .
21 , there were the words of the man of la mancha in my ears : ' this was the impossible dream ! '
was it really true that henry had been confirmed as secretary of state , the first jew , the first foreign-born , our son ? " return to german roots two years later , having reached the pinnacle of american political power , henry returns to fürth with his parents , who had last seen their home when they were forced to flee . " this city has always remained close to my heart , " wrote louis kissinger in a letter to the mayor of fürth . it is former chancellor helmut schmidt , whose path collided with kissinger 's tenure as us secretary of state , who has the last word in kurz 's film .

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 .

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .

if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .
in 2000 , a similar link was opened between copenhagen and the southern swedish city of malmo .
negotiations over financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what the bridge will look like the project has been in the pipeline for some 15 years but has been delayed largely by protracted negotiations over financing .
although supporters of the project argue that the bridge will be an economic boost to both countries , denmark announced it would be willing to foot the entire bill after germany consistently expressed reservations . denmark will now be contributing 4.8 billion euros towards the project and would carry out most of the construction , tiefensee said at friday 's press conference .
germany 's part will consist of linking the bridge to its existing transport infrastructure . ferry operators in the german states of schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg feared business would suffer , while green groups voiced concerns about the environmental impact . the german association for environmental protection -lrb- nabu -rrb- said the project would be unable to proceed without the support of other authorities such as the office for environmental protection .

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .
21 , there were the words of the man of la mancha in my ears : ' this was the impossible dream ! '
was it really true that henry had been confirmed as secretary of state , the first jew , the first foreign-born , our son ? " return to german roots two years later , having reached the pinnacle of american political power , henry returns to fürth with his parents , who had last seen their home when they were forced to flee . " this city has always remained close to my heart , " wrote louis kissinger in a letter to the mayor of fürth . it is former chancellor helmut schmidt , whose path collided with kissinger 's tenure as us secretary of state , who has the last word in kurz 's film .
" he understood and convinced other world leaders that the germans after 1945 had learned their lesson and could be trusted , " he said .
" we have this man to thank for that .

the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the future is now internet -pipe- 29.06.2007 the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the internet revolution really altered our everyday lives ?
it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the future is now internet -pipe- 29.06.2007 the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the internet revolution really altered our everyday lives ?
it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .

-lrb- 28.06.2007 -rrb- " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " according to tim o ’ reilly , the founder of o ’ reilly media and a major proponent of the web 2.0 movement , the concept of artificial intelligence will become a reality .
in many ways , he says , it is already here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the future is now internet -pipe- 29.06.2007 the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the internet revolution really altered our everyday lives ?
it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured . " the nuclear reactor shut down automatically as soon as it was disconnected from the power grid , " said ivo banek , a spokesman for plant owner vattenfall europe .
" it looked more dramatic than it really was . " green concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting out the blaze the state of schleswig-holstein 's nuclear regulatory agency disclosed that a second vattenfall nuclear site had been shut down some two hours earlier .
the other plant , at brunsbüttel , west of hamburg , had to be idled because of an overload . banek said this was caused by a short-circuit in a switching unit . the share price of vattenfall europe , which owns both plants , remained steady on the frankfurt stock market . experts from the environmental organization greenpeace immediately visited the krümmel reactor with a geiger counter . " our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .
" it is simply irresponsible to ignore such safety lapses as the nuclear lobby does . " meanwhile , schleswig-holstein 's social democrat interior minister ralf stegner reiterated his party 's determination to continue pursuing their course of nuclear phase-out . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .
in 2000 , a similar link was opened between copenhagen and the southern swedish city of malmo .
negotiations over financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what the bridge will look like the project has been in the pipeline for some 15 years but has been delayed largely by protracted negotiations over financing .
although supporters of the project argue that the bridge will be an economic boost to both countries , denmark announced it would be willing to foot the entire bill after germany consistently expressed reservations . denmark will now be contributing 4.8 billion euros towards the project and would carry out most of the construction , tiefensee said at friday 's press conference .
germany 's part will consist of linking the bridge to its existing transport infrastructure . ferry operators in the german states of schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg feared business would suffer , while green groups voiced concerns about the environmental impact . the german association for environmental protection -lrb- nabu -rrb- said the project would be unable to proceed without the support of other authorities such as the office for environmental protection .

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .

although supporters of the project argue that the bridge will be an economic boost to both countries , denmark announced it would be willing to foot the entire bill after germany consistently expressed reservations . denmark will now be contributing 4.8 billion euros towards the project and would carry out most of the construction , tiefensee said at friday 's press conference .
germany 's part will consist of linking the bridge to its existing transport infrastructure . ferry operators in the german states of schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg feared business would suffer , while green groups voiced concerns about the environmental impact . the german association for environmental protection -lrb- nabu -rrb- said the project would be unable to proceed without the support of other authorities such as the office for environmental protection .

31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .

we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .

he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .
31 , 2006 .
he hands over his post to slovakia 's miroslav lajcak on july 1 , 2007 . dw-world.de : as the high representative to bosnia and herzegovina , you have been overseeing the dayton agreement since jan .
31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .
unfortunately , the german eu presidency did n't campaign very strongly .
but i really would have liked to have carried on . when you look back at your time in office : what is at the top of the list in your per sonal per formance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will bosnia look like when they 're adults ?
we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .
and he should make it clear to europe from the beginning that the decision to close the office next year should be tied to certain conditions .

you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .

i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .

but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics accuse him of being politically weak .
he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .
31 , 2006 .
he hands over his post to slovakia 's miroslav lajcak on july 1 , 2007 . dw-world.de : as the high representative to bosnia and herzegovina , you have been overseeing the dayton agreement since jan .
31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .
unfortunately , the german eu presidency did n't campaign very strongly .
but i really would have liked to have carried on . when you look back at your time in office : what is at the top of the list in your per sonal per formance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will bosnia look like when they 're adults ?
we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .
and he should make it clear to europe from the beginning that the decision to close the office next year should be tied to certain conditions .
these should be formulated now and not shortly before . ina rottscheidt interviewed christian schwarz-schilling -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .

when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .
21 , there were the words of the man of la mancha in my ears : ' this was the impossible dream ! '
was it really true that henry had been confirmed as secretary of state , the first jew , the first foreign-born , our son ? " return to german roots two years later , having reached the pinnacle of american political power , henry returns to fürth with his parents , who had last seen their home when they were forced to flee . " this city has always remained close to my heart , " wrote louis kissinger in a letter to the mayor of fürth . it is former chancellor helmut schmidt , whose path collided with kissinger 's tenure as us secretary of state , who has the last word in kurz 's film .
" he understood and convinced other world leaders that the germans after 1945 had learned their lesson and could be trusted , " he said .

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured . " the nuclear reactor shut down automatically as soon as it was disconnected from the power grid , " said ivo banek , a spokesman for plant owner vattenfall europe .
" it looked more dramatic than it really was . " green concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting out the blaze the state of schleswig-holstein 's nuclear regulatory agency disclosed that a second vattenfall nuclear site had been shut down some two hours earlier .
the other plant , at brunsbüttel , west of hamburg , had to be idled because of an overload . banek said this was caused by a short-circuit in a switching unit . the share price of vattenfall europe , which owns both plants , remained steady on the frankfurt stock market . experts from the environmental organization greenpeace immediately visited the krümmel reactor with a geiger counter . " our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .
" it is simply irresponsible to ignore such safety lapses as the nuclear lobby does . " meanwhile , schleswig-holstein 's social democrat interior minister ralf stegner reiterated his party 's determination to continue pursuing their course of nuclear phase-out . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured . " the nuclear reactor shut down automatically as soon as it was disconnected from the power grid , " said ivo banek , a spokesman for plant owner vattenfall europe .
" it looked more dramatic than it really was . " green concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting out the blaze the state of schleswig-holstein 's nuclear regulatory agency disclosed that a second vattenfall nuclear site had been shut down some two hours earlier .
the other plant , at brunsbüttel , west of hamburg , had to be idled because of an overload . banek said this was caused by a short-circuit in a switching unit . the share price of vattenfall europe , which owns both plants , remained steady on the frankfurt stock market . experts from the environmental organization greenpeace immediately visited the krümmel reactor with a geiger counter . " our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .
" it is simply irresponsible to ignore such safety lapses as the nuclear lobby does .

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .

how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .

we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this .

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis .

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured . " the nuclear reactor shut down automatically as soon as it was disconnected from the power grid , " said ivo banek , a spokesman for plant owner vattenfall europe .
" it looked more dramatic than it really was . " green concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting out the blaze the state of schleswig-holstein 's nuclear regulatory agency disclosed that a second vattenfall nuclear site had been shut down some two hours earlier .
the other plant , at brunsbüttel , west of hamburg , had to be idled because of an overload . banek said this was caused by a short-circuit in a switching unit . the share price of vattenfall europe , which owns both plants , remained steady on the frankfurt stock market . experts from the environmental organization greenpeace immediately visited the krümmel reactor with a geiger counter . " our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .
" it is simply irresponsible to ignore such safety lapses as the nuclear lobby does .

the public was at no point at risk , stressed the state government . the fire broke out in an ancillary area of the krümmel power station mid-afternoon , sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky east of hamburg , reported police - who said they were fielding numerous calls from alarmed locals . according to a fire brigade spokesman , more than 100 firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze . the blaze occurred when the cooling fluid of a huge transformer unit caught fire .
police did not say what the burning fluid was , but surplus heat from electrical transformers is usually conducted away with oil . the transformer complex alters the power voltage so it can be fed into the national power grid . the nuclear reactor itself did not catch fire , and no one was injured .

the other plant , at brunsbüttel , west of hamburg , had to be idled because of an overload . banek said this was caused by a short-circuit in a switching unit . the share price of vattenfall europe , which owns both plants , remained steady on the frankfurt stock market . experts from the environmental organization greenpeace immediately visited the krümmel reactor with a geiger counter . " our results showed there was no increased radioactivity , " said greenpeace spokesman thomas breuer . the vattenfall connection both plants use the water of the elbe river as a coolant and are controlled by swedish state-owned utility vattenfall . however neither is a sister plant to vattenfall 's forsmark plant , 140 kilometers -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- north of stockholm , where there have been coolant leaks in the past year . krümmel , the world 's biggest boiling-water reactor , was built in 1984 by hamburg 's municipal power company , which was later taken over by vattenfall .
it produces 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually . the plant has long been the focus of controversy , with critics holding it responsible for a high incidence of leukemia cases in the region . within the last year , 15 " incidents " at the plant were registered , making it one of the most unstable in europe . while the causes of the two incidents remain unclear , the fire in krümmel triggered angry reaction among politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer - outraged at safety lapses " i demand an immediate and comprehensive investigation of this incident , " said green party head reinhard bütikofer .

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .

" i never give interviews about my personal life , " said henry kissinger in response to a letter from germany in 2003 .
but evi kurz , the author of the recently released " the kissinger saga : two brothers from fürth , " persisted .
the book is based on kurz 's film documentary , which was aired earlier this year on german television . kurz , who is also a native of fürth , was deeply moved by a speech that kissinger gave in may 1998 when the former us secretary of state was made honorary citizen in the city of his birth , near nuremberg . " he read from a letter his mother had written to him , " said kurz , who became obsessed about interviewing kissinger , 84 , and his brother walter , 82 about their german jewish roots .
" paula kissinger wrote about her strong attachment to the city where she married and bore her two sons , the same city the family was forced to flee under the nazis . " kurz dug up a trove of old documents that impressed the brothers , and it was walter , a retired multi-millionaire businessman now living out on a ranch in colorado , who finally convinced his elder brother to commit their family history to film . life in fürth in the 1930s , nuremberg was the site of the huge annual nazi rallies , where the anti-semitic laws on racial purity were passed .
fürth , a smaller city in the shadow of nuremberg , had a good size jewish community , which had lived in harmony with their christian neighbors until the rise of adolf hitler in 1933 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kissingers had fled germany before kristallnacht - the night of broken glass " kissinger 's jewish identity deeply influences his perspective on the world .
he remembers that when the nazis came to power , the nice tolerant neighbors did nothing to protect his family , " said jeremy suri , a historian at the university of wisconsin-madison and author of " henry kissinger and the american century , " which was also released last week . kissinger 's struggle with anti-semitism " his confrontation with anti-semitism did not end when he fled germany , " said suria , who interviewed his subject several times .
" he has been traumatized by it all his life .
kissinger was always conscious of being the outsider . " although his trademark horn-rimmed spectacles and the distinctive gravely monotone marked by his place of birth have added to the kissinger mystique , he tried desperately to fit into mainstream america , according to suri . " his brother walter , who speaks english like a yank and even has trouble with german , was much better able to assimilate , " he said . henry clings more to his german heritage than walter , according to kurz . " walter wanted to be fully american , " she said .
" he wanted to leave germany behind him . " nazis come to power in one interview walter reminisces about family holidays at the grandparents ' home in leutershausen , where the children went swimming in a river .
when asked about his reaction to a sign that went up in 1933 that banned jews from the site , walter , choking back tears , quietly asks kurz to stop filming . " it was incredibly painful for walter to talk about this chapter of his life , " kurz said .
" surprisingly , it was henry , who tends to be more reticent about personal matters , who opened up . " " jewish boys my age could n't understand why we were suddenly banned or segregated from the others , who joined the hitler youth , " kissinger said in the film .
" it was much harder on my parents . " their father , louis kissinger , who taught at an all-girls preparatory school , was suddenly " relieved " of his teaching duties , but it was their mother who saw the writing on the wall . before kristallnacht , the pogrom that had left the streets littered with smashed glass in november 1938 , paula kissinger had applied for exit visas that enabled the entire family to flee before it was too late . new start in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the american dream fast forward to the orthodox jewish neighborhood washington heights in new york city . by 1943 , heinz kissinger , now known as henry , was drafted in the us army , whose division took part in the allied invasion of normandy . he then returned to the country of his birth as counterspy in the american occupational zone , while walter served in the pacific theater . by the late 1940s , both had returned to america - henry pursuing a stellar academic career at harvard university and walter going to rival princeton . kurz 's book , which publishes the family 's personal documents and photos for the first time , features a passage from paula 's diary , in which she wrote down her thoughts on the swearing in of her son as us secretary of state in 1973 . " when we started out on our trip to washington on sept .
21 , there were the words of the man of la mancha in my ears : ' this was the impossible dream ! '
was it really true that henry had been confirmed as secretary of state , the first jew , the first foreign-born , our son ? " return to german roots two years later , having reached the pinnacle of american political power , henry returns to fürth with his parents , who had last seen their home when they were forced to flee . " this city has always remained close to my heart , " wrote louis kissinger in a letter to the mayor of fürth . it is former chancellor helmut schmidt , whose path collided with kissinger 's tenure as us secretary of state , who has the last word in kurz 's film .
" he understood and convinced other world leaders that the germans after 1945 had learned their lesson and could be trusted , " he said .
" we have this man to thank for that .

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's comments sparked outrage among politicians in brussels . " i just ca n't believe it , " martin schulz , head of the social democrat group in the eu parliament told spiegel online .
" you ca n't question what was agreed upon after such a dramatic summit , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's latest comments are likely to further antagonize eu neighbors and reinforce warsaw 's image as an unpredictable partner . polish president lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin brother , horrified eu leaders recently when he spoke of the horrors of nazi germany 's occupation of poland during world war two to bolster poland 's demands at the brussels summit . poland 's relations with germany , in particular , have cooled considerably since its tough negotiating stance in brussels . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the shelters can withstand attacks , as well as the increasingly violent weather . call it a storm or fall-out shelter , or just an old-fashioned german air-raid bunker .
but the government-approved gartenschutzraum or backyard shelter is just the thing for suburbanites who are tired of japanese fishponds and garden gnomes . sales of these contraptions have skyrocketed this summer after the federal disaster relief office announced it had approved the shelters following four years of rigorous testing . the manufacturer , abc guard safety systems of hanover , said the underground shelters could withstand nuclear , biological or chemical arms attacks in addition to providing protection against the increasingly violent weather in central europe . unusually severe summer thunderstorms , which have spawned tornadoes and torrential rains , have boosted sales .
once almost unknown here , tornadoes have become increasingly prevalent in recent years .
dozens of people have been hit by lightning across germany so far this summer , and half a dozen were killed by lightning bolts . is germany suffering from a climate of angst ? in a country where severe weather is rare , the recent spate of violent storms during the past two summers has unsettled germans .
surveys show over 70 per cent of germans are convinced the climate is changing for the worse and that the weather will get more extreme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent storms are increasingly hitting germany then there are those nagging reports of rising crime rates .
tabloid television in germany is full of reports of stalkers laying siege to innocent homeowners , reminiscent of the plot of the 2002 hollywood movie " panic room " about a woman hidden in her basement shelter as a maniac stalks her . factor in the growing fear of terrorist attacks , and you have a climate of angst that has germans wondering if their immaculate backyards are as safe as they ought to be . abc 's company engineer oliver langwich said the pre-fab panic room - with the marketing slogan " you can depend on absolute security made in germany " - was something of a sign of the times in post-unification germany . " the cold war is over , " langwich told the magazine wirtschaftswoche .
" but the war on terror is increasingly making the world an unsafe place and there is talk of a new cold war or even nuclear confrontation . " in addition , climate change was fuelling fears of natural disasters . " modern and safe protection ' made in germany ' is our answer to all that , " he said .
" we have found a market niche . " status symbol has its price then there is the status factor .
everybody has a zen rock garden or a koi fish pond .
but who has a pre-fabricated bunker with an air-lock entrance and reinforced concrete walls 30 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- thick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a koi fish pond is nothing unusual anymore the manufacturer said its satisfied customers include well-heeled professionals , such as lawyers and doctors .
this increased the social status factor even further . one does need to be a bit well-heeled to buy one , after all .
the starting price for the basic model is 89,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- , which includes delivery and installation . if you want a shelter with a door that will withstand a mortar shell , the price goes up to 119,000 euros . there 's room for seven the portable shelter is a steel cube fitted with an air purification system and a hand-driven generator .
it can be transported on a truck and installed within a week . " it has storage space for foodstuffs and water so that up to seven people could survive inside for up to a month , " langwich said . the container in the basic version is six by 2.5 meters -lrb- 20 by eight feet -rrb- , surrounded by 30 centimeters of reinforced concrete .
concrete steps lead down over four meters below the earth to the air-lock entrance to the shelter . optionally , you can have an underground tunnel direct from your cellar to the shelter , preventing the need to go outdoors when , say , a tornado is heading straight for your house . in case disaster debris blocks that main entrance , there is also an emergency escape hatch at the rear of the shelter . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's comments sparked outrage among politicians in brussels . " i just ca n't believe it , " martin schulz , head of the social democrat group in the eu parliament told spiegel online .
" you ca n't question what was agreed upon after such a dramatic summit , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's latest comments are likely to further antagonize eu neighbors and reinforce warsaw 's image as an unpredictable partner . polish president lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin brother , horrified eu leaders recently when he spoke of the horrors of nazi germany 's occupation of poland during world war two to bolster poland 's demands at the brussels summit . poland 's relations with germany , in particular , have cooled considerably since its tough negotiating stance in brussels . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's comments sparked outrage among politicians in brussels . " i just ca n't believe it , " martin schulz , head of the social democrat group in the eu parliament told spiegel online .
" you ca n't question what was agreed upon after such a dramatic summit , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's latest comments are likely to further antagonize eu neighbors and reinforce warsaw 's image as an unpredictable partner . polish president lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin brother , horrified eu leaders recently when he spoke of the horrors of nazi germany 's occupation of poland during world war two to bolster poland 's demands at the brussels summit . poland 's relations with germany , in particular , have cooled considerably since its tough negotiating stance in brussels . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics accuse him of being politically weak .
he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .
31 , 2006 .
he hands over his post to slovakia 's miroslav lajcak on july 1 , 2007 . dw-world.de : as the high representative to bosnia and herzegovina , you have been overseeing the dayton agreement since jan .
31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .
unfortunately , the german eu presidency did n't campaign very strongly .
but i really would have liked to have carried on . when you look back at your time in office : what is at the top of the list in your per sonal per formance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will bosnia look like when they 're adults ?
we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .
and he should make it clear to europe from the beginning that the decision to close the office next year should be tied to certain conditions .
these should be formulated now and not shortly before . ina rottscheidt interviewed christian schwarz-schilling -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics accuse him of being politically weak .
he told his side in an interview with dw-world.de. germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , took over as the international community 's high representative for bosnia and herzegovina on jan .
31 , 2006 .
he hands over his post to slovakia 's miroslav lajcak on july 1 , 2007 . dw-world.de : as the high representative to bosnia and herzegovina , you have been overseeing the dayton agreement since jan .
31 , 2006 .
you can remove politicians from office and revise laws .
but critics have accused you of political weakness .
why did n't you make use of your powers , such as your predecessor paddy ashdown , who removed some 60 bosnian dignitaries from office ? christian schwarz-schilling : when i took over this mandate , the entire international community called on me to give the bosnians more individual responsibility .
we wanted to leave the country at the beginning of 2007 .
but how can you pull out when the people have never learned to take on their own responsibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's paddy ashdown was more forceful in bosnia it 's true that i did n't lay anyone off because i do n't consider that an effective method .
and the heads grow back like a hydra .
i carried out institutional changes through legal amendments or implemented tax allocation .
i did a great deal that just did n't have a very high publicity effect . i continue to stand by this .
the bosnians had to recognize that personal responsibility is n't easy and the international community had to learn what the reality is here .
everyone thought everything was fine and that the formulas for compromise from above , which had n't even properly arrived at the bottom , were now functioning .
they did n't even see that they only function because the high representative enforces them with his power . ten years ago , the dayton agreement divided the country into two entities : republika srpska and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
the good intention of the international community was behind this , which was paraphrased as " three peoples , two entities , one nation . "
but was it also the cornerstone for a viable country named bosnia and herzegovina ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wounds of war are still fresh no , dayton was only the ending of the genocide and the war between the individual parts of the former yugoslavia .
the reorganization at the time , which only regulated the international administration , was never a true constitution , as there were various constitutions on the level of the entities as well as on the state level .
but dayton was n't created for that purpose .
rather , it was supposed to be the beginning .
it created the possibility for improvements .
but they could only proceed sluggishly as the consensus of all three states was necessary . does this construction make sense or should this coo per ation be questioned in principle ? the concept was ailing from the beginning , as many in the international community thought that this dayton agreement could create a modern nation .
the decisive error was that the entities had very different functions , drifted apart and the national level was developed far too weakly .
for me , a sustainable country is not feasible without a decisive constitutional reform .
it has to bring these various levels together , bringing about a meaningful form of government and , also in this sense , then compatible for the corresponding substructures , i.e. the entities . you often criticized those politicians " driven by per sonal ambition " who were trying to shatter the constitutional legal framework and territorial order of bosnia and herzegovina .
are you surrendering ? no , not at all .
i would have gladly been prepared to continue my work under certain conditions .
but the international community was of the opinion that a political change could push things forward .
unfortunately , the german eu presidency did n't campaign very strongly .
but i really would have liked to have carried on . when you look back at your time in office : what is at the top of the list in your per sonal per formance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will bosnia look like when they 're adults ?
we pushed forward a lot of things .
but the most important thing is that the truth became a bit more visible : that bosnia is not in a position to carry responsibility on its own to the degree that we can close the office of the high representative .
either the high representative has to stay on for one or several years , in order to effectively lead the country to taking personal responsibility , or europe has to take on this role from the international community and see to the security here .
but europe is not willing to do this at the moment ; or rather europe believes that bosnia is a completely normal country where you just have to wait until it 's ready . that is an error .
bosnia had a unique fate - with genocide , refugees and many dead - like in no other european country after world war ii .
for this reason , we ca n't say : we 'll treat bosnia like any other country .
that was n't done with germany , either .
we did n't learn democracy and free government in five years , either . what advice do you have for your successor , slovakia 's miroslav lajcak ? i would advise him to consider the situation of this country in his decisions with consistency , but also with great understanding .
and he should make it clear to europe from the beginning that the decision to close the office next year should be tied to certain conditions .

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .

the shelters can withstand attacks , as well as the increasingly violent weather . call it a storm or fall-out shelter , or just an old-fashioned german air-raid bunker .
but the government-approved gartenschutzraum or backyard shelter is just the thing for suburbanites who are tired of japanese fishponds and garden gnomes . sales of these contraptions have skyrocketed this summer after the federal disaster relief office announced it had approved the shelters following four years of rigorous testing . the manufacturer , abc guard safety systems of hanover , said the underground shelters could withstand nuclear , biological or chemical arms attacks in addition to providing protection against the increasingly violent weather in central europe . unusually severe summer thunderstorms , which have spawned tornadoes and torrential rains , have boosted sales .
once almost unknown here , tornadoes have become increasingly prevalent in recent years .
dozens of people have been hit by lightning across germany so far this summer , and half a dozen were killed by lightning bolts . is germany suffering from a climate of angst ? in a country where severe weather is rare , the recent spate of violent storms during the past two summers has unsettled germans .
surveys show over 70 per cent of germans are convinced the climate is changing for the worse and that the weather will get more extreme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent storms are increasingly hitting germany then there are those nagging reports of rising crime rates .
tabloid television in germany is full of reports of stalkers laying siege to innocent homeowners , reminiscent of the plot of the 2002 hollywood movie " panic room " about a woman hidden in her basement shelter as a maniac stalks her . factor in the growing fear of terrorist attacks , and you have a climate of angst that has germans wondering if their immaculate backyards are as safe as they ought to be . abc 's company engineer oliver langwich said the pre-fab panic room - with the marketing slogan " you can depend on absolute security made in germany " - was something of a sign of the times in post-unification germany . " the cold war is over , " langwich told the magazine wirtschaftswoche .
" but the war on terror is increasingly making the world an unsafe place and there is talk of a new cold war or even nuclear confrontation . " in addition , climate change was fuelling fears of natural disasters . " modern and safe protection ' made in germany ' is our answer to all that , " he said .
" we have found a market niche . " status symbol has its price then there is the status factor .
everybody has a zen rock garden or a koi fish pond .
but who has a pre-fabricated bunker with an air-lock entrance and reinforced concrete walls 30 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- thick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a koi fish pond is nothing unusual anymore the manufacturer said its satisfied customers include well-heeled professionals , such as lawyers and doctors .
this increased the social status factor even further . one does need to be a bit well-heeled to buy one , after all .
the starting price for the basic model is 89,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- , which includes delivery and installation . if you want a shelter with a door that will withstand a mortar shell , the price goes up to 119,000 euros . there 's room for seven the portable shelter is a steel cube fitted with an air purification system and a hand-driven generator .
it can be transported on a truck and installed within a week . " it has storage space for foodstuffs and water so that up to seven people could survive inside for up to a month , " langwich said . the container in the basic version is six by 2.5 meters -lrb- 20 by eight feet -rrb- , surrounded by 30 centimeters of reinforced concrete .
concrete steps lead down over four meters below the earth to the air-lock entrance to the shelter . optionally , you can have an underground tunnel direct from your cellar to the shelter , preventing the need to go outdoors when , say , a tornado is heading straight for your house . in case disaster debris blocks that main entrance , there is also an emergency escape hatch at the rear of the shelter . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .
it is expected that motorists will be charged a toll fee to use the bridge with the aim of recovering the costs of the project within 25 years .
the bridge is expected to cost some 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.43 billion -rrb- .
in 2000 , a similar link was opened between copenhagen and the southern swedish city of malmo .
negotiations over financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what the bridge will look like the project has been in the pipeline for some 15 years but has been delayed largely by protracted negotiations over financing .
although supporters of the project argue that the bridge will be an economic boost to both countries , denmark announced it would be willing to foot the entire bill after germany consistently expressed reservations . denmark will now be contributing 4.8 billion euros towards the project and would carry out most of the construction , tiefensee said at friday 's press conference .
germany 's part will consist of linking the bridge to its existing transport infrastructure . ferry operators in the german states of schleswig-holstein and mecklenburg feared business would suffer , while green groups voiced concerns about the environmental impact . the german association for environmental protection -lrb- nabu -rrb- said the project would be unable to proceed without the support of other authorities such as the office for environmental protection .

she 's ready for a vacation and the challenges ahead . dw-tv : chancellor merkel - six months of the eu presidency , the g8 summit in heiligendamm , marathon negotiations in brussels .
with all of that behind you , are you happy to be going on holiday ? angela merkel : well , first of all , i am happy about what we have achieved during our presidency .
it 's been an incredibly exciting time - but also very challenging .
not just i , but all of the members of the cabinet , have gained new insights , have worked very hard , and have worked together very well . but of course , after such hard work , the prospect of a few days ' holiday is n't bad .
but this period has been tremendous fun . you have been celebrated politically as " miss world , " your negotiation skills have been praised at home and abroad .
how satisfied are you per sonally with the results of the last few months ? i , personally , am very satisfied .
through all of these negotiations , we have learned time and again that we have so many friends , partners , and supporters .
in the g8 , and in the european union - with its 27 member states - you can not achieve anything on your own , if the others do n't believe that the time is right to reach certain decisions .
without that , you are lost .
but that was never the case , and that was the most important experience for me . bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , eu commission president jose barroso and merkel after last week 's eu summit in brussels .
germany hands over the eu presidency to portugal on sunday . the eu and the g8 both understand that a lot of things are changing in the world , and that if we want to realize our interests , if you want to be the world leaders in certain fields , then we have to present a united front . that 's something i will never forget , because that is what generates the strength to solve new problems . with all these things on the agenda - the reform of the eu constitution , getting that process started again , climate protection , aid for africa - there must be some areas where you had hoped to achieve more .
which are they ? well , it is of course the case that as europeans , for example , we had much more ambitious goals for the g8 .
but the main thing for me is not to say where i - or others - hoped to achieve more , and others wanted less . the main point that fills me with such satisfaction is that all these people came from different positions and the final outcome - both in the european council and at the g8 summit - was achieved through personal meetings .
it would n't have been possible through video-conferencing ! bildunterschrift : it 's easier to talk when everyone sits in the same beach chair it 's those personal meetings that create a climate in which one can say : " even though we have different opinions , we have to find some common ground , everyone has to be willing to compromise . "
and i do n't then start nagging about what i have had to give up , or not .
together we made progress overall - and that 's what counts for me . let 's just stay for a moment with this compromise that the eu created for itself .
it 's a very complicated body of rules that allows individual states to work together .
but wo n't it lead to different member states developing at different speeds - that one group of countries wanting greater integration will move ahead ? this new treaty means that in the eu , the european parliament as a legislative body now has equal rights - or almost equal rights - with the european council .
the commission has the right to propose legislation .
now you have to remember that in the commission , there are 27 commissioners , one from each member state .
the european parliament has members from all the eu nations .
and the treaty provides a basis for us to agree things , even when some member states are not joining in straight away .
that 's how it is with the euro , for example . and it will be the case on domestic and justice policy in future ... the option will exist for some member states to put on the brakes and say : " we 're not going along with this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv 's christian f. trippe with chancellor merkel but what we ca n't allow is for that to lead to different groups of countries doing other things beyond the terms of the treaty - because that would mean the removal of parliamentary control .
i ca n't send out half of the members of the european parliament when a vote is taking place , just because they do n't belong to the group of countries that want to do something together . so that means that we need a joint contract that lays down the rules - and if we want to vote on things together , then we need to know what those rules are .
and you ca n't then form two groups that do things differently .
so there may be certain points where there is a " two-track europe " - but that can never be the answer to the question of how europe can develop further . if you want to fight climate change , represent europe 's interests at world trade talks , protect intellectual property - you can only do all that as one european union , and not at two different speeds . frau merkel - after the summer recess , international politics will be a little lower on the agenda , and german domestic policy will be centre stage again .
how are things at the moment with your coalition partners , the social democrats ?
what 's the mood like in the grand coalition ? well to be honest , i find this differentiation between foreign policy and domestic policy has become somewhat short-sighted these days .
there are very few things that can still be divided up so simply .
if i am dealing with patent laws in germany , if i am supporting initiatives of excellence , if i am trying to ensure that 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes to research - then i ca n't say that 's just domestic policy .
we also have to protect our intellectual property worldwide .
domestic and foreign policy are inextricably linked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard to look at germany without thinking of europe if you 're talking about the lifting of the monopoly on mail deliveries in germany - then there are immediate consequences in terms of the eu rules , and what other european countries are doing .
you ca n't just look at international politics and say : " that 's all red carpets , and the rest is n't . "
it 's not like that any more in the real world of politics . secondly , in terms of what is possible to legislate here in germany , we have a great deal planned in terms of fundamental policies .
we have now agreed on a reform of the system of nursing care for the elderly .
in the second half of the year , we are going to discuss ways of enabling workers to participate in corporate profits .
that 's a huge project . we need to clarify the situation with accident insurance .
we 'll be facing the challenge of combining energy policy with targets on climate protection .
there 'll be a summit on integration , with the first coherent proposals from both the federal states and the central government on how to improve integration in germany .
so the coalition has a lot left to do , and of course i am looking forward to making all of these things happen - just as we will continue to play an intensive role in europe . for my last question , i 'd like to just dig a little dee per .
your coalition partner is not doing well in opinion polls , and the new left party presents a mathematical challenge , at least , to the continued existence of your government , and is making advances to the spd .
is that not a bit of a political headache ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes the germans will have reason to applaude the grand coalition 's efforts my main concern is to ensure that our government , our grand coalition , with its solid majority in the german parliament , is able to fulfill all that is expected of it .
unemployment is falling .
it 's already down to 3.8 million , that 's a huge success .
joblessness among young people is down by 25 percent .
and the more such successes we can demonstrate , the more we can be seen acting together in the coaltion , the more that will send the signal that others are merely making promises that they can not keep . i think the people of this country will realize that .
so i recommend that we concentrate on the work we have to do - fulfilling the wishes and the expectations of the german citizens .
we need to direct our energies to the people of this country , and then we will be successful - and i do n't mean just one party in the government , but both parties . christian f. trippe interviewed angela merkel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .

" this bridge joining nations ought not just to significantly reduce driving time between hamburg and copenhagen , it 's also very important for transport routes in all of europe , " tiefensee said , adding the bridge should be completed by 2018 . both countries ' parliaments must still approve the plan , which requires a treaty , the german transport ministry said . 19 kilometers -lrb- 11.81 miles -rrb- long , the bridge will run from puttgarden on the baltic island of fehmarn and rødby on the danish island of lolland , sparing motorists traveling between the two countries a ferry journey across the fehmarn strait and easing the trip from hamburg to copenhagen .

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- left -rrb- und lech kaczynski have stirred things up in the eu the european commission said it opposed the polish plan .
its president jose manuel barroso urged all governments to respect the deal clinched in brussels last week . the new treaty will simplify the way the eu makes decisions as it expands and create the posts of foreign policy supremo and a longer-term president . under the terms of the compromise reached last week , the double majority voting system opposed by the poles will not be introduced until 2017 .
it would then include a provision for states to be able to delay eu decisions if they are just short of enough votes to block them . warsaw says it had agreed to a delay of two years in such cases , but eu officials say the deal was for decisions to be postponed only until the next eu summit . " we have to finally resolve this issue at the inter-governmental conference , " jaroslaw kaczynski said when asked if he planned to fight for poland 's interpretation of the deal .
he later said that it was a question of committing to paper what had already been agreed on voting rights . " a misunderstanding " jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister whose country takes over the eu presidency from germany on sunday , called kaczynski 's comments " a misunderstanding . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister jose socrates takes over the eu presidency next month " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's comments sparked outrage among politicians in brussels . " i just ca n't believe it , " martin schulz , head of the social democrat group in the eu parliament told spiegel online .
" you ca n't question what was agreed upon after such a dramatic summit , " he said . jaroslaw kaczynski 's latest comments are likely to further antagonize eu neighbors and reinforce warsaw 's image as an unpredictable partner . polish president lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin brother , horrified eu leaders recently when he spoke of the horrors of nazi germany 's occupation of poland during world war two to bolster poland 's demands at the brussels summit . poland 's relations with germany , in particular , have cooled considerably since its tough negotiating stance in brussels . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty is designed to reform the 27-member bloc 's institutions . " totally unacceptable " unsurprisingly , kaczynski 's latest comments have raised hackles among eu partners who have been celebrating the outcome of the tortuous treaty negotiations as a success . the german president of the european parliament , hans gert pottering , called the new polish demand " totally unacceptable .

it 's a small world since the world wide web was spun around it 15 years ago .
everyday life goes through a constant revolution .
one of the victims : tv .
but does the net make us different people ? these days , you can find just about anything on the internet : airplane tickets and christmas trees , george w. bush and osama bin laden , aerial and satellite images , dark corners , live news , second life – maybe even the love of your life .
not quite 15 years after the world got its web , everyday life is hardly recognizable .
" something mad like that " moore ’ s law that computing power will reduplicate every two years - an unbelievable feat of physics and industry - has been holding true for over 30 years .
“ no generation before , if i ’ m allowed to go back in time till homer , has seen something mad like that , ” said media theoretician friedrich a. kittler , born in 1943 - the year in which the future ibm boss appraised the worldwide need of computers at “ maybe five . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four percent of internet users are addicted similar to the industrial revolution 200 years before , the digital revolution has changed every area of life faster than anybody would have imagined .
in the beginning of the 1990s when people struggled with phone books , dictionaries and maps and wrote post cards from overseas , many things that are self-evident today sounded like science fiction .
according to christiane funken , a communication scientist from the technical university of berlin , the speed and force of the revolution was unforeseeable .
“ the development we have gone through is a continuous , radical one – and it ’ s still in progress , ” she said .
the future of man and machine so much of everyday life is changing that nobody seriously dares to forecast how the coexistence of man and machine is going to develop .
however , many it specialists consider it rather unlikely that - for the foreseeable future - humans and computers will be able to communicate via voice .
“ it ’ s hard to say what comes next , ” said communication scientist funken .
“ the only thing that ’ s for sure is that we ’ ll rather spend more time online than less . ”
the kind of people that are using the internet are changing as well .
“ a few years ago we could say the internet user was young and male - but this time is over , ” funken said .
today every social group has a home on the internet .
the difference concerning gender and generation is increasingly fading as many elderly people begin to go online .
the biggest difference remains between the sexes .
“ we know that the much discussed run and gun games are played almost exclusively by boys , girls on the other hand prefer chatting , ” funken said .
bye-bye tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pianist lang lang gives a concert in second life according to a survey by microsoft and mtv , e-mails are considered slow and old-fashioned and as a means of communication used by parents and teachers .
the digital youth definitely prefers instant massaging and live chatting .
ten years ago andy grove , boss of chip giant intel , declared the “ war of the eyeballs ” between computer and tv .
now the outcome seems to have been decided by the next generation : the computer has already overtaken the television in many kids ’ rooms .
“ the tv set will disappear , ” kiddler said .
some studies claim that americans already surf the web for an hour more than they spend in front of the television .
even with all the advances of internet radio and tv , communication is still by far the most important function of the internet .
users today interact via chat , instant messaging , e-mail and in forums .
according to other surveys done in highly-developed asian countries , 60 to 80 percent of real-life social contact is initiated online .
when second life becomes life so is the internet a backup world , a parallel universe with different rules or simply a digital reflection of the offline world ?
“ from a sociological point of view , i would agree to that , ” funken said .
but to some this mirror seems to be more pleasant than the original .
a 2006 survey by the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- found that four percent of all internet users are addicts .
that means that out of the 35 million germans online , 1.5 million are addicted - spending more than five hours a day on the internet in private live .
these addicts may have already said good-bye to their real life .
for them the internet is no more second life , but the first . oliver samson -lrb- ct -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

smoking in enclosed public spaces will now be stubbed out across the entire length and breadth of the uk , as england follows in the footsteps of scotland , northern ireland and wales on 1 july .
british smokers will no longer able to light up inside their favourite pub or bar , so you might expect that cigarette sales are set to fall significantly beyond the usual 2 % to 3 % drop each year .
however , the uk 's main tobacco firms claim that all previous smoking bans have only caused a temporary additional fall in sales , and they expect this to be repeated in england .
return to normal tobacco industry analyst andrew darke of evolution securities points to the republic of ireland , which in march 2004 became the world 's first country to ban smoking in all enclosed public places .
the cigarette firms are absolutely not worried by the english ban adam speilman of citigroup " the experience in places like ireland is that immediately after the ban you see a 5 to 6 % dip in sales , but then this soon wears off , and sales return to the normal 2 to 3 % annual fall , " says mr darke .
official figures from the republic of ireland 's office of tobacco control seem to bare this out .
its statistics show that the proportion of people in ireland who smoked before the irish ban started in march 2004 was about 26.5 % , falling to just above 24 % a year later , but then rising again to 25.5 % in december 2005 .
the irish experience suggests english smokers will just go outside the figures for the republic of ireland suggest that while many smokers initially quit , or at least cut down , to avoid having to go outside for a cigarette , some soon learn to put up with this inconvenience .
here the tobacco companies lend a tremendous helping hand that should not be forgotten - cigarettes are addictive .
after all , there are few things other than fags that make people choose to cower under an umbrella in the pouring rain .
alternatively , many smokers will instead decide to spend more of their cigarette-filled leisure time at home .
weather impact the timing of england 's smoking ban - in the middle of summer - should not be overlooked , observes tobacco sector analyst david ireland of abn amro .
while scotland , both parts of ireland , and wales all brought in their bans at the end of winter or the start of spring , england 's choice of 1 july means that more smoking pub-goers will already be sitting outside in beer gardens .
at least if the recent torrential rain goes away .
" smokers will continue to choose to smoke , " says simon evans , spokesman for imperial tobacco , the best-selling tobacco company within in the uk .
" the impact in the republic of ireland has also been born out in scotland -lsb- which introduced its ban in mach of last year -rsb- . "
perhaps unsurprisingly , anti-smoking group ash - or action on smoking and health - disagrees .
while it acknowledges that the republic of ireland has been a partial rebound in smoking numbers , it says that a ban combined with health campaigns and other measures can lead to a real and lasting decline in cigarette consumption .
ash spokesman martin dockrell says he expects forthcoming official scottish data to reflect this .

the audit office study criticised the length of time the evaluation had lasted and listed its failures .
it said the scheme resulted in higher pay for more people than anticipated and caused financial problems for the belfast and south eastern boards .
the total cost of the scheme has yet to be ascertained .
however , comptroller and auditor general john dowdall said he had identified £ 124m which had been handed over by the department of education and department of culture , arts and leisure .
running costs mr dowdall said he was not able to quantify how much more had been absorbed by the boards within their running costs .
the report said as of 31 july 2006 a total of 28,715 posts in the five boards had been evaluated , but a further 1,795 were outstanding , while some 6,800 classroom assistants whose posts were included in those evaluated had yet to agree their claim with management .
while there were a number of factors which impacted on the completion of the job evaluation exercise " the timescale has been far too long " , said the report .
it added : " northern ireland audit office considers that the exercise should have been managed from the outset within an agreed timeframe , with clear lines of responsibility established for completion within that time frame . "

the report said as of 31 july 2006 a total of 28,715 posts in the five boards had been evaluated , but a further 1,795 were outstanding , while some 6,800 classroom assistants whose posts were included in those evaluated had yet to agree their claim with management .
while there were a number of factors which impacted on the completion of the job evaluation exercise " the timescale has been far too long " , said the report .
it added : " northern ireland audit office considers that the exercise should have been managed from the outset within an agreed timeframe , with clear lines of responsibility established for completion within that time frame . "

the audit office study criticised the length of time the evaluation had lasted and listed its failures .
it said the scheme resulted in higher pay for more people than anticipated and caused financial problems for the belfast and south eastern boards .
the total cost of the scheme has yet to be ascertained .
however , comptroller and auditor general john dowdall said he had identified £ 124m which had been handed over by the department of education and department of culture , arts and leisure .
running costs mr dowdall said he was not able to quantify how much more had been absorbed by the boards within their running costs .
the report said as of 31 july 2006 a total of 28,715 posts in the five boards had been evaluated , but a further 1,795 were outstanding , while some 6,800 classroom assistants whose posts were included in those evaluated had yet to agree their claim with management .
while there were a number of factors which impacted on the completion of the job evaluation exercise " the timescale has been far too long " , said the report .
it added : " northern ireland audit office considers that the exercise should have been managed from the outset within an agreed timeframe , with clear lines of responsibility established for completion within that time frame . "
the failure to implement from the outset key recommendations of an agreed action plan - including the establishment of a centralised unit to oversee the scheme - was " a missed opportunity " .
that missed opportunity was recognised following an internal management review in 1997 , but the necessary steps to rectify matters were not taken for another two years , it added .

the core consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- for may was down 0.1 % from a year ago , government figures showed .
the data , however , is unlikely to deter the bank of japan from raising interest rates from their current level of 0.5 % by august , analysts say .
this view was backed by figures showing the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.8 % - the lowest level since 1998 .
yen weakens chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki played down the consumer price data , which is a key measure of whether the country has fully emerged from years of deflation and is used by the bank of japan to help it decide on future interest rate policy .
" looking at overall price movements , we maintain our view that the end of deflation is in sight , " he said .
bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui has said in the past that if the prospects for economic growth are convincing , then interest rates could rise even if consumer prices are slightly down .
the yen fell to trade at 123.41 against the dollar on doubts of the extent to which japanese policymakers can raise interest rates without choking off the country 's economic recovery .

" looking at overall price movements , we maintain our view that the end of deflation is in sight , " he said .

mr hain will succeed john hutton who has overseen a major shake-up of the state pension system .
key reforms included a gradual increase in the state pension age to 68 and a restoration of the link between earnings and the state pension level .
mr hain faces major challenges such as reform of the benefits system and whether to boost compensation to people who have lost their pensions .
since 1997 about 125,000 people are estimated to have lost all or part of their pension as a result of their employer going bust .
the financial assistance scheme -lrb- fas -rrb- has been set up by the government to compensate these people .
however , the fas has been criticised by pension campaigners for being too bureaucratic and not paying out enough .
campaigners and opposition parties have called for an urgent overhaul of the fas but the government has said this would be too expensive .
anti-apartheid campaigner mr hain was born in nairobi and brought up in south africa .
he was educated at pretoria boys high school , the university of london and sussex university .
he was a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner in the 1970s .
he entered the commons following a by-election in 1991 .
he has held several ministerial posts at the foreign office and the department of trade and industry .
most recently he has doubled-up as northern ireland and welsh secretary , and he was recently defeated in the labour party 's deputy leadership election .

the financial assistance scheme -lrb- fas -rrb- has been set up by the government to compensate these people .
however , the fas has been criticised by pension campaigners for being too bureaucratic and not paying out enough .
campaigners and opposition parties have called for an urgent overhaul of the fas but the government has said this would be too expensive .
anti-apartheid campaigner mr hain was born in nairobi and brought up in south africa .
he was educated at pretoria boys high school , the university of london and sussex university .
he was a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner in the 1970s .
he entered the commons following a by-election in 1991 .
he has held several ministerial posts at the foreign office and the department of trade and industry .
most recently he has doubled-up as northern ireland and welsh secretary , and he was recently defeated in the labour party 's deputy leadership election .

senators voted against keeping the bill alive , effectively delaying action on the emotive immigration issue until after the 2008 presidential election .
the proposed legislation set out ways for some of the around 12 million illegal immigrants to seek citizenship .
the bill 's opponents said this amounted to an amnesty for breaking the law .
hours before the vote , the capitol 's switchboard was jammed by thousands of calls from groups and individuals arguing both for and against the bill , signalling its deeply divisive impact .
" the american people won today .
they care enough for their country to get mad and to fight for it , " said republican senator jim demint .
backers of the bill expressed their deep disappointment .
democrat senator edward kennedy insisted the immigration reform was inevitable , although it might take years .
referring to the legislation 's opponents , he said : " what are they going to do with the 12 million who are undocumented here ?
send them back to countries around the world ?
develop a type of gestapo here to seek out these people that are in the shadows ?
what 's their alternative ? "
as well as allowing some illegal immigrants to eventually seek citizenship , the planned legislation would have also offered some would-be migrants the chance to apply for a guest-worker programme .
the bill also proposed tougher border controls to prevent more illegal immigrants from entering the country .
' stunning ' defeat president bush spent much of thursday morning on the phone , trying to persuade senators to back the bill . "
the american people understand the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to our immigration laws " president bush q & a : us immigration debate us illegal immigrants : facts as the vote neared , homeland security secretary michael chertoff and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez approached senators directly outside the chamber in an effort to win them over .
eventually , 53 members of the 100-seat senate voted against limiting debate on the immigration bill and taking it to a final vote .
in a brief statement after the vote , president bush said immigration was a burning issue for the american people and " congress ' failure to act on it is a disappointment " .
" the american people understand the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to our immigration laws , " he said .
" a lot of us worked hard to see if we could n't find common ground .
it did n't work . "
the senate now goes into summer recess .
security priority mexican president felipe calderon said the us senate had made a grave error . "
those from abroad may not be able to believe that anything recommended by bush is good , but , believe it or not , this is one policy of his that should have been enacted " ben casement , new york send us your views " the us economy can not keep going without migrant labour , " mr calderon said .
business leaders and lobbyists for immigration reform voiced upset at the result .
" we were looking to politicians for leadership on this issue , and there has been none and it 's deeply disappointing , " sheridan bailey , a co-founder of arizona employers for immigration reform , told reuters news agency .
" it 's like in vietnam when they said ' we had to destroy the village to save it , ' - well , here they are destroying the economy to save the us border . "
but opponents of the bill said the vote highlighted citizens ' concerns that boosting border security was the biggest priority .
americans want " action , they want results , they want proof , because they 've heard all the promises before , " republican senator david vitter told afp news agency .

senators voted against keeping the bill alive , effectively delaying action on the emotive immigration issue until after the 2008 presidential election .
the proposed legislation set out ways for some of the around 12 million illegal immigrants to seek citizenship .
the bill 's opponents said this amounted to an amnesty for breaking the law .
hours before the vote , the capitol 's switchboard was jammed by thousands of calls from groups and individuals arguing both for and against the bill , signalling its deeply divisive impact .
" the american people won today .
they care enough for their country to get mad and to fight for it , " said republican senator jim demint .
backers of the bill expressed their deep disappointment .
democrat senator edward kennedy insisted the immigration reform was inevitable , although it might take years .
referring to the legislation 's opponents , he said : " what are they going to do with the 12 million who are undocumented here ?
send them back to countries around the world ?
develop a type of gestapo here to seek out these people that are in the shadows ?
what 's their alternative ? "
as well as allowing some illegal immigrants to eventually seek citizenship , the planned legislation would have also offered some would-be migrants the chance to apply for a guest-worker programme .
the bill also proposed tougher border controls to prevent more illegal immigrants from entering the country .
' stunning ' defeat president bush spent much of thursday morning on the phone , trying to persuade senators to back the bill .

the offenders are being let out up to 18 days early .
more than 25,000 could benefit after inmate numbers in england and wales topped 81,000 .
but inmates convicted of serious sexual or violent offences are excluded .
newly-appointed justice secretary jack straw told the bbc the early release scheme would continue for " some time " .
" this will carry on until we do get stability in the prison population , " mr straw told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
the releases come as a report into portland young offenders institution in dorset suggested " damage " caused by prison overcrowding .
concern expressed the early-release scheme , the first of its kind for 20 years , was announced by former justice secretary lord falconer last week .
the aim is to free space in the prison system and end the costly practice of holding prisoners in police stations and court cells .
those serving less than 12 months will not be supervised but could be sent back to prison if they re-offend during the early-release period .
probation officials have expressed concern about whether the offenders will be properly risk-assessed .
mr straw asserted that prison doors were not " simply being opened " .
" what we are talking about here is people to be released 18 days before their normal release date , " he said .
' population pressure ' chief inspector of prisons anne owers said the portland report was a clear example of the damage caused by the prison population crisis .
an unannounced inspection found the institution continued to suffer from unfit buildings , insufficient activity , negative staff culture and inadequate arrangements for young people 's safety .
the young people , mainly from london , were also held too far away from their homes , it found .
chief inspector of prisons anne owers said : " in spite of its continuing difficulties , portland had improved and managers were well aware of the scale of the task ahead .
" but that task was greatly compromised by the effects of population pressure . "

james purnell was an adviser to tony blair before becoming an mp until may last year , he was minister for media and tourism in the department for culture , media and sport .
he introduced new tax breaks for the film industry and handled the tricky subject of licensing reform , steering legislation through the house of commons to permit round-the-clock drinking .
then he was switched to pensions reform , as a result of which he has just been named which ?
consumer champion of the year , further confirming his reputation as a rising star .
now he is back in the area he knows best .
before becoming an mp in 2001 , mr purnell worked as tony blair 's special adviser on culture , media , sport and the knowledge economy .
for two years before that , from 1995 to 1997 , he worked for john birt as the bbc 's head of corporate planning .
britain really has got talent - everyone should have the chance to develop their passions and hone their skill james purnell " i could n't be happier to be coming back to dcms " he said .
" it 's full of dedicated enthusiastic people doing some of the most noble work government can do .
" britain has always been characterised by its art and sport , its music and its literature .
we lead the world in the fullness of culture and the creativity of our people . "
having acknowledged the higher arts , he also gave a nod to popular culture with a reference to a recent hit itv show .
" britain really has got talent , " he said .
" everyone should have the chance to develop their passions and hone their skill .
fulfilling that right is my job , and i ca n't wait to get started . "
the digital tv switchover will begin in cumbria in october so what is top of his in tray ?
one issue - the one which arguably he knows best - has already been resolved .
the bbc 's charter and licence fee have been settled and its new chairman appointed .
it is now for the corporation , not the government , to decide how the money will be allocated .
but one major broadcasting issue still looms large .
digital switchover - strictly speaking , the analogue tv switch-off - starts this autumn in whitehaven in cumbria .
it is the biggest household conversion project since the switch to north sea gas and plenty of pitfalls await .
before then , mr purnell faces several other important issues .
the first is the government 's casino plans , which lie in tatters after the house of lords voted to reject manchester as the location of britain 's first " super-casino " .
manchester 's planned super-casino , as seen in an artist 's impression the new culture secretary may have to go back to the drawing board , and the two original front-runners - blackpool and the o2 , on the former site of the millennium dome in greenwich - are waiting eagerly to see what the government decides .
a linked issue is gambling .
the new gambling act , imposing a mixture of relaxations and restrictions , must be implemented in september , and that could reignite lots of controversy .
then there 's the next national lottery licence , which is due to be awarded in august .
camelot remains the hot favourite , with just one challenger - the indian lottery operator sugal and damani .
but remember the chaos last time , when the national lottery commission decided neither bid was fit to win ?
and remember just how much money the lottery has got to raise to pay for the 2012 olympics ?
plenty of potential pitfalls there .
ah yes , the olympics .
purnell 's predecessor and former boss tessa jowell has been made the minister for the olympics , taking charge of the organisation for 2012 .
cultural olympiad she will chair the olympic delivery authority and be based in the cabinet office , reporting directly to prime minister gordon brown .
but mr purnell will be responsible for the cultural olympiad - which runs alongside the main event .
he also has to ensure that uk sportsmen and women perform to their utmost in 2012 , and that there is an olympic sporting legacy .
plenty of room for confusion there .
as the minister in charge of the lottery , he must also face the rows over whether or not the arts , heritage and other existing beneficiaries are going to suffer because of the diversion of funds to the olympics .
mr purnell may have to find funds for buckingham palace repairs but the big arts row is likely to be over the government 's spending review this autumn .
the major arts organisations , museums and galleries have already been warned to expect a tightening of belts .
the perennial squeals have begun .
they are likely to argue that it is very well for mr purnell to say the uk " leads the world in the fullness of culture and the creativity of our people " provided he puts his money where his mouth is .
and the new culture secretary now finds buckingham palace joining the battle for funds .
it turns out that bits of the palace walls are falling off , narrowly missing the royal cars and causing major health and safety issues .
a senior royal aide said he understood the government 's difficulties in providing funds for repairs , as money was tight and the department for culture , media and sports also had the 2012 olympics to contend with .
but it is another rather worrying issue in the purnell in tray .

james purnell was an adviser to tony blair before becoming an mp until may last year , he was minister for media and tourism in the department for culture , media and sport .
he introduced new tax breaks for the film industry and handled the tricky subject of licensing reform , steering legislation through the house of commons to permit round-the-clock drinking .
then he was switched to pensions reform , as a result of which he has just been named which ?
consumer champion of the year , further confirming his reputation as a rising star .
now he is back in the area he knows best .
before becoming an mp in 2001 , mr purnell worked as tony blair 's special adviser on culture , media , sport and the knowledge economy .
for two years before that , from 1995 to 1997 , he worked for john birt as the bbc 's head of corporate planning .
britain really has got talent - everyone should have the chance to develop their passions and hone their skill james purnell " i could n't be happier to be coming back to dcms " he said .
" it 's full of dedicated enthusiastic people doing some of the most noble work government can do .
" britain has always been characterised by its art and sport , its music and its literature .

fulfilling that right is my job , and i ca n't wait to get started . "
the digital tv switchover will begin in cumbria in october so what is top of his in tray ?
one issue - the one which arguably he knows best - has already been resolved .
the bbc 's charter and licence fee have been settled and its new chairman appointed .
it is now for the corporation , not the government , to decide how the money will be allocated .
but one major broadcasting issue still looms large .
digital switchover - strictly speaking , the analogue tv switch-off - starts this autumn in whitehaven in cumbria .
it is the biggest household conversion project since the switch to north sea gas and plenty of pitfalls await .
before then , mr purnell faces several other important issues .
the first is the government 's casino plans , which lie in tatters after the house of lords voted to reject manchester as the location of britain 's first " super-casino " .
manchester 's planned super-casino , as seen in an artist 's impression the new culture secretary may have to go back to the drawing board , and the two original front-runners - blackpool and the o2 , on the former site of the millennium dome in greenwich - are waiting eagerly to see what the government decides .
a linked issue is gambling .
the new gambling act , imposing a mixture of relaxations and restrictions , must be implemented in september , and that could reignite lots of controversy .
then there 's the next national lottery licence , which is due to be awarded in august .
camelot remains the hot favourite , with just one challenger - the indian lottery operator sugal and damani .
but remember the chaos last time , when the national lottery commission decided neither bid was fit to win ?
and remember just how much money the lottery has got to raise to pay for the 2012 olympics ?
plenty of potential pitfalls there .
ah yes , the olympics .

until may last year , he was minister for media and tourism in the department for culture , media and sport .
he introduced new tax breaks for the film industry and handled the tricky subject of licensing reform , steering legislation through the house of commons to permit round-the-clock drinking .
then he was switched to pensions reform , as a result of which he has just been named which ?
consumer champion of the year , further confirming his reputation as a rising star .
now he is back in the area he knows best .
before becoming an mp in 2001 , mr purnell worked as tony blair 's special adviser on culture , media , sport and the knowledge economy .
for two years before that , from 1995 to 1997 , he worked for john birt as the bbc 's head of corporate planning . "
britain really has got talent - everyone should have the chance to develop their passions and hone their skill " james purnell " i could n't be happier to be coming back to dcms " he said .
" it 's full of dedicated enthusiastic people doing some of the most noble work government can do .
" britain has always been characterised by its art and sport , its music and its literature .
we lead the world in the fullness of culture and the creativity of our people . "
having acknowledged the higher arts , he also gave a nod to popular culture with a reference to a recent hit itv show .
" britain really has got talent , " he said .
" everyone should have the chance to develop their passions and hone their skill .
fulfilling that right is my job , and i ca n't wait to get started . "
so what is top of his in tray ?
one issue - the one which arguably he knows best - has already been resolved .
the bbc 's charter and licence fee have been settled and its new chairman appointed .
it is now for the corporation , not the government , to decide how the money will be allocated .
but one major broadcasting issue still looms large .
digital switchover - strictly speaking , the analogue tv switch-off - starts this autumn in whitehaven in cumbria .
it is the biggest household conversion project since the switch to north sea gas and plenty of pitfalls await .
before then , mr purnell faces several other important issues .
the first is the government 's casino plans , which lie in tatters after the house of lords voted to reject manchester as the location of britain 's first " super-casino " .
the new culture secretary may have to go back to the drawing board , and the two original front-runners - blackpool and the o2 , on the former site of the millennium dome in greenwich - are waiting eagerly to see what the government decides .
a linked issue is gambling .
the new gambling act , imposing a mixture of relaxations and restrictions , must be implemented in september , and that could reignite lots of controversy .
then there 's the next national lottery licence , which is due to be awarded in august .
camelot remains the hot favourite , with just one challenger - the indian lottery operator sugal and damani .
but remember the chaos last time , when the national lottery commission decided neither bid was fit to win ?
and remember just how much money the lottery has got to raise to pay for the 2012 olympics ?
plenty of potential pitfalls there .
ah yes , the olympics .
purnell 's predecessor and former boss tessa jowell has been made the minister for the olympics , taking charge of the organisation for 2012 .
cultural olympiad she will chair the olympic delivery authority and be based in the cabinet office , reporting directly to prime minister gordon brown .
but mr purnell will be responsible for the cultural olympiad - which runs alongside the main event .
he also has to ensure that uk sportsmen and women perform to their utmost in 2012 , and that there is an olympic sporting legacy .
plenty of room for confusion there .
as the minister in charge of the lottery , he must also face the rows over whether or not the arts , heritage and other existing beneficiaries are going to suffer because of the diversion of funds to the olympics .
but the big arts row is likely to be over the government 's spending review this autumn .
the major arts organisations , museums and galleries have already been warned to expect a tightening of belts .
the perennial squeals have begun .
they are likely to argue that it is very well for mr purnell to say the uk " leads the world in the fullness of culture and the creativity of our people " provided he puts his money where his mouth is .
and the new culture secretary now finds buckingham palace joining the battle for funds .
it turns out that bits of the palace walls are falling off , narrowly missing the royal cars and causing major health and safety issues .
a senior royal aide said he understood the government 's difficulties in providing funds for repairs , as money was tight and the department for culture , media and sports also had the 2012 olympics to contend with .
but it is another rather worrying issue in the purnell in tray .
did someone call it the ministry of fun ?
