only five points from the drop zone , the club has axed coach falko götz in favor of karsten heine . commercial manager dieter hoeness announced the decision at a press conference on tuesday morning in berlin . " we came to the conclusion that falko götz was n't able to reach the team anymore , " hoeness said .
" there are no excuses anymore .
we know what the players are capable of and they need to perform . " hoeness said that heine , previously the coach of hertha 's third-division developmental team , would take over on the bench until at least the end of the season . götz 's firing followed an eight-game winless streak that saw hertha go from champions league aspirants to one of the bundesliga 's many candidates for the second division . götz had come under fire in recent weeks from critics who said the former hoeness protégé no longer commanded the respect of his players . fatal blow against bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker pantelic , left , has gone stone cold in 2007 hertha 's desultory draw against lowly bielefeld last weekend was typical of their play in 2007 . a listless hertha squad went behind in front of an enraged home crowd , and when götz substituted stars marko pantelic and kevin prince boateng out late in the match , neither seemed to acknowledge his presence . hertha then equalized and might have saved götz 's job if they 'd built on that momentum , but a scant one minute later , defender joe simunic - reportedly no great fan of the former skipper - got himself sent off , killing any chance of a come-from-behind victory . will hoeness be next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of hertha 's winless streak was a humiliating home loss to tiny cottbus new coach karsten heine , who has twice previously held the job with hertha , now has six games to steer berlin clear of the drop zone .
should he fail , hoeness himself would be in great danger of dismissal . once revered in berlin for leading hertha from the lower ranks of the second division to the champions league , hoeness has squandered the fans ' favor after investing millions in supposed stars who turned out to be flops . he has also repeatedly clashed with top players such as former playmaker marcelinho -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- and , this year , pantelic . heine 's attempts to steady hertha 's listing ship begin this weekend with a tough away match against improving bochum . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen closes the gap on league leader 's schalke werder bremen 's markus rosenberg secured a 1-0 win against nuremberg at home on sunday to bring the northern team to just two points behind bundesliga leaders schalke 04 .

in bilateral talks , germany has renewed its commitment to syrian development . negotiations between german and syrian officials ended in germany with a german pledge for 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- in development aid to syria for the next two years , the german ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- announced on tuesday . for years , german officials have been working with the syrian government and various economic institutions to ease syria 's transition to a social market economy .

only five points from the drop zone , the club has axed coach falko götz in favor of karsten heine . commercial manager dieter hoeness announced the decision at a press conference on tuesday morning in berlin . " we came to the conclusion that falko götz was n't able to reach the team anymore , " hoeness said .
" there are no excuses anymore .
we know what the players are capable of and they need to perform . " hoeness said that heine , previously the coach of hertha 's third-division developmental team , would take over on the bench until at least the end of the season . götz 's firing followed an eight-game winless streak that saw hertha go from champions league aspirants to one of the bundesliga 's many candidates for the second division . götz had come under fire in recent weeks from critics who said the former hoeness protégé no longer commanded the respect of his players . fatal blow against bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker pantelic , left , has gone stone cold in 2007 hertha 's desultory draw against lowly bielefeld last weekend was typical of their play in 2007 . a listless hertha squad went behind in front of an enraged home crowd , and when götz substituted stars marko pantelic and kevin prince boateng out late in the match , neither seemed to acknowledge his presence . hertha then equalized and might have saved götz 's job if they 'd built on that momentum , but a scant one minute later , defender joe simunic - reportedly no great fan of the former skipper - got himself sent off , killing any chance of a come-from-behind victory . will hoeness be next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of hertha 's winless streak was a humiliating home loss to tiny cottbus new coach karsten heine , who has twice previously held the job with hertha , now has six games to steer berlin clear of the drop zone .
should he fail , hoeness himself would be in great danger of dismissal . once revered in berlin for leading hertha from the lower ranks of the second division to the champions league , hoeness has squandered the fans ' favor after investing millions in supposed stars who turned out to be flops . he has also repeatedly clashed with top players such as former playmaker marcelinho -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- and , this year , pantelic . heine 's attempts to steady hertha 's listing ship begin this weekend with a tough away match against improving bochum . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen closes the gap on league leader 's schalke werder bremen 's markus rosenberg secured a 1-0 win against nuremberg at home on sunday to bring the northern team to just two points behind bundesliga leaders schalke 04 .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.04.2007 german companies could harvest profits from climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way forward for german business : environmentally-friendly technologies the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change . german federal environment agency head andreas troge said over the weekend that germany should start spending 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- a year in the fight against global warming in order to avoid costs 20 times that amount within a generation . " if we are to halt global warning , we have to cut the emission of greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050 , " troge told the mass circulation bild newspaper . germany 's vibrant eco-industrial sector could potentially benefit from these measures .
according to munich-based business consultancy roland berger , germany - already the world 's top exporter - could experience an export-led boom in providing environmentally-friendly technology to the rest of the world . speaking to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , company head burkhard schwenker predicted turnover of a trillion euros for the green sector by 2030 , much of it in exports . germany is a world leader in green technologies that range from hi-tech refuse sorting to solar power cells .
almost half the world 's wind turbines contain german technology and every third solar cell carries the " made in germany " stamp .
a new industrial revolution ?
environment minister sigmar gabriel , who has commissioned an eco-atlas from roland berger , believes a " third industrial revolution " is under way , with germany in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative energy sources , such as wood pellets , are gaining currency his comments appeared to be supported by data from the association of renewable energy , which estimated that its members exported to the tune of 6 billion euros last year , 30 percent more than in the previous year . roland berger consultants expect greater changes , forecasting that by 2020 , more families would be living off the income provided by green-tech than from machine tools or vehicle production - long the mainstays of the german economy . environmental technology already employs a million people , according to a survey by the company , and competition for skilled personnel is stiff .
china needs clean power german companies have been eyeing china with special interest .
china 's energy needs are estimated to be rising by 20 percent a year , and the population is suffering from the polluting effects of inefficient coal-fired electricity generation .
huge opportunity beckons for providers of coal-based clean power . germany is the world leader in generating electricity from low-quality lignite -lrb- brown coal -rrb- and in cutting the harmful emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in cutting the harmful emissions of coal china also faces problems with water purification and refuse disposal .
here , too , german companies believe they have solutions . gabriel is to present his eco-atlas at the g8 summit to be hosted by germany in the northern resort of heiligendamm in june . meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel has pledged to push for drastic action to counter climate change . as the german chancellor takes the moral high ground , executives of german green-tech firms will have their eyes firmly on the turnover figures . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 10.04.2007 german companies could harvest profits from climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way forward for german business : environmentally-friendly technologies the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change . german federal environment agency head andreas troge said over the weekend that germany should start spending 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- a year in the fight against global warming in order to avoid costs 20 times that amount within a generation . " if we are to halt global warning , we have to cut the emission of greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050 , " troge told the mass circulation bild newspaper . germany 's vibrant eco-industrial sector could potentially benefit from these measures .
according to munich-based business consultancy roland berger , germany - already the world 's top exporter - could experience an export-led boom in providing environmentally-friendly technology to the rest of the world . speaking to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , company head burkhard schwenker predicted turnover of a trillion euros for the green sector by 2030 , much of it in exports . germany is a world leader in green technologies that range from hi-tech refuse sorting to solar power cells .
almost half the world 's wind turbines contain german technology and every third solar cell carries the " made in germany " stamp .
a new industrial revolution ?
environment minister sigmar gabriel , who has commissioned an eco-atlas from roland berger , believes a " third industrial revolution " is under way , with germany in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative energy sources , such as wood pellets , are gaining currency his comments appeared to be supported by data from the association of renewable energy , which estimated that its members exported to the tune of 6 billion euros last year , 30 percent more than in the previous year . roland berger consultants expect greater changes , forecasting that by 2020 , more families would be living off the income provided by green-tech than from machine tools or vehicle production - long the mainstays of the german economy . environmental technology already employs a million people , according to a survey by the company , and competition for skilled personnel is stiff .
china needs clean power german companies have been eyeing china with special interest .
china 's energy needs are estimated to be rising by 20 percent a year , and the population is suffering from the polluting effects of inefficient coal-fired electricity generation .
huge opportunity beckons for providers of coal-based clean power . germany is the world leader in generating electricity from low-quality lignite -lrb- brown coal -rrb- and in cutting the harmful emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in cutting the harmful emissions of coal china also faces problems with water purification and refuse disposal .
here , too , german companies believe they have solutions . gabriel is to present his eco-atlas at the g8 summit to be hosted by germany in the northern resort of heiligendamm in june . meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel has pledged to push for drastic action to counter climate change . as the german chancellor takes the moral high ground , executives of german green-tech firms will have their eyes firmly on the turnover figures . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- carbon-capture test begins at german pilot plant europe ’ s leading energy utility , vattenfall , has begun test runs of a new technology aimed at capturing carbon dioxide at power plants .
a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .

" the presidency of the eu once again urges iran to comply with the demands of the international community and to create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table and for a solution to the conflict surrounding the iranian nuclear program .

only five points from the drop zone , the club has axed coach falko götz in favor of karsten heine . commercial manager dieter hoeness announced the decision at a press conference on tuesday morning in berlin . " we came to the conclusion that falko götz was n't able to reach the team anymore , " hoeness said .
" there are no excuses anymore .
we know what the players are capable of and they need to perform . " hoeness said that heine , previously the coach of hertha 's third-division developmental team , would take over on the bench until at least the end of the season . götz 's firing followed an eight-game winless streak that saw hertha go from champions league aspirants to one of the bundesliga 's many candidates for the second division . götz had come under fire in recent weeks from critics who said the former hoeness protégé no longer commanded the respect of his players . fatal blow against bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker pantelic , left , has gone stone cold in 2007 hertha 's desultory draw against lowly bielefeld last weekend was typical of their play in 2007 . a listless hertha squad went behind in front of an enraged home crowd , and when götz substituted stars marko pantelic and kevin prince boateng out late in the match , neither seemed to acknowledge his presence . hertha then equalized and might have saved götz 's job if they 'd built on that momentum , but a scant one minute later , defender joe simunic - reportedly no great fan of the former skipper - got himself sent off , killing any chance of a come-from-behind victory . will hoeness be next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of hertha 's winless streak was a humiliating home loss to tiny cottbus new coach karsten heine , who has twice previously held the job with hertha , now has six games to steer berlin clear of the drop zone .
should he fail , hoeness himself would be in great danger of dismissal . once revered in berlin for leading hertha from the lower ranks of the second division to the champions league , hoeness has squandered the fans ' favor after investing millions in supposed stars who turned out to be flops . he has also repeatedly clashed with top players such as former playmaker marcelinho -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- and , this year , pantelic . heine 's attempts to steady hertha 's listing ship begin this weekend with a tough away match against improving bochum . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen closes the gap on league leader 's schalke werder bremen 's markus rosenberg secured a 1-0 win against nuremberg at home on sunday to bring the northern team to just two points behind bundesliga leaders schalke 04 .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.04.2007 german companies could harvest profits from climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way forward for german business : environmentally-friendly technologies the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change . german federal environment agency head andreas troge said over the weekend that germany should start spending 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- a year in the fight against global warming in order to avoid costs 20 times that amount within a generation . " if we are to halt global warning , we have to cut the emission of greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050 , " troge told the mass circulation bild newspaper . germany 's vibrant eco-industrial sector could potentially benefit from these measures .
according to munich-based business consultancy roland berger , germany - already the world 's top exporter - could experience an export-led boom in providing environmentally-friendly technology to the rest of the world . speaking to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , company head burkhard schwenker predicted turnover of a trillion euros for the green sector by 2030 , much of it in exports . germany is a world leader in green technologies that range from hi-tech refuse sorting to solar power cells .
almost half the world 's wind turbines contain german technology and every third solar cell carries the " made in germany " stamp .
a new industrial revolution ?
environment minister sigmar gabriel , who has commissioned an eco-atlas from roland berger , believes a " third industrial revolution " is under way , with germany in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative energy sources , such as wood pellets , are gaining currency his comments appeared to be supported by data from the association of renewable energy , which estimated that its members exported to the tune of 6 billion euros last year , 30 percent more than in the previous year . roland berger consultants expect greater changes , forecasting that by 2020 , more families would be living off the income provided by green-tech than from machine tools or vehicle production - long the mainstays of the german economy . environmental technology already employs a million people , according to a survey by the company , and competition for skilled personnel is stiff .
china needs clean power german companies have been eyeing china with special interest .
china 's energy needs are estimated to be rising by 20 percent a year , and the population is suffering from the polluting effects of inefficient coal-fired electricity generation .
huge opportunity beckons for providers of coal-based clean power . germany is the world leader in generating electricity from low-quality lignite -lrb- brown coal -rrb- and in cutting the harmful emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in cutting the harmful emissions of coal china also faces problems with water purification and refuse disposal .
here , too , german companies believe they have solutions . gabriel is to present his eco-atlas at the g8 summit to be hosted by germany in the northern resort of heiligendamm in june . meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel has pledged to push for drastic action to counter climate change . as the german chancellor takes the moral high ground , executives of german green-tech firms will have their eyes firmly on the turnover figures . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- carbon-capture test begins at german pilot plant europe ’ s leading energy utility , vattenfall , has begun test runs of a new technology aimed at capturing carbon dioxide at power plants .
a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

only five points from the drop zone , the club has axed coach falko götz in favor of karsten heine . commercial manager dieter hoeness announced the decision at a press conference on tuesday morning in berlin . " we came to the conclusion that falko götz was n't able to reach the team anymore , " hoeness said .
" there are no excuses anymore .
we know what the players are capable of and they need to perform . " hoeness said that heine , previously the coach of hertha 's third-division developmental team , would take over on the bench until at least the end of the season . götz 's firing followed an eight-game winless streak that saw hertha go from champions league aspirants to one of the bundesliga 's many candidates for the second division . götz had come under fire in recent weeks from critics who said the former hoeness protégé no longer commanded the respect of his players . fatal blow against bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker pantelic , left , has gone stone cold in 2007 hertha 's desultory draw against lowly bielefeld last weekend was typical of their play in 2007 . a listless hertha squad went behind in front of an enraged home crowd , and when götz substituted stars marko pantelic and kevin prince boateng out late in the match , neither seemed to acknowledge his presence . hertha then equalized and might have saved götz 's job if they 'd built on that momentum , but a scant one minute later , defender joe simunic - reportedly no great fan of the former skipper - got himself sent off , killing any chance of a come-from-behind victory . will hoeness be next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of hertha 's winless streak was a humiliating home loss to tiny cottbus new coach karsten heine , who has twice previously held the job with hertha , now has six games to steer berlin clear of the drop zone .
should he fail , hoeness himself would be in great danger of dismissal . once revered in berlin for leading hertha from the lower ranks of the second division to the champions league , hoeness has squandered the fans ' favor after investing millions in supposed stars who turned out to be flops . he has also repeatedly clashed with top players such as former playmaker marcelinho -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- and , this year , pantelic . heine 's attempts to steady hertha 's listing ship begin this weekend with a tough away match against improving bochum . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen closes the gap on league leader 's schalke werder bremen 's markus rosenberg secured a 1-0 win against nuremberg at home on sunday to bring the northern team to just two points behind bundesliga leaders schalke 04 .

" the presidency of the european union has noted with great concern the announcement by iran that it intends to begin uranium enrichment on an industrial scale , " germany , the current eu president , said a statement on tuesday . " the presidency of the eu once again urges iran to comply with the demands of the international community and to create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table and for a solution to the conflict surrounding the iranian nuclear program . " iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that the country had set up an " industrial scale " operation to enrich uranium . enrichment remains sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could be on the way to enriching more uranium than the west thought possible experts said this would mean operating around 3,000 centrifuges to produce enriched uranium - nearly 10 times the number iran had previously declared . uranium enrichment is the key sticking point in the row between iran and the west because the process can also make the fissile core for an atomic bomb .
the western powers accuse tehran of seeking to make nuclear arms while tehran insists it is for power generation only . russia 's took a more restrained line .
a foreign ministry said tuesday that for the moment it saw no evidence that iran had made the breakthrough it claims in its nuclear fuel enrichment program . " we do not know of any recent technological breakthroughs in the iranian nuclear program that would change the character of the work in the field of enrichment , " ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . stiff response from west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its nuclear program is designed only to produce electricity but french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called iran 's announcement " a bad sign . " " i once again urge iran to respect security council resolutions , which demand the suspension of all sensitive nuclear activities , " he added . britain and the united states also issued robust responses . the united states on monday said making good on ahmadinejad 's claim would expose iran to tougher international pressure . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran was " almost completely encircled by the international community because of their actions , and that pressure is only going to increase if they persist . " a british foreign office spokesman said monday that iran 's latest declaration was a further breach of iaea and un resolutions . doubts over iran 's abilities remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced iran 's most recent claims are true iran defiance of western calls to suspend enrichment have earned it two sets of un sanctions since december . one us-based analyst also expressed doubt as to whether iran has begun to enrich uranium with their larger array of centrifuges . " the purpose today was to publicly state that they had the centrifuges , " said david albright , a former un nuclear inspector and now president of the washington-based institute for science and international security . " it would be a big surprise though if they did start to enrich , " he said , adding that putting the centrifuges into action would " seriously reduce their chances of having any meaningful negotiations with the europeans .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.04.2007 germany expands economic assistance to syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has offered 70 million euros in aid to syria over the next two years syria has enlisted the help of germany to push forward economic reforms and attract foreign investors .
in bilateral talks , germany has renewed its commitment to syrian development . negotiations between german and syrian officials ended in germany with a german pledge for 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- in development aid to syria for the next two years , the german ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- announced on tuesday . for years , german officials have been working with the syrian government and various economic institutions to ease syria 's transition to a social market economy .
the syrian economy has been managed centrally by the state since the 1960s , when the country nationalized most of its major enterprises .
designed to address regional and class disparities , this legacy of state intervention and price controls is now seen as hindering economic growth . the german strategy emphasizes the promotion of micro-credits to entrepreneurs unable to secure loans from commercial banks , according to the german development ministry .
germany co-founded syria 's first " micro-finance bank " and has supported various other initiatives , the ministry said . the ministry added that it has been asked to consult on the privatization of the syrian national bank , a step that , in addition to other market reforms , could pave the way for international investors to do more business with syrian firms . renewable energy helps syria , and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leading producer of solar cells , and might be shipping them to syria soon germany and syria also agreed to cooperate in the area of renewable energies and energy efficiency , two industrial branches where germany has been traditionally strong . although syria is a major exporter of crude oil and natural gas , its reserves are dwindling , so that " the use of wind energy and provisions in the area of building insulation are becoming increasingly important , " the german development ministry said . germany boasts one of the world 's leading renewable energy industries , but because german energy markets are mostly saturated , producers and distributors of renewable power are on the lookout for new openings in the developing world . germans will also be sharing their knowledge in the area of water management and sewage systems . syria faces challenges and more reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin also promised to aid syria in water and waste management projects syrian deputy prime minister abdallah al-dardari , who is largely considered responsible for syria 's economic reforms , took part in the talks that ended last week , the german development ministry said . but despite the continued efforts of syrian and german policymakers , syria still faces a number of challenges , including low investment levels , numerous poorly performing public sector firms , a low rate of industrial productivity and high unemployment . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reaffirmed her intention to visit syria in the first half of the year . debate has begun in several western capitals on how far relations with damascus should reach , as some , including the us administration , have accused syria of supporting terrorism . last week leading us democratic legislator nancy pelosi defended a controversial meeting with syria 's president bashar al-assad .
pelosi said she told assad he could achieve peace in the region if he stops supporting terrorism . " we have no illusions about the complexity of the challenges facing this region , but hope that recent diplomatic activity will generate some momentum for progress , " pelosi said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies could harvest profits from climate change the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change .

" the purpose today was to publicly state that they had the centrifuges , " said david albright , a former un nuclear inspector and now president of the washington-based institute for science and international security . " it would be a big surprise though if they did start to enrich , " he said , adding that putting the centrifuges into action would " seriously reduce their chances of having any meaningful negotiations with the europeans .

in bilateral talks , germany has renewed its commitment to syrian development . negotiations between german and syrian officials ended in germany with a german pledge for 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- in development aid to syria for the next two years , the german ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- announced on tuesday . for years , german officials have been working with the syrian government and various economic institutions to ease syria 's transition to a social market economy .
the syrian economy has been managed centrally by the state since the 1960s , when the country nationalized most of its major enterprises .
designed to address regional and class disparities , this legacy of state intervention and price controls is now seen as hindering economic growth . the german strategy emphasizes the promotion of micro-credits to entrepreneurs unable to secure loans from commercial banks , according to the german development ministry .
germany co-founded syria 's first " micro-finance bank " and has supported various other initiatives , the ministry said . the ministry added that it has been asked to consult on the privatization of the syrian national bank , a step that , in addition to other market reforms , could pave the way for international investors to do more business with syrian firms . renewable energy helps syria , and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leading producer of solar cells , and might be shipping them to syria soon germany and syria also agreed to cooperate in the area of renewable energies and energy efficiency , two industrial branches where germany has been traditionally strong . although syria is a major exporter of crude oil and natural gas , its reserves are dwindling , so that " the use of wind energy and provisions in the area of building insulation are becoming increasingly important , " the german development ministry said . germany boasts one of the world 's leading renewable energy industries , but because german energy markets are mostly saturated , producers and distributors of renewable power are on the lookout for new openings in the developing world . germans will also be sharing their knowledge in the area of water management and sewage systems . syria faces challenges and more reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin also promised to aid syria in water and waste management projects syrian deputy prime minister abdallah al-dardari , who is largely considered responsible for syria 's economic reforms , took part in the talks that ended last week , the german development ministry said . but despite the continued efforts of syrian and german policymakers , syria still faces a number of challenges , including low investment levels , numerous poorly performing public sector firms , a low rate of industrial productivity and high unemployment . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reaffirmed her intention to visit syria in the first half of the year . debate has begun in several western capitals on how far relations with damascus should reach , as some , including the us administration , have accused syria of supporting terrorism . last week leading us democratic legislator nancy pelosi defended a controversial meeting with syria 's president bashar al-assad .
pelosi said she told assad he could achieve peace in the region if he stops supporting terrorism . " we have no illusions about the complexity of the challenges facing this region , but hope that recent diplomatic activity will generate some momentum for progress , " pelosi said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies could harvest profits from climate change the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.04.2007 germany expands economic assistance to syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has offered 70 million euros in aid to syria over the next two years syria has enlisted the help of germany to push forward economic reforms and attract foreign investors .
in bilateral talks , germany has renewed its commitment to syrian development . negotiations between german and syrian officials ended in germany with a german pledge for 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- in development aid to syria for the next two years , the german ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- announced on tuesday . for years , german officials have been working with the syrian government and various economic institutions to ease syria 's transition to a social market economy .
the syrian economy has been managed centrally by the state since the 1960s , when the country nationalized most of its major enterprises .
designed to address regional and class disparities , this legacy of state intervention and price controls is now seen as hindering economic growth . the german strategy emphasizes the promotion of micro-credits to entrepreneurs unable to secure loans from commercial banks , according to the german development ministry .
germany co-founded syria 's first " micro-finance bank " and has supported various other initiatives , the ministry said . the ministry added that it has been asked to consult on the privatization of the syrian national bank , a step that , in addition to other market reforms , could pave the way for international investors to do more business with syrian firms . renewable energy helps syria , and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leading producer of solar cells , and might be shipping them to syria soon germany and syria also agreed to cooperate in the area of renewable energies and energy efficiency , two industrial branches where germany has been traditionally strong . although syria is a major exporter of crude oil and natural gas , its reserves are dwindling , so that " the use of wind energy and provisions in the area of building insulation are becoming increasingly important , " the german development ministry said . germany boasts one of the world 's leading renewable energy industries , but because german energy markets are mostly saturated , producers and distributors of renewable power are on the lookout for new openings in the developing world . germans will also be sharing their knowledge in the area of water management and sewage systems . syria faces challenges and more reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin also promised to aid syria in water and waste management projects syrian deputy prime minister abdallah al-dardari , who is largely considered responsible for syria 's economic reforms , took part in the talks that ended last week , the german development ministry said . but despite the continued efforts of syrian and german policymakers , syria still faces a number of challenges , including low investment levels , numerous poorly performing public sector firms , a low rate of industrial productivity and high unemployment . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reaffirmed her intention to visit syria in the first half of the year . debate has begun in several western capitals on how far relations with damascus should reach , as some , including the us administration , have accused syria of supporting terrorism . last week leading us democratic legislator nancy pelosi defended a controversial meeting with syria 's president bashar al-assad .
pelosi said she told assad he could achieve peace in the region if he stops supporting terrorism . " we have no illusions about the complexity of the challenges facing this region , but hope that recent diplomatic activity will generate some momentum for progress , " pelosi said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies could harvest profits from climate change the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change .

the syrian economy has been managed centrally by the state since the 1960s , when the country nationalized most of its major enterprises .
designed to address regional and class disparities , this legacy of state intervention and price controls is now seen as hindering economic growth . the german strategy emphasizes the promotion of micro-credits to entrepreneurs unable to secure loans from commercial banks , according to the german development ministry .
germany co-founded syria 's first " micro-finance bank " and has supported various other initiatives , the ministry said . the ministry added that it has been asked to consult on the privatization of the syrian national bank , a step that , in addition to other market reforms , could pave the way for international investors to do more business with syrian firms . renewable energy helps syria , and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leading producer of solar cells , and might be shipping them to syria soon germany and syria also agreed to cooperate in the area of renewable energies and energy efficiency , two industrial branches where germany has been traditionally strong . although syria is a major exporter of crude oil and natural gas , its reserves are dwindling , so that " the use of wind energy and provisions in the area of building insulation are becoming increasingly important , " the german development ministry said . germany boasts one of the world 's leading renewable energy industries , but because german energy markets are mostly saturated , producers and distributors of renewable power are on the lookout for new openings in the developing world . germans will also be sharing their knowledge in the area of water management and sewage systems . syria faces challenges and more reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin also promised to aid syria in water and waste management projects syrian deputy prime minister abdallah al-dardari , who is largely considered responsible for syria 's economic reforms , took part in the talks that ended last week , the german development ministry said . but despite the continued efforts of syrian and german policymakers , syria still faces a number of challenges , including low investment levels , numerous poorly performing public sector firms , a low rate of industrial productivity and high unemployment . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reaffirmed her intention to visit syria in the first half of the year . debate has begun in several western capitals on how far relations with damascus should reach , as some , including the us administration , have accused syria of supporting terrorism . last week leading us democratic legislator nancy pelosi defended a controversial meeting with syria 's president bashar al-assad .
pelosi said she told assad he could achieve peace in the region if he stops supporting terrorism . " we have no illusions about the complexity of the challenges facing this region , but hope that recent diplomatic activity will generate some momentum for progress , " pelosi said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies could harvest profits from climate change the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .
two un inspectors have arrived in natanz for a week-long visit to the facility . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shrugs off threat of more united nations sanctions iran has shrugged off the threat of additional un security council sanctions over its nuclear program .

" hoeness said that heine , previously the coach of hertha 's third-division developmental team , would take over on the bench until at least the end of the season . götz 's firing followed an eight-game winless streak that saw hertha go from champions league aspirants to one of the bundesliga 's many candidates for the second division . götz had come under fire in recent weeks from critics who said the former hoeness protégé no longer commanded the respect of his players . fatal blow against bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker pantelic , left , has gone stone cold in 2007 hertha 's desultory draw against lowly bielefeld last weekend was typical of their play in 2007 . a listless hertha squad went behind in front of an enraged home crowd , and when götz substituted stars marko pantelic and kevin prince boateng out late in the match , neither seemed to acknowledge his presence . hertha then equalized and might have saved götz 's job if they 'd built on that momentum , but a scant one minute later , defender joe simunic - reportedly no great fan of the former skipper - got himself sent off , killing any chance of a come-from-behind victory . will hoeness be next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of hertha 's winless streak was a humiliating home loss to tiny cottbus new coach karsten heine , who has twice previously held the job with hertha , now has six games to steer berlin clear of the drop zone .
should he fail , hoeness himself would be in great danger of dismissal . once revered in berlin for leading hertha from the lower ranks of the second division to the champions league , hoeness has squandered the fans ' favor after investing millions in supposed stars who turned out to be flops . he has also repeatedly clashed with top players such as former playmaker marcelinho -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- and , this year , pantelic . heine 's attempts to steady hertha 's listing ship begin this weekend with a tough away match against improving bochum . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen closes the gap on league leader 's schalke werder bremen 's markus rosenberg secured a 1-0 win against nuremberg at home on sunday to bring the northern team to just two points behind bundesliga leaders schalke 04 .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

" if we are to halt global warning , we have to cut the emission of greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050 , " troge told the mass circulation bild newspaper . germany 's vibrant eco-industrial sector could potentially benefit from these measures .
according to munich-based business consultancy roland berger , germany - already the world 's top exporter - could experience an export-led boom in providing environmentally-friendly technology to the rest of the world . speaking to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , company head burkhard schwenker predicted turnover of a trillion euros for the green sector by 2030 , much of it in exports . germany is a world leader in green technologies that range from hi-tech refuse sorting to solar power cells .
almost half the world 's wind turbines contain german technology and every third solar cell carries the " made in germany " stamp .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

" the presidency of the european union has noted with great concern the announcement by iran that it intends to begin uranium enrichment on an industrial scale , " germany , the current eu president , said a statement on tuesday . " the presidency of the eu once again urges iran to comply with the demands of the international community and to create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table and for a solution to the conflict surrounding the iranian nuclear program . " iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that the country had set up an " industrial scale " operation to enrich uranium . enrichment remains sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could be on the way to enriching more uranium than the west thought possible experts said this would mean operating around 3,000 centrifuges to produce enriched uranium - nearly 10 times the number iran had previously declared . uranium enrichment is the key sticking point in the row between iran and the west because the process can also make the fissile core for an atomic bomb .
the western powers accuse tehran of seeking to make nuclear arms while tehran insists it is for power generation only . russia 's took a more restrained line .
a foreign ministry said tuesday that for the moment it saw no evidence that iran had made the breakthrough it claims in its nuclear fuel enrichment program . " we do not know of any recent technological breakthroughs in the iranian nuclear program that would change the character of the work in the field of enrichment , " ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . stiff response from west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its nuclear program is designed only to produce electricity but french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called iran 's announcement " a bad sign . " " i once again urge iran to respect security council resolutions , which demand the suspension of all sensitive nuclear activities , " he added . britain and the united states also issued robust responses . the united states on monday said making good on ahmadinejad 's claim would expose iran to tougher international pressure . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran was " almost completely encircled by the international community because of their actions , and that pressure is only going to increase if they persist . " a british foreign office spokesman said monday that iran 's latest declaration was a further breach of iaea and un resolutions . doubts over iran 's abilities remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced iran 's most recent claims are true iran defiance of western calls to suspend enrichment have earned it two sets of un sanctions since december . one us-based analyst also expressed doubt as to whether iran has begun to enrich uranium with their larger array of centrifuges . " the purpose today was to publicly state that they had the centrifuges , " said david albright , a former un nuclear inspector and now president of the washington-based institute for science and international security . " it would be a big surprise though if they did start to enrich , " he said , adding that putting the centrifuges into action would " seriously reduce their chances of having any meaningful negotiations with the europeans . " talks between the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , and iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , are expected to resume soon , though dates have not been announced . solana 's office said on tuesday that there was no way to verify iran 's claims unless international inspections were resumed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.04.2007 germany expands economic assistance to syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has offered 70 million euros in aid to syria over the next two years syria has enlisted the help of germany to push forward economic reforms and attract foreign investors .
in bilateral talks , germany has renewed its commitment to syrian development . negotiations between german and syrian officials ended in germany with a german pledge for 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- in development aid to syria for the next two years , the german ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- announced on tuesday . for years , german officials have been working with the syrian government and various economic institutions to ease syria 's transition to a social market economy .
the syrian economy has been managed centrally by the state since the 1960s , when the country nationalized most of its major enterprises .
designed to address regional and class disparities , this legacy of state intervention and price controls is now seen as hindering economic growth . the german strategy emphasizes the promotion of micro-credits to entrepreneurs unable to secure loans from commercial banks , according to the german development ministry .
germany co-founded syria 's first " micro-finance bank " and has supported various other initiatives , the ministry said . the ministry added that it has been asked to consult on the privatization of the syrian national bank , a step that , in addition to other market reforms , could pave the way for international investors to do more business with syrian firms . renewable energy helps syria , and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leading producer of solar cells , and might be shipping them to syria soon germany and syria also agreed to cooperate in the area of renewable energies and energy efficiency , two industrial branches where germany has been traditionally strong . although syria is a major exporter of crude oil and natural gas , its reserves are dwindling , so that " the use of wind energy and provisions in the area of building insulation are becoming increasingly important , " the german development ministry said . germany boasts one of the world 's leading renewable energy industries , but because german energy markets are mostly saturated , producers and distributors of renewable power are on the lookout for new openings in the developing world . germans will also be sharing their knowledge in the area of water management and sewage systems . syria faces challenges and more reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin also promised to aid syria in water and waste management projects syrian deputy prime minister abdallah al-dardari , who is largely considered responsible for syria 's economic reforms , took part in the talks that ended last week , the german development ministry said . but despite the continued efforts of syrian and german policymakers , syria still faces a number of challenges , including low investment levels , numerous poorly performing public sector firms , a low rate of industrial productivity and high unemployment . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reaffirmed her intention to visit syria in the first half of the year . debate has begun in several western capitals on how far relations with damascus should reach , as some , including the us administration , have accused syria of supporting terrorism . last week leading us democratic legislator nancy pelosi defended a controversial meeting with syria 's president bashar al-assad .
pelosi said she told assad he could achieve peace in the region if he stops supporting terrorism . " we have no illusions about the complexity of the challenges facing this region , but hope that recent diplomatic activity will generate some momentum for progress , " pelosi said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies could harvest profits from climate change the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 10.04.2007 germany expands economic assistance to syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has offered 70 million euros in aid to syria over the next two years syria has enlisted the help of germany to push forward economic reforms and attract foreign investors .
in bilateral talks , germany has renewed its commitment to syrian development . negotiations between german and syrian officials ended in germany with a german pledge for 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- in development aid to syria for the next two years , the german ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- announced on tuesday . for years , german officials have been working with the syrian government and various economic institutions to ease syria 's transition to a social market economy .
the syrian economy has been managed centrally by the state since the 1960s , when the country nationalized most of its major enterprises .
designed to address regional and class disparities , this legacy of state intervention and price controls is now seen as hindering economic growth . the german strategy emphasizes the promotion of micro-credits to entrepreneurs unable to secure loans from commercial banks , according to the german development ministry .
germany co-founded syria 's first " micro-finance bank " and has supported various other initiatives , the ministry said . the ministry added that it has been asked to consult on the privatization of the syrian national bank , a step that , in addition to other market reforms , could pave the way for international investors to do more business with syrian firms . renewable energy helps syria , and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leading producer of solar cells , and might be shipping them to syria soon germany and syria also agreed to cooperate in the area of renewable energies and energy efficiency , two industrial branches where germany has been traditionally strong . although syria is a major exporter of crude oil and natural gas , its reserves are dwindling , so that " the use of wind energy and provisions in the area of building insulation are becoming increasingly important , " the german development ministry said . germany boasts one of the world 's leading renewable energy industries , but because german energy markets are mostly saturated , producers and distributors of renewable power are on the lookout for new openings in the developing world . germans will also be sharing their knowledge in the area of water management and sewage systems . syria faces challenges and more reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin also promised to aid syria in water and waste management projects syrian deputy prime minister abdallah al-dardari , who is largely considered responsible for syria 's economic reforms , took part in the talks that ended last week , the german development ministry said . but despite the continued efforts of syrian and german policymakers , syria still faces a number of challenges , including low investment levels , numerous poorly performing public sector firms , a low rate of industrial productivity and high unemployment . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reaffirmed her intention to visit syria in the first half of the year . debate has begun in several western capitals on how far relations with damascus should reach , as some , including the us administration , have accused syria of supporting terrorism . last week leading us democratic legislator nancy pelosi defended a controversial meeting with syria 's president bashar al-assad .
pelosi said she told assad he could achieve peace in the region if he stops supporting terrorism . " we have no illusions about the complexity of the challenges facing this region , but hope that recent diplomatic activity will generate some momentum for progress , " pelosi said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies could harvest profits from climate change the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.04.2007 german companies could harvest profits from climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way forward for german business : environmentally-friendly technologies the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change . german federal environment agency head andreas troge said over the weekend that germany should start spending 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- a year in the fight against global warming in order to avoid costs 20 times that amount within a generation . " if we are to halt global warning , we have to cut the emission of greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050 , " troge told the mass circulation bild newspaper . germany 's vibrant eco-industrial sector could potentially benefit from these measures .
according to munich-based business consultancy roland berger , germany - already the world 's top exporter - could experience an export-led boom in providing environmentally-friendly technology to the rest of the world . speaking to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , company head burkhard schwenker predicted turnover of a trillion euros for the green sector by 2030 , much of it in exports . germany is a world leader in green technologies that range from hi-tech refuse sorting to solar power cells .
almost half the world 's wind turbines contain german technology and every third solar cell carries the " made in germany " stamp .
a new industrial revolution ?
environment minister sigmar gabriel , who has commissioned an eco-atlas from roland berger , believes a " third industrial revolution " is under way , with germany in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative energy sources , such as wood pellets , are gaining currency his comments appeared to be supported by data from the association of renewable energy , which estimated that its members exported to the tune of 6 billion euros last year , 30 percent more than in the previous year . roland berger consultants expect greater changes , forecasting that by 2020 , more families would be living off the income provided by green-tech than from machine tools or vehicle production - long the mainstays of the german economy . environmental technology already employs a million people , according to a survey by the company , and competition for skilled personnel is stiff .
china needs clean power german companies have been eyeing china with special interest .
china 's energy needs are estimated to be rising by 20 percent a year , and the population is suffering from the polluting effects of inefficient coal-fired electricity generation .

only five points from the drop zone , the club has axed coach falko götz in favor of karsten heine . commercial manager dieter hoeness announced the decision at a press conference on tuesday morning in berlin . " we came to the conclusion that falko götz was n't able to reach the team anymore , " hoeness said .
" there are no excuses anymore .
we know what the players are capable of and they need to perform . " hoeness said that heine , previously the coach of hertha 's third-division developmental team , would take over on the bench until at least the end of the season . götz 's firing followed an eight-game winless streak that saw hertha go from champions league aspirants to one of the bundesliga 's many candidates for the second division . götz had come under fire in recent weeks from critics who said the former hoeness protégé no longer commanded the respect of his players . fatal blow against bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker pantelic , left , has gone stone cold in 2007 hertha 's desultory draw against lowly bielefeld last weekend was typical of their play in 2007 . a listless hertha squad went behind in front of an enraged home crowd , and when götz substituted stars marko pantelic and kevin prince boateng out late in the match , neither seemed to acknowledge his presence . hertha then equalized and might have saved götz 's job if they 'd built on that momentum , but a scant one minute later , defender joe simunic - reportedly no great fan of the former skipper - got himself sent off , killing any chance of a come-from-behind victory . will hoeness be next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of hertha 's winless streak was a humiliating home loss to tiny cottbus new coach karsten heine , who has twice previously held the job with hertha , now has six games to steer berlin clear of the drop zone .
should he fail , hoeness himself would be in great danger of dismissal . once revered in berlin for leading hertha from the lower ranks of the second division to the champions league , hoeness has squandered the fans ' favor after investing millions in supposed stars who turned out to be flops . he has also repeatedly clashed with top players such as former playmaker marcelinho -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- and , this year , pantelic . heine 's attempts to steady hertha 's listing ship begin this weekend with a tough away match against improving bochum . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen closes the gap on league leader 's schalke werder bremen 's markus rosenberg secured a 1-0 win against nuremberg at home on sunday to bring the northern team to just two points behind bundesliga leaders schalke 04 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.04.2007 world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran said on monday that 3,000 centrifuges are now in operation iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .
the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement .

" the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .

" the presidency of the european union has noted with great concern the announcement by iran that it intends to begin uranium enrichment on an industrial scale , " germany , the current eu president , said a statement on tuesday . " the presidency of the eu once again urges iran to comply with the demands of the international community and to create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table and for a solution to the conflict surrounding the iranian nuclear program . " iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that the country had set up an " industrial scale " operation to enrich uranium . enrichment remains sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could be on the way to enriching more uranium than the west thought possible experts said this would mean operating around 3,000 centrifuges to produce enriched uranium - nearly 10 times the number iran had previously declared . uranium enrichment is the key sticking point in the row between iran and the west because the process can also make the fissile core for an atomic bomb .
the western powers accuse tehran of seeking to make nuclear arms while tehran insists it is for power generation only . russia 's took a more restrained line .
a foreign ministry said tuesday that for the moment it saw no evidence that iran had made the breakthrough it claims in its nuclear fuel enrichment program . " we do not know of any recent technological breakthroughs in the iranian nuclear program that would change the character of the work in the field of enrichment , " ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . stiff response from west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its nuclear program is designed only to produce electricity but french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called iran 's announcement " a bad sign . " " i once again urge iran to respect security council resolutions , which demand the suspension of all sensitive nuclear activities , " he added . britain and the united states also issued robust responses . the united states on monday said making good on ahmadinejad 's claim would expose iran to tougher international pressure . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran was " almost completely encircled by the international community because of their actions , and that pressure is only going to increase if they persist . " a british foreign office spokesman said monday that iran 's latest declaration was a further breach of iaea and un resolutions . doubts over iran 's abilities remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced iran 's most recent claims are true iran defiance of western calls to suspend enrichment have earned it two sets of un sanctions since december . one us-based analyst also expressed doubt as to whether iran has begun to enrich uranium with their larger array of centrifuges . " the purpose today was to publicly state that they had the centrifuges , " said david albright , a former un nuclear inspector and now president of the washington-based institute for science and international security . " it would be a big surprise though if they did start to enrich , " he said , adding that putting the centrifuges into action would " seriously reduce their chances of having any meaningful negotiations with the europeans . " talks between the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , and iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , are expected to resume soon , though dates have not been announced . solana 's office said on tuesday that there was no way to verify iran 's claims unless international inspections were resumed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .

" the presidency of the european union has noted with great concern the announcement by iran that it intends to begin uranium enrichment on an industrial scale , " germany , the current eu president , said a statement on tuesday . " the presidency of the eu once again urges iran to comply with the demands of the international community and to create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table and for a solution to the conflict surrounding the iranian nuclear program . " iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that the country had set up an " industrial scale " operation to enrich uranium . enrichment remains sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could be on the way to enriching more uranium than the west thought possible experts said this would mean operating around 3,000 centrifuges to produce enriched uranium - nearly 10 times the number iran had previously declared . uranium enrichment is the key sticking point in the row between iran and the west because the process can also make the fissile core for an atomic bomb .
the western powers accuse tehran of seeking to make nuclear arms while tehran insists it is for power generation only . russia 's took a more restrained line .
a foreign ministry said tuesday that for the moment it saw no evidence that iran had made the breakthrough it claims in its nuclear fuel enrichment program . " we do not know of any recent technological breakthroughs in the iranian nuclear program that would change the character of the work in the field of enrichment , " ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . stiff response from west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its nuclear program is designed only to produce electricity but french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called iran 's announcement " a bad sign . " " i once again urge iran to respect security council resolutions , which demand the suspension of all sensitive nuclear activities , " he added . britain and the united states also issued robust responses . the united states on monday said making good on ahmadinejad 's claim would expose iran to tougher international pressure . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran was " almost completely encircled by the international community because of their actions , and that pressure is only going to increase if they persist . " a british foreign office spokesman said monday that iran 's latest declaration was a further breach of iaea and un resolutions . doubts over iran 's abilities remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced iran 's most recent claims are true iran defiance of western calls to suspend enrichment have earned it two sets of un sanctions since december . one us-based analyst also expressed doubt as to whether iran has begun to enrich uranium with their larger array of centrifuges . " the purpose today was to publicly state that they had the centrifuges , " said david albright , a former un nuclear inspector and now president of the washington-based institute for science and international security . " it would be a big surprise though if they did start to enrich , " he said , adding that putting the centrifuges into action would " seriously reduce their chances of having any meaningful negotiations with the europeans . " talks between the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , and iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , are expected to resume soon , though dates have not been announced . solana 's office said on tuesday that there was no way to verify iran 's claims unless international inspections were resumed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.04.2007 götz gone as hertha prepare to fight relegation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz has little reason to celebrate right now hertha berlin were in fifth place at the break , but since then they compiled the worst record in the bundesliga .
only five points from the drop zone , the club has axed coach falko götz in favor of karsten heine . commercial manager dieter hoeness announced the decision at a press conference on tuesday morning in berlin . " we came to the conclusion that falko götz was n't able to reach the team anymore , " hoeness said .
" there are no excuses anymore .
we know what the players are capable of and they need to perform . " hoeness said that heine , previously the coach of hertha 's third-division developmental team , would take over on the bench until at least the end of the season . götz 's firing followed an eight-game winless streak that saw hertha go from champions league aspirants to one of the bundesliga 's many candidates for the second division . götz had come under fire in recent weeks from critics who said the former hoeness protégé no longer commanded the respect of his players . fatal blow against bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker pantelic , left , has gone stone cold in 2007 hertha 's desultory draw against lowly bielefeld last weekend was typical of their play in 2007 . a listless hertha squad went behind in front of an enraged home crowd , and when götz substituted stars marko pantelic and kevin prince boateng out late in the match , neither seemed to acknowledge his presence . hertha then equalized and might have saved götz 's job if they 'd built on that momentum , but a scant one minute later , defender joe simunic - reportedly no great fan of the former skipper - got himself sent off , killing any chance of a come-from-behind victory . will hoeness be next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of hertha 's winless streak was a humiliating home loss to tiny cottbus new coach karsten heine , who has twice previously held the job with hertha , now has six games to steer berlin clear of the drop zone .
should he fail , hoeness himself would be in great danger of dismissal . once revered in berlin for leading hertha from the lower ranks of the second division to the champions league , hoeness has squandered the fans ' favor after investing millions in supposed stars who turned out to be flops . he has also repeatedly clashed with top players such as former playmaker marcelinho -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- and , this year , pantelic . heine 's attempts to steady hertha 's listing ship begin this weekend with a tough away match against improving bochum . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen closes the gap on league leader 's schalke werder bremen 's markus rosenberg secured a 1-0 win against nuremberg at home on sunday to bring the northern team to just two points behind bundesliga leaders schalke 04 .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.04.2007 germany expands economic assistance to syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has offered 70 million euros in aid to syria over the next two years syria has enlisted the help of germany to push forward economic reforms and attract foreign investors .
in bilateral talks , germany has renewed its commitment to syrian development . negotiations between german and syrian officials ended in germany with a german pledge for 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- in development aid to syria for the next two years , the german ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- announced on tuesday . for years , german officials have been working with the syrian government and various economic institutions to ease syria 's transition to a social market economy .
the syrian economy has been managed centrally by the state since the 1960s , when the country nationalized most of its major enterprises .
designed to address regional and class disparities , this legacy of state intervention and price controls is now seen as hindering economic growth . the german strategy emphasizes the promotion of micro-credits to entrepreneurs unable to secure loans from commercial banks , according to the german development ministry .
germany co-founded syria 's first " micro-finance bank " and has supported various other initiatives , the ministry said . the ministry added that it has been asked to consult on the privatization of the syrian national bank , a step that , in addition to other market reforms , could pave the way for international investors to do more business with syrian firms . renewable energy helps syria , and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leading producer of solar cells , and might be shipping them to syria soon germany and syria also agreed to cooperate in the area of renewable energies and energy efficiency , two industrial branches where germany has been traditionally strong . although syria is a major exporter of crude oil and natural gas , its reserves are dwindling , so that " the use of wind energy and provisions in the area of building insulation are becoming increasingly important , " the german development ministry said . germany boasts one of the world 's leading renewable energy industries , but because german energy markets are mostly saturated , producers and distributors of renewable power are on the lookout for new openings in the developing world . germans will also be sharing their knowledge in the area of water management and sewage systems . syria faces challenges and more reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin also promised to aid syria in water and waste management projects syrian deputy prime minister abdallah al-dardari , who is largely considered responsible for syria 's economic reforms , took part in the talks that ended last week , the german development ministry said . but despite the continued efforts of syrian and german policymakers , syria still faces a number of challenges , including low investment levels , numerous poorly performing public sector firms , a low rate of industrial productivity and high unemployment . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reaffirmed her intention to visit syria in the first half of the year . debate has begun in several western capitals on how far relations with damascus should reach , as some , including the us administration , have accused syria of supporting terrorism . last week leading us democratic legislator nancy pelosi defended a controversial meeting with syria 's president bashar al-assad .
pelosi said she told assad he could achieve peace in the region if he stops supporting terrorism . " we have no illusions about the complexity of the challenges facing this region , but hope that recent diplomatic activity will generate some momentum for progress , " pelosi said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies could harvest profits from climate change the prophets of climate doom may dominate the country 's television screens , but many german companies are beginning to look to the profits that could be made from beating the threats posed by climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.04.2007 world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran said on monday that 3,000 centrifuges are now in operation iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .
the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

only five points from the drop zone , the club has axed coach falko götz in favor of karsten heine . commercial manager dieter hoeness announced the decision at a press conference on tuesday morning in berlin . " we came to the conclusion that falko götz was n't able to reach the team anymore , " hoeness said .
" there are no excuses anymore .
we know what the players are capable of and they need to perform . " hoeness said that heine , previously the coach of hertha 's third-division developmental team , would take over on the bench until at least the end of the season . götz 's firing followed an eight-game winless streak that saw hertha go from champions league aspirants to one of the bundesliga 's many candidates for the second division . götz had come under fire in recent weeks from critics who said the former hoeness protégé no longer commanded the respect of his players . fatal blow against bielefeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker pantelic , left , has gone stone cold in 2007 hertha 's desultory draw against lowly bielefeld last weekend was typical of their play in 2007 . a listless hertha squad went behind in front of an enraged home crowd , and when götz substituted stars marko pantelic and kevin prince boateng out late in the match , neither seemed to acknowledge his presence . hertha then equalized and might have saved götz 's job if they 'd built on that momentum , but a scant one minute later , defender joe simunic - reportedly no great fan of the former skipper - got himself sent off , killing any chance of a come-from-behind victory . will hoeness be next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of hertha 's winless streak was a humiliating home loss to tiny cottbus new coach karsten heine , who has twice previously held the job with hertha , now has six games to steer berlin clear of the drop zone .
should he fail , hoeness himself would be in great danger of dismissal . once revered in berlin for leading hertha from the lower ranks of the second division to the champions league , hoeness has squandered the fans ' favor after investing millions in supposed stars who turned out to be flops . he has also repeatedly clashed with top players such as former playmaker marcelinho -lrb- now at wolfsburg -rrb- and , this year , pantelic . heine 's attempts to steady hertha 's listing ship begin this weekend with a tough away match against improving bochum . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen closes the gap on league leader 's schalke werder bremen 's markus rosenberg secured a 1-0 win against nuremberg at home on sunday to bring the northern team to just two points behind bundesliga leaders schalke 04 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.04.2007 world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran said on monday that 3,000 centrifuges are now in operation iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .
the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .
two un inspectors have arrived in natanz for a week-long visit to the facility . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shrugs off threat of more united nations sanctions iran has shrugged off the threat of additional un security council sanctions over its nuclear program .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

" the presidency of the european union has noted with great concern the announcement by iran that it intends to begin uranium enrichment on an industrial scale , " germany , the current eu president , said a statement on tuesday . " the presidency of the eu once again urges iran to comply with the demands of the international community and to create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table and for a solution to the conflict surrounding the iranian nuclear program .

the western powers accuse tehran of seeking to make nuclear arms while tehran insists it is for power generation only . russia 's took a more restrained line .
a foreign ministry said tuesday that for the moment it saw no evidence that iran had made the breakthrough it claims in its nuclear fuel enrichment program .

" a british foreign office spokesman said monday that iran 's latest declaration was a further breach of iaea and un resolutions . doubts over iran 's abilities remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced iran 's most recent claims are true iran defiance of western calls to suspend enrichment have earned it two sets of un sanctions since december . one us-based analyst also expressed doubt as to whether iran has begun to enrich uranium with their larger array of centrifuges . " the purpose today was to publicly state that they had the centrifuges , " said david albright , a former un nuclear inspector and now president of the washington-based institute for science and international security . " it would be a big surprise though if they did start to enrich , " he said , adding that putting the centrifuges into action would " seriously reduce their chances of having any meaningful negotiations with the europeans .

" the presidency of the european union has noted with great concern the announcement by iran that it intends to begin uranium enrichment on an industrial scale , " germany , the current eu president , said a statement on tuesday . " the presidency of the eu once again urges iran to comply with the demands of the international community and to create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table and for a solution to the conflict surrounding the iranian nuclear program . " iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad announced on monday that the country had set up an " industrial scale " operation to enrich uranium . enrichment remains sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could be on the way to enriching more uranium than the west thought possible experts said this would mean operating around 3,000 centrifuges to produce enriched uranium - nearly 10 times the number iran had previously declared . uranium enrichment is the key sticking point in the row between iran and the west because the process can also make the fissile core for an atomic bomb .
the western powers accuse tehran of seeking to make nuclear arms while tehran insists it is for power generation only . russia 's took a more restrained line .
a foreign ministry said tuesday that for the moment it saw no evidence that iran had made the breakthrough it claims in its nuclear fuel enrichment program . " we do not know of any recent technological breakthroughs in the iranian nuclear program that would change the character of the work in the field of enrichment , " ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . stiff response from west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its nuclear program is designed only to produce electricity but french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called iran 's announcement " a bad sign . " " i once again urge iran to respect security council resolutions , which demand the suspension of all sensitive nuclear activities , " he added . britain and the united states also issued robust responses . the united states on monday said making good on ahmadinejad 's claim would expose iran to tougher international pressure . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran was " almost completely encircled by the international community because of their actions , and that pressure is only going to increase if they persist . " a british foreign office spokesman said monday that iran 's latest declaration was a further breach of iaea and un resolutions . doubts over iran 's abilities remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced iran 's most recent claims are true iran defiance of western calls to suspend enrichment have earned it two sets of un sanctions since december . one us-based analyst also expressed doubt as to whether iran has begun to enrich uranium with their larger array of centrifuges . " the purpose today was to publicly state that they had the centrifuges , " said david albright , a former un nuclear inspector and now president of the washington-based institute for science and international security . " it would be a big surprise though if they did start to enrich , " he said , adding that putting the centrifuges into action would " seriously reduce their chances of having any meaningful negotiations with the europeans . " talks between the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , and iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , are expected to resume soon , though dates have not been announced . solana 's office said on tuesday that there was no way to verify iran 's claims unless international inspections were resumed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world leaders condemn iran over nuclear expansion iran has come in for heavy international criticism after saying it had achieved the capacity to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .

the announcement has upped the stakes in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program . european and world leaders did not mince words after the claim , which was made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on monday at iran 's natanz nuclear facility . germany 's foreign ministry said tuesday that ahmadinejad 's plans were in direct contradiction with two resolutions made by the united nations security council and were of " great concern . " " such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated requests by the international atomic energy agency 's board of governors and of the binding demands of the un security council 's resolutions 1737 and 1747 on iran to cease all enrichment activities , " a ministry statement read . currently president of both the european union and group of eight industrialized nations , berlin also called on iran to return to negotiations concerning its nuclear program . the foreign policy spokesman for the government 's conservative faction in germany , eckart von klaeden , said that nato should intensify its discussions about security following the announcement . " in my opinion , iran is the biggest danger to world peace at the moment , " klaeden said in a radio interview . russia , which has previously helped iran in developing nuclear technology , echoed those sentiments .
konstantin kosachov , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the russian parliament , called iran 's announcement " a direct challenge to the world community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz facility is largely underground a british foreign office spokesman added that the international community " stands together in ensuring that iran does not develop the means to acquire nuclear weapons . " un secretary general ban ki-moon and the united states have also expressed serious concerns at iran 's insistence on expanding its nuclear program . tehran remains defiant but the flurry of warnings has had little effect on iran 's leaders .
on tuesday , the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , gholam reza aghazadeh , said the country would drastically increase its number of centrifuges , which are essential in the enrichment of uranium . " the objective of the islamic republic of iran is not just the installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the natanz plant , " aghazadeh said .
" we are doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges . " iran insists that its nuclear program is aimed at producing energy , not weapons , and says that it has the right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
but the us and many european countries suspect tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . enriched uranium is used for producing nuclear fuel , but if the level of enrichment is increased it can be used to build weaponry . scepticism about claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran already faces un sanctions for pressing ahead with its nuclear program but there are questions as to whether iran truly has achieved the sort of major breakthrough it announced on monday .
the russian foreign ministry said it has no evidence to support tehran 's claims . and american experts also expressed strong doubts as to whether iran had really mastered the highly complicated process of operating so many centrifuges simultaneously .
" i do n't believe they have 3,000 up and running in any reasonable sense , " said michael levi , a non-proliferation expert at the washington-based council on foreign relations . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international nuclear energy agency has said some 60,000 centrifuges are needed to operate an industrial-scale uranium enrichment for fuel production .

in bilateral talks , germany has renewed its commitment to syrian development . negotiations between german and syrian officials ended in germany with a german pledge for 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- in development aid to syria for the next two years , the german ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- announced on tuesday . for years , german officials have been working with the syrian government and various economic institutions to ease syria 's transition to a social market economy .
the syrian economy has been managed centrally by the state since the 1960s , when the country nationalized most of its major enterprises .
designed to address regional and class disparities , this legacy of state intervention and price controls is now seen as hindering economic growth . the german strategy emphasizes the promotion of micro-credits to entrepreneurs unable to secure loans from commercial banks , according to the german development ministry .
germany co-founded syria 's first " micro-finance bank " and has supported various other initiatives , the ministry said . the ministry added that it has been asked to consult on the privatization of the syrian national bank , a step that , in addition to other market reforms , could pave the way for international investors to do more business with syrian firms . renewable energy helps syria , and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leading producer of solar cells , and might be shipping them to syria soon germany and syria also agreed to cooperate in the area of renewable energies and energy efficiency , two industrial branches where germany has been traditionally strong . although syria is a major exporter of crude oil and natural gas , its reserves are dwindling , so that " the use of wind energy and provisions in the area of building insulation are becoming increasingly important , " the german development ministry said . germany boasts one of the world 's leading renewable energy industries , but because german energy markets are mostly saturated , producers and distributors of renewable power are on the lookout for new openings in the developing world . germans will also be sharing their knowledge in the area of water management and sewage systems . syria faces challenges and more reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin also promised to aid syria in water and waste management projects syrian deputy prime minister abdallah al-dardari , who is largely considered responsible for syria 's economic reforms , took part in the talks that ended last week , the german development ministry said . but despite the continued efforts of syrian and german policymakers , syria still faces a number of challenges , including low investment levels , numerous poorly performing public sector firms , a low rate of industrial productivity and high unemployment . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reaffirmed her intention to visit syria in the first half of the year . debate has begun in several western capitals on how far relations with damascus should reach , as some , including the us administration , have accused syria of supporting terrorism . last week leading us democratic legislator nancy pelosi defended a controversial meeting with syria 's president bashar al-assad .

' cruel and relentless ' addressing the annual conference of the nasuwt teachers ' union , mr johnson highlighted new powers for teachers to confiscate mobile phones and mp3 players used for such abuse .
he told delegates : " cyber bullying is cruel and relentless , able to follow a child beyond the school gates and into their homes .
" the online harassment of teachers is causing some to consider leaving the profession because of the defamation and humiliation they are forced to suffer . "
he urged the providers of websites to " take firmer action to block or remove offensive school videos in the same way that they have commendably cut pornographic content " .
" by removing the platform , we 'll blunt the appeal . "
web providers , many of whom the government works with on its cyber-bullying task force , have a " wider responsibility " to consider the harm that offensive like videos of teachers or pupils often filmed on mobile phones can cause , he added .

in response to questions about youtube and google not being on the government 's cyberbullying task force , mr johnson said he would be asking the web firms to join the panel once again .
teachers have been calling for tougher restrictions to be put in place to prevent them being targeted by online bullies .
they claim offensive videos of them being abused , bullied and derided by pupils affect their ability to command respect in the classroom and causes them pain .
ratemyteachers website , which has been criticised by teachers ' leaders , insists that it does read and moderate comments about teachers and argues 70 % of its postings are positive .

managers told the cbi they believed many employees faked illness to take a monday or friday off work .
it said employers must clamp down on staff taking " sickies " which it said cost the economy about £ 1.6bn.
about 400 employers were surveyed .
they said they believed that 12 % of days off taken by workers were not genuine .
but in response , the tuc said that " unsympathetic " bosses meant many ill employees went to work .
the survey suggested there was a correlation between absences and major sporting events .
' extra holiday ' overall workplace absence , including genuine illness , cost the economy about £ 13.4bn in 2006 , the cbi added .
workers took an average of seven days off sick in 2006 , it said . "
there is a culture of absenteeism in some workplaces that must be addressed " susan anderson , cbi this was about half a day more than in the previous year and equated to the loss of 175 million working days .
public sector workers had the highest average absence at nine days per worker .
this was 44 % higher than in the private sector , despite government efforts to trim the number of days taken off sick , the cbi said .
some workers felt they had the right to use sickies to give themselves a long weekend or a longer holiday , said the cbi 's director of human resources policy , susan anderson .
as well as the financial burden , this put pressure on colleagues , she said .
" everybody gets sick and employers understand that most absence is genuine , " ms anderson said .
" it is in no-one 's interest if staff come to work when they are not well , " she said .
" but there is a culture of absenteeism in some workplaces that must be addressed . "
the variation in absenteeism showed that some firms were managing the problem better than others , she added .
' tiny minority ' but tuc general secretary brendan barber said that most people who took time off sick were genuinely ill .
staff often came into work when sick because of the " unsympathetic " attitude of bosses to people phoning in sick , he said .
" every organisation should have a sickness absence policy that allows staff to take days off work without feeling guilty as well as dealing fairly with the tiny minority who take sickness leave that is not genuine , " mr barber said .
last year , the amicus union was involved in a row with employers after it was accused of advising people how to take sickies to watch the world cup .
on its website , the union said it was " difficult to prove someone is not really sick " and offered a line of defence to workers who are caught out .

the code was drawn up by web pioneer tim o 'reilly following published threats and perceived harassment to us developer kathy sierra on blogs .
the code begins : " we celebrate the blogosphere because it embraces frank and open conversation . "
the draft says people should not be allowed to leave anonymous comments .
blogs which are open and uncensored should post an " anything goes " logo to the site to warn readers , the code suggests .
readers of these blogs would be warned : " we are not responsible for the comments of any poster , and when discussions get heated , crude language , insults and other " off colour " comments may be encountered .
participate in this site at your own risk . "
the draft will now be assessed and amended by bloggers around the world .
the code states : " we are committed to the ' civility enforced ' standard : we will not post unacceptable content , and we 'll delete comments that contain it . "
the draft defines unacceptable content as anything included or linked to that is being used to " abuse , harass , stalk , or threaten others " .
kathy sierra has been terrified by death threats it also refers to libellous material , infringement of copyright or trademark and violations of privacy .
prominent blogger kathy sierra called on the blogosphere to combat the culture of abuse online after a series of death threats forced her to cancel a public appearance and suspend her blog .
ms sierra described on her blog how she had been subject to a campaign of threats , including a post that featured a picture of her next to a noose .
at the heart of the issue is the degree of freedom afforded to people who want to comment on blog posts .
" if those published comments could be construed as a threat , and the perpetrator does n't withdraw them and apologise , we will cooperate with law enforcement to protect the target of the threat , " the code states .
the code has had mixed support among bloggers .
jimmy wales , the co-founder of wikipedia , told bbc radio 5 live 's pods and blogs programme : " the question is : do we allow people to use our blogs as places to embark on threatening behaviour and really abusive personal insults ?
" you do n't have to insult people to be frank . "
but the code was not welcome by blogger and commentator jeff jarvis , who called it " misguided " .
on his blog , he wrote : " this effort misses the point of the internet , blogs , and even of civilized behavior .
they treat the blogosphere as if it were a school library where someone ... can maintain order and control .
they treat it as a medium for media .
" it 's a place .
and when i moved into the place that is my town , i did n't put up a badge on my fence saying that i 'd be a good neighbor . "
he added : " i do n't need anyone lecturing me and telling me not to be disagreeable . "

ms sierra described on her blog how she had been subject to a campaign of threats , including a post that featured a picture of her next to a noose .
at the heart of the issue is the degree of freedom afforded to people who want to comment on blog posts .
" if those published comments could be construed as a threat , and the perpetrator does n't withdraw them and apologise , we will cooperate with law enforcement to protect the target of the threat , " the code states .
the code has had mixed support among bloggers .
jimmy wales , the co-founder of wikipedia , told bbc radio 5 live 's pods and blogs programme : " the question is : do we allow people to use our blogs as places to embark on threatening behaviour and really abusive personal insults ?
" you do n't have to insult people to be frank . "
but the code was not welcome by blogger and commentator jeff jarvis , who called it " misguided " .
on his blog , he wrote : " this effort misses the point of the internet , blogs , and even of civilized behavior .
they treat the blogosphere as if it were a school library where someone ... can maintain order and control .
they treat it as a medium for media .
" it 's a place .
and when i moved into the place that is my town , i did n't put up a badge on my fence saying that i 'd be a good neighbor . "
he added : " i do n't need anyone lecturing me and telling me not to be disagreeable . "

the code was drawn up by web pioneer tim o 'reilly following published threats and perceived harassment to us developer kathy sierra on blogs .
the code begins : " we celebrate the blogosphere because it embraces frank and open conversation . "
the draft says people should not be allowed to leave anonymous comments .
blogs which are open and uncensored should post an " anything goes " logo to the site to warn readers , the code suggests .
readers of these blogs would be warned : " we are not responsible for the comments of any poster , and when discussions get heated , crude language , insults and other " off colour " comments may be encountered .
participate in this site at your own risk . "
the draft will now be assessed and amended by bloggers around the world .
the code states : " we are committed to the ' civility enforced ' standard : we will not post unacceptable content , and we 'll delete comments that contain it . "
the draft defines unacceptable content as anything included or linked to that is being used to " abuse , harass , stalk , or threaten others " .
kathy sierra has been terrified by death threats it also refers to libellous material , infringement of copyright or trademark and violations of privacy .
prominent blogger kathy sierra called on the blogosphere to combat the culture of abuse online after a series of death threats forced her to cancel a public appearance and suspend her blog .
ms sierra described on her blog how she had been subject to a campaign of threats , including a post that featured a picture of her next to a noose .
at the heart of the issue is the degree of freedom afforded to people who want to comment on blog posts .
" if those published comments could be construed as a threat , and the perpetrator does n't withdraw them and apologise , we will cooperate with law enforcement to protect the target of the threat , " the code states .
the code has had mixed support among bloggers .
jimmy wales , the co-founder of wikipedia , told bbc radio 5 live 's pods and blogs programme : " the question is : do we allow people to use our blogs as places to embark on threatening behaviour and really abusive personal insults ?
" you do n't have to insult people to be frank . "
but the code was not welcome by blogger and commentator jeff jarvis , who called it " misguided " .
on his blog , he wrote : " this effort misses the point of the internet , blogs , and even of civilized behavior .
they treat the blogosphere as if it were a school library where someone ... can maintain order and control .
they treat it as a medium for media .
" it 's a place .
and when i moved into the place that is my town , i did n't put up a badge on my fence saying that i 'd be a good neighbor . "
he added : " i do n't need anyone lecturing me and telling me not to be disagreeable . "

the american legislation gives parents access to information on paedophiles living in their community .
last year , home secretary john reid said he was sending a minister to the us to examine how megan 's law works .
the law was signed by president bill clinton in 1997 and has since been adopted in some form by all 50 states .
it arose from the rape and murder of seven-year-old megan kanka .
she was killed by jesse timmendequas , a known child molester with two previous convictions for sexual offences .
he had moved into the same neighbourhood as her family without their knowledge .
the murder caused outrage in the us and megan 's parents campaigned for a change in the law to give parents access to information on child sex offenders in their area .
parents must now be informed when offenders move into their neighbourhood after being freed from prison .
divided opinions a number of states list offenders ' details on the internet , allowing parents to enter their own details to check if anyone on the register has moved in nearby .
supporters of the law point to cases where registered sex offenders have been discovered working in amusement parks , youth counselling and other activities involving contact with children .
one californian grandmother told how she had checked the database after growing suspicious that her daughter-in-law , and mother of her four grandchildren , had re-married a convicted sex offender .
" i said , ' what if he 's a rapist ? ' and sure as hell , he was . "
but opponents argue the law encourages acts of vigilantism and does not give offenders who have paid their dues the chance to merge back into society .
they also question the effectiveness of megan 's law .
past studies have shown that far fewer paedophiles comply with registration requirements in the us than in the uk .
critics also point out that most cases of child abuse occur within the family , and suggest that victims may stay silent if they know a family member will be denounced .
state differences offenders must register their address with the local police upon release from prison , but many give bogus details .
others have given their details , but travelled outside their local areas to prey on youngsters in neighbourhoods where no-one knew about them .
the law takes different forms in different states .
in louisiana , the public has complete access to information on offenders and their movements .
one company offers e-mail alerts to families warning of sex offenders moving to homes near them .
in washington state , law enforcement officers can call at every house in the neighbourhood to warn people about an offender moving in .
sex offenders in oregon can be forced to display a sign in their windows .
some believe that megan 's law does not go far enough and several states are investigating the use of , or have already introduced , chemical or surgical castration for certain sexual offenders .

the american legislation gives parents access to information on paedophiles living in their community .
last year , home secretary john reid said he was sending a minister to the us to examine how megan 's law works .
the law was signed by president bill clinton in 1997 and has since been adopted in some form by all 50 states .
it arose from the rape and murder of seven-year-old megan kanka .
she was killed by jesse timmendequas , a known child molester with two previous convictions for sexual offences .
he had moved into the same neighbourhood as her family without their knowledge .
the murder caused outrage in the us and megan 's parents campaigned for a change in the law to give parents access to information on child sex offenders in their area .
parents must now be informed when offenders move into their neighbourhood after being freed from prison .
divided opinions a number of states list offenders ' details on the internet , allowing parents to enter their own details to check if anyone on the register has moved in nearby .

critics also point out that most cases of child abuse occur within the family , and suggest that victims may stay silent if they know a family member will be denounced .
state differences offenders must register their address with the local police upon release from prison , but many give bogus details .
others have given their details , but travelled outside their local areas to prey on youngsters in neighbourhoods where no-one knew about them .
the law takes different forms in different states .
in louisiana , the public has complete access to information on offenders and their movements .

in washington state , law enforcement officers can call at every house in the neighbourhood to warn people about an offender moving in .

last year , home secretary john reid said he was sending a minister to the us to examine how megan 's law works .
the law was signed by president bill clinton in 1997 and has since been adopted in some form by all 50 states .
it arose from the rape and murder of seven-year-old megan kanka .
she was killed by jesse timmendequas , a known child molester with two previous convictions for sexual offences .
he had moved into the same neighbourhood as her family without their knowledge .
the murder caused outrage in the us and megan 's parents campaigned for a change in the law to give parents access to information on child sex offenders in their area .
parents must now be informed when offenders move into their neighbourhood after being freed from prison .
divided opinions a number of states list offenders ' details on the internet , allowing parents to enter their own details to check if anyone on the register has moved in nearby .
supporters of the law point to cases where registered sex offenders have been discovered working in amusement parks , youth counselling and other activities involving contact with children .
one californian grandmother told how she had checked the database after growing suspicious that her daughter-in-law , and mother of her four grandchildren , had re-married a convicted sex offender .
" i said , ' what if he 's a rapist ? ' and sure as hell , he was . "
but opponents argue the law encourages acts of vigilantism and does not give offenders who have paid their dues the chance to merge back into society .
they also question the effectiveness of megan 's law .
past studies have shown that far fewer paedophiles comply with registration requirements in the us than in the uk .
critics also point out that most cases of child abuse occur within the family , and suggest that victims may stay silent if they know a family member will be denounced .
state differences offenders must register their address with the local police upon release from prison , but many give bogus details .
others have given their details , but travelled outside their local areas to prey on youngsters in neighbourhoods where no-one knew about them .
the law takes different forms in different states .
in louisiana , the public has complete access to information on offenders and their movements .
one company offers e-mail alerts to families warning of sex offenders moving to homes near them .
in washington state , law enforcement officers can call at every house in the neighbourhood to warn people about an offender moving in .
sex offenders in oregon can be forced to display a sign in their windows .
some believe that megan 's law does not go far enough and several states are investigating the use of , or have already introduced , chemical or surgical castration for certain sexual offenders .
