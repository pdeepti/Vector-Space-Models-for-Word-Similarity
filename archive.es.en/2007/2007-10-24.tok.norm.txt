it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 24.10.2007 german politicians present plan for post-wwii expellee memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only part of anhalter station survived wwii bombings ; now it could be a memorial site german politicians have developed a concept for a controversial documentation center for wartime expulsions in berlin and will present it to the cabinet for approval by the end of the year . days after german chancellor angela merkel said she wanted a " visible symbol " in berlin to mark the fate of millions of people displaced after world war two , members of her government said they had come up with a concept for a controversial documentation center in berlin towards that purpose . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper quoted wolfgang thierse , vice president of the lower house of parliament , as saying there were plans for setting up an independent foundation under the aegis of the german historical museum in berlin .
it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .
" this law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology , " said arnaud montebourg of the opposition socialists .

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .
" this law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology , " said arnaud montebourg of the opposition socialists .
test used in 11 eu nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy ca n't understand why the issue has raised such a storm in france the dna testing technique , which is widely used on criminals , builds on sarkozy 's campaign promise to toughen immigration rules .
its supporters say it will help speed up the process for genuine applicants and they cite similar laws in other european countries .
" this dna test exists in 11 countries in europe - including some socialist ones , like great britain , " president sarkozy said in a recent television interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 24.10.2007 restorers fight to save books from ' goethe 's library ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faulty wiring probably caused the massive blaze a fire at weimar 's historic anna amalia library destroyed some 60,000 books and damaged 118,000 others in 2004 .
ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .
but i 'm really looking forward to wednesday .
it will be one of the best days of my life , whereas the day of the fire was one of the blackest . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , chinese goods worth 48.8 billion euros amounted to 6.7 percent of all products imported into germany .
only france and the netherlands exported more to germany in the same period .
until ten years ago , chinese exports made up just 2.6 percent of overall exports to germany , according to statistics .
chinese threads and toys popular german consumers ' appetite for all things made in china is especially evident in clothing , shoes , toys and electronic products , the figures showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china-made shoes make up 29 percent of textile imports last year , a fourth of all imported textiles came from china while leather goods such as shoes made up 29 percent .
notwithstanding the recent scares surrounding chinese-made toys , last year 60 percent of all toys and games imported into the country by german companies originated in chinese factories .
the same trend is underway in the high-tech electronics market , statisticians said .
since 1996 , gadgets made in china are increasingly popular in germany with television sets , radios and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics heading the list .
statisticians said computers made in china are also increasingly breaking into the german market .
it 's estimated that every third computer sold in germany is manufactured in china .
one-way street the flood of goods from china to germany seems however to be a one-way flow .
the asian country is also rated number 11 when it comes to importing german goods .
last year , germany exported products worth 27.5 billion euros to china .
however , the figures do n't include german cars , for instance , that are assembled in china . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's leaders also met to consider whether to launch cross-border operations . the european union reiterated its calls for restraint as turkish warplanes reportedly bombed kurdish rebel targets along the iraqi border on wednesday , oct .
24 , and government and military leaders met to consider whether to launch operations across the frontier .
the european union , which turkey hopes to join , called on ankara to refrain from unilateral military action and to give diplomacy a chance .
" turkey should think twice before launching a military intervention , " manuel lobo antunes , the european affairs minister of portugal , which currently holds the eu presidency , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called on ankara and baghdad to work in cooperation and in accordance with international law when dealing with the attacks on turkish troops by iraqi kurdish rebels .
the european union " condemns all terrorist attacks and understands turkey 's need to protect its citizens , " rehn told the same session of the european parliament .
" but we also urge turkey to seek a political solution in cooperation with iraq , regional authorities and the international community and to show a sense of proportionality in its response to pkk terrorism . "
the eu was joined by the united states in calling for diplomatic efforts to replace military action .
" we are concerned about the continuing skirmishes that are happening up there , and terrorist attacks that are being launched by the pkk against the turks , " said white house spokeswoman dana perino .
" we continue to urge both sides to exercise restraint . "
us warns of potential escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish build-up is causing international concern the us also expressed worries that renewed fighting could lead to " escalating tensions " between turkey and iraq .
meanwhile , daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , said in berlin that the kurdish administration in iraq 's autonomous north must to do more to weed out pkk rebels .
" it is in the interests of the kurdish residents of iraq that these terrorist attacks stop and that turkey and iraq become good neighbors . "
according to reports , turkish fighter jets bombed and destroyed several kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- mountain positions in sirnak , hakkari , siirt and van provinces , which are on the borders with iraq and iran , the semi-official anatolia news agency said .
the reports stated that helicopter gunships also took part in the raids that followed the killing of 12 soldiers in a pkk ambush near the iraqi border on sunday .
the pkk said it captured eight soldiers in the clashes .
another operation against the pkk , backed by air cover , was underway in the eastern province of tunceli , anatolia said , adding that suspected pkk militants detonated two remote-control bombs as soldiers combed a rural area for landmines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops have already carried out a number of missions the military said 34 pkk militants had been killed in operations since sunday 's attack , which increased pressure on ankara for a military incursion into northern iraq , where the rebels take refuge .
last week , the turkish parliament authorized the government to order cross-border military strikes against the separatist camps .
turkey considers next move the new international appeals for restraint , and signs that baghdad might hand some rebels over to prevent a turkish military strike , prompted the national security council of top military officers and senior ministers , led by president abdullah gül , to meet and consider its next step .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali babacan , left , with president abdullah gul during high-level talks in baghdad , iraqi president jalal talabani told turkish foreign minister ali babacan that he " did not exclude the possibility " of extraditing separatist fighters when the two met in baghdad on tuesday , a turkish government source said .
babacan said iraq should hand over about 100 pkk members whose names figured on a list sent to baghdad earlier this year , added the source .
the issue will be taken up during talks in ankara on thursday with an iraqi security delegation .
babacan added that ankara would not flinch from military action if iraq and the united states did not clamp down on pkk bases in northern iraq .
turkey has long demanded that iraq prevent the pkk - which has been fighting for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1984 - from using its territory , cut off logistical support and hand over rebel leaders to turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massoud barzani , left , with iraqi president talabani massud barzani , president of iraqi kurdistan , on wednesday urged the pkk to end its armed struggle .
" we do not accept in any way ... the use of iraqi territories , including the territories of the kurdistan region , as a base to threaten the security of neighboring countries , " barzani said in a statement .

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.10.2007 french parliament passes controversial dna bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't touch my dna , " read the banners protesting the tests in paris the french parliament passed a new immigration bill tightening the conditions under which immigrants ' families may join them in france , including deeply controversial voluntary dna tests to verify family ties . the controversial measure , which critics say is racist and which sparked large street protests in paris last weekend , passed by 282 votes to 235 in the lower chamber of parliament , the national assembly , and by 185 votes to 136 in the upper chamber , the senate .
the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .
" this law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology , " said arnaud montebourg of the opposition socialists .
test used in 11 eu nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy ca n't understand why the issue has raised such a storm in france the dna testing technique , which is widely used on criminals , builds on sarkozy 's campaign promise to toughen immigration rules .
its supporters say it will help speed up the process for genuine applicants and they cite similar laws in other european countries .
" this dna test exists in 11 countries in europe - including some socialist ones , like great britain , " president sarkozy said in a recent television interview .

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .
but i 'm really looking forward to wednesday .
it will be one of the best days of my life , whereas the day of the fire was one of the blackest . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'll not table a rotation plan , i 'll mention it and i hope that me mentioning it and possibly ministers discussing this will have some impact , " he said ahead of talks with the ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai -lrb- r -rrb- with isaf troops in kabul later , at the start of talks , scheffer said : " our top priority today is afghanistan , where we are supporting the united nations ' efforts under a un mandate , " according to dpa . the united states has urged its european allies to provide more troops to fight taliban militants . isaf commanders want more troops currently , the us , british , canadian and dutch troops are bearing most of the burden of fighting militants in the volatile south and east of afghanistan . commanders with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- have asked for more combat troops and aircraft , particularly helicopters , to confront the taliban insurgency .
however , many allies - including germany - do not want to deploy soldiers to the most dangerous areas , like the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say afghan national army soldiers must be trained before an exit of western troops one nato official told afp that a rotation system would allow countries to plan their future troop movements more efficiently and would encourage allies to extend their stay in afghanistan .
should the plan be agreed upon , the official said it was unlikely that the plan would be initiated within a year . according to reuters news agency , us defense secretary robert gates accused allies on monday that they were not fulfilling their promises to supply troops , equipment and trainers for the national army in afghanistan . experts have said the training of the army is necessary before an exit strategy for western troops could be planned . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .

last year , chinese goods worth 48.8 billion euros amounted to 6.7 percent of all products imported into germany .
only france and the netherlands exported more to germany in the same period .
until ten years ago , chinese exports made up just 2.6 percent of overall exports to germany , according to statistics .
chinese threads and toys popular german consumers ' appetite for all things made in china is especially evident in clothing , shoes , toys and electronic products , the figures showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china-made shoes make up 29 percent of textile imports last year , a fourth of all imported textiles came from china while leather goods such as shoes made up 29 percent .
notwithstanding the recent scares surrounding chinese-made toys , last year 60 percent of all toys and games imported into the country by german companies originated in chinese factories .
the same trend is underway in the high-tech electronics market , statisticians said .
since 1996 , gadgets made in china are increasingly popular in germany with television sets , radios and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics heading the list .
statisticians said computers made in china are also increasingly breaking into the german market .
it 's estimated that every third computer sold in germany is manufactured in china .
one-way street the flood of goods from china to germany seems however to be a one-way flow .
the asian country is also rated number 11 when it comes to importing german goods .

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .
but i 'm really looking forward to wednesday .
it will be one of the best days of my life , whereas the day of the fire was one of the blackest . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .

but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .
but i 'm really looking forward to wednesday .
it will be one of the best days of my life , whereas the day of the fire was one of the blackest . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .
" this law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology , " said arnaud montebourg of the opposition socialists .

babacan added that ankara would not flinch from military action if iraq and the united states did not clamp down on pkk bases in northern iraq .

" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .

while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .

it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the film will be subtitled in 22 languages . turkish-born fatih akin , the german director of the winning film " the edge of heaven , " won the european parliament 's first lux prize for cinema wednesday .
the lux award and its tower of babel-inspired trophy means the german-language film will now be subtitled in all 22 other official eu languages .
in akin 's absence , eu parliament president hans-gert pöttering presented the award , which looks like a stacked-up roll of film , to the film 's leading actress hanna schygulla , known from her work with german filmmaker rainer werner fassbinder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannah schygulla -lrb- middle -rrb- is the film 's leading actress pöttering told news agencies that he had not seen the three films which were shortlisted for the prize , and therefore had been unable to cast a vote with his fellow meps .
however he stressed that the aim of the prize was " to illustrate the linguistic richness and artistic creativity " of european cinema .
the film portrays a turkish widower who decided to move in with a prostitute despite his son 's misgivings .
second in a trilogy the son , a young german teacher , warms to the new woman in his father 's life , yeter , when he realises that she sends most of what she earns to her daughter in turkey to pay for her university education .
yeter 's accidental death drives a wedge between father and son and leads them both back to istanbul .

last year , chinese goods worth 48.8 billion euros amounted to 6.7 percent of all products imported into germany .
only france and the netherlands exported more to germany in the same period .
until ten years ago , chinese exports made up just 2.6 percent of overall exports to germany , according to statistics .
chinese threads and toys popular german consumers ' appetite for all things made in china is especially evident in clothing , shoes , toys and electronic products , the figures showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china-made shoes make up 29 percent of textile imports last year , a fourth of all imported textiles came from china while leather goods such as shoes made up 29 percent .
notwithstanding the recent scares surrounding chinese-made toys , last year 60 percent of all toys and games imported into the country by german companies originated in chinese factories .
the same trend is underway in the high-tech electronics market , statisticians said .
since 1996 , gadgets made in china are increasingly popular in germany with television sets , radios and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics heading the list .
statisticians said computers made in china are also increasingly breaking into the german market .
it 's estimated that every third computer sold in germany is manufactured in china .
one-way street the flood of goods from china to germany seems however to be a one-way flow .
the asian country is also rated number 11 when it comes to importing german goods .
last year , germany exported products worth 27.5 billion euros to china .
however , the figures do n't include german cars , for instance , that are assembled in china . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .

i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .
but i 'm really looking forward to wednesday .
it will be one of the best days of my life , whereas the day of the fire was one of the blackest . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .
but i 'm really looking forward to wednesday .
it will be one of the best days of my life , whereas the day of the fire was one of the blackest . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .
but i 'm really looking forward to wednesday .
it will be one of the best days of my life , whereas the day of the fire was one of the blackest . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .

turkey 's leaders also met to consider whether to launch cross-border operations . the european union reiterated its calls for restraint as turkish warplanes reportedly bombed kurdish rebel targets along the iraqi border on wednesday , oct .
24 , and government and military leaders met to consider whether to launch operations across the frontier .
the european union , which turkey hopes to join , called on ankara to refrain from unilateral military action and to give diplomacy a chance .
" turkey should think twice before launching a military intervention , " manuel lobo antunes , the european affairs minister of portugal , which currently holds the eu presidency , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called on ankara and baghdad to work in cooperation and in accordance with international law when dealing with the attacks on turkish troops by iraqi kurdish rebels .
the european union " condemns all terrorist attacks and understands turkey 's need to protect its citizens , " rehn told the same session of the european parliament .
" but we also urge turkey to seek a political solution in cooperation with iraq , regional authorities and the international community and to show a sense of proportionality in its response to pkk terrorism . "
the eu was joined by the united states in calling for diplomatic efforts to replace military action .
" we are concerned about the continuing skirmishes that are happening up there , and terrorist attacks that are being launched by the pkk against the turks , " said white house spokeswoman dana perino .
" we continue to urge both sides to exercise restraint . "
us warns of potential escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish build-up is causing international concern the us also expressed worries that renewed fighting could lead to " escalating tensions " between turkey and iraq .
meanwhile , daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , said in berlin that the kurdish administration in iraq 's autonomous north must to do more to weed out pkk rebels .
" it is in the interests of the kurdish residents of iraq that these terrorist attacks stop and that turkey and iraq become good neighbors . "
according to reports , turkish fighter jets bombed and destroyed several kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- mountain positions in sirnak , hakkari , siirt and van provinces , which are on the borders with iraq and iran , the semi-official anatolia news agency said .
the reports stated that helicopter gunships also took part in the raids that followed the killing of 12 soldiers in a pkk ambush near the iraqi border on sunday .
the pkk said it captured eight soldiers in the clashes .
another operation against the pkk , backed by air cover , was underway in the eastern province of tunceli , anatolia said , adding that suspected pkk militants detonated two remote-control bombs as soldiers combed a rural area for landmines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops have already carried out a number of missions the military said 34 pkk militants had been killed in operations since sunday 's attack , which increased pressure on ankara for a military incursion into northern iraq , where the rebels take refuge .
last week , the turkish parliament authorized the government to order cross-border military strikes against the separatist camps .
turkey considers next move the new international appeals for restraint , and signs that baghdad might hand some rebels over to prevent a turkish military strike , prompted the national security council of top military officers and senior ministers , led by president abdullah gül , to meet and consider its next step .

babacan said iraq should hand over about 100 pkk members whose names figured on a list sent to baghdad earlier this year , added the source .
the issue will be taken up during talks in ankara on thursday with an iraqi security delegation .
babacan added that ankara would not flinch from military action if iraq and the united states did not clamp down on pkk bases in northern iraq .
turkey has long demanded that iraq prevent the pkk - which has been fighting for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1984 - from using its territory , cut off logistical support and hand over rebel leaders to turkey .

according to reports , turkish fighter jets bombed and destroyed several kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- mountain positions in sirnak , hakkari , siirt and van provinces , which are on the borders with iraq and iran , the semi-official anatolia news agency said .
the reports stated that helicopter gunships also took part in the raids that followed the killing of 12 soldiers in a pkk ambush near the iraqi border on sunday .
the pkk said it captured eight soldiers in the clashes .

babacan said iraq should hand over about 100 pkk members whose names figured on a list sent to baghdad earlier this year , added the source .
the issue will be taken up during talks in ankara on thursday with an iraqi security delegation .
babacan added that ankara would not flinch from military action if iraq and the united states did not clamp down on pkk bases in northern iraq .
turkey has long demanded that iraq prevent the pkk - which has been fighting for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1984 - from using its territory , cut off logistical support and hand over rebel leaders to turkey .

he also urged the rebels to adhere to their offer of a ceasefire conditional on turkey dropping its plans for an incursion into northern iraq .

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 24.10.2007 german politicians present plan for post-wwii expellee memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only part of anhalter station survived wwii bombings ; now it could be a memorial site german politicians have developed a concept for a controversial documentation center for wartime expulsions in berlin and will present it to the cabinet for approval by the end of the year . days after german chancellor angela merkel said she wanted a " visible symbol " in berlin to mark the fate of millions of people displaced after world war two , members of her government said they had come up with a concept for a controversial documentation center in berlin towards that purpose . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper quoted wolfgang thierse , vice president of the lower house of parliament , as saying there were plans for setting up an independent foundation under the aegis of the german historical museum in berlin .
it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , that he would circulate the concept of rotating forces in afghanistan 's more dangerous regions and intends to put the motion to member governments . nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer made the announcement before talks with allied defense ministers in the coastal town of noordwijk in the netherlands . " if you look at the necessity for political , military and financial solidarity in afghanistan , i do think that at a certain stage i would like to see more rotation in afghanistan , " he told reporters , according to afp news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.10.2007 french parliament passes controversial dna bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't touch my dna , " read the banners protesting the tests in paris the french parliament passed a new immigration bill tightening the conditions under which immigrants ' families may join them in france , including deeply controversial voluntary dna tests to verify family ties . the controversial measure , which critics say is racist and which sparked large street protests in paris last weekend , passed by 282 votes to 235 in the lower chamber of parliament , the national assembly , and by 185 votes to 136 in the upper chamber , the senate .
the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .
" this law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology , " said arnaud montebourg of the opposition socialists .
test used in 11 eu nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy ca n't understand why the issue has raised such a storm in france the dna testing technique , which is widely used on criminals , builds on sarkozy 's campaign promise to toughen immigration rules .
its supporters say it will help speed up the process for genuine applicants and they cite similar laws in other european countries .
" this dna test exists in 11 countries in europe - including some socialist ones , like great britain , " president sarkozy said in a recent television interview .

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .

" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .
" this law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology , " said arnaud montebourg of the opposition socialists .
test used in 11 eu nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy ca n't understand why the issue has raised such a storm in france the dna testing technique , which is widely used on criminals , builds on sarkozy 's campaign promise to toughen immigration rules .
its supporters say it will help speed up the process for genuine applicants and they cite similar laws in other european countries .
" this dna test exists in 11 countries in europe - including some socialist ones , like great britain , " president sarkozy said in a recent television interview .
" how is that it does n't pose a problem in these countries , but it creates a debate here ? " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .

what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .

how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .

we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .

sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .

for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .

it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "

it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , chinese goods worth 48.8 billion euros amounted to 6.7 percent of all products imported into germany .
only france and the netherlands exported more to germany in the same period .
until ten years ago , chinese exports made up just 2.6 percent of overall exports to germany , according to statistics .
chinese threads and toys popular german consumers ' appetite for all things made in china is especially evident in clothing , shoes , toys and electronic products , the figures showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china-made shoes make up 29 percent of textile imports last year , a fourth of all imported textiles came from china while leather goods such as shoes made up 29 percent .
notwithstanding the recent scares surrounding chinese-made toys , last year 60 percent of all toys and games imported into the country by german companies originated in chinese factories .
the same trend is underway in the high-tech electronics market , statisticians said .
since 1996 , gadgets made in china are increasingly popular in germany with television sets , radios and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics heading the list .
statisticians said computers made in china are also increasingly breaking into the german market .
it 's estimated that every third computer sold in germany is manufactured in china .
one-way street the flood of goods from china to germany seems however to be a one-way flow .
the asian country is also rated number 11 when it comes to importing german goods .
last year , germany exported products worth 27.5 billion euros to china .
however , the figures do n't include german cars , for instance , that are assembled in china . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .

24 , that he would circulate the concept of rotating forces in afghanistan 's more dangerous regions and intends to put the motion to member governments . nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer made the announcement before talks with allied defense ministers in the coastal town of noordwijk in the netherlands . " if you look at the necessity for political , military and financial solidarity in afghanistan , i do think that at a certain stage i would like to see more rotation in afghanistan , " he told reporters , according to afp news agency . " i 'll not table a rotation plan , i 'll mention it and i hope that me mentioning it and possibly ministers discussing this will have some impact , " he said ahead of talks with the ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai -lrb- r -rrb- with isaf troops in kabul later , at the start of talks , scheffer said : " our top priority today is afghanistan , where we are supporting the united nations ' efforts under a un mandate , " according to dpa . the united states has urged its european allies to provide more troops to fight taliban militants . isaf commanders want more troops currently , the us , british , canadian and dutch troops are bearing most of the burden of fighting militants in the volatile south and east of afghanistan . commanders with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- have asked for more combat troops and aircraft , particularly helicopters , to confront the taliban insurgency .
however , many allies - including germany - do not want to deploy soldiers to the most dangerous areas , like the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say afghan national army soldiers must be trained before an exit of western troops one nato official told afp that a rotation system would allow countries to plan their future troop movements more efficiently and would encourage allies to extend their stay in afghanistan .
should the plan be agreed upon , the official said it was unlikely that the plan would be initiated within a year . according to reuters news agency , us defense secretary robert gates accused allies on monday that they were not fulfilling their promises to supply troops , equipment and trainers for the national army in afghanistan . experts have said the training of the army is necessary before an exit strategy for western troops could be planned . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .

ahead of its reopening on oct .
24 , dw-world.de spoke with book restoration director matthias hageböck . dw-world.de : this was the worst library fire in postwar german history .
what was your initial reaction when you learned of the extent of the damage ? matthias hageböck : immediately after the fire , i was just happy that the building had n't completely burned down .
as it became clear just how many books had been damaged , my mood took a turn for the worse .
it was in the tens of thousands , and i thought , there 's no way we 'll be able to get this done within our lifetime .
it will be a task for several generations .
i feel a bit different now because i 've got an overview . the anna amalia library is a major historic institution , one where goethe himself used to work .
what sorts of material are you trying to save ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library 's team of restorers has preserved thousands of old volumes both the library building and its holdings are a unesco world cultural heritage site , and most of the books come from the period between 1750 to 1850 . every single book is significant insofar as goethe , schiller and other leading figures of the enlightenment used them .
that does n't mean that every individual book is extremely valuable .
but of course many of them are first editions and are worth a lot of money . many books were damaged by water used to put out the fire .
how can they be saved ? with water damaged books , we 're not interested in stains , which are merely aesthetic flaws .
we 're working mainly on the bindings .
that 's a big challenge .
with leather-bound books , for instance , the leather has contracted in the drying process .
there are tears in the material so the books ca n't even be opened , let alone read .
replacing these sorts of brittle , dry leather bindings is one of our main challenges . and how do you handle books that were actually burnt ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library is a unesco world heritage site first of all we divided them up into four different categories , depending on the extent of the damage .
we can only restore those in the " slightly damaged " category - they 're around 8,000 in number .
here we 're not working on the bindings , but rather the paper itself .
there are three basic methods of paper restoration .
the most drastic is to split the page , insert some stable , replacement paper in between the damaged halves and then glue them back together .
an alternative is to cover the surface of the page with an ultra-thin , transparent layer of paper .
and then there 's the option of applying additional paper fibers on burn spots on pages . this is a very expensive process .
does it make sense to restore books physically in the digital age ? there are some things that you can only see in the book itself .
the information within the text , of course , can be digitalized , but other things ca n't - for instance , markings within books .
they can tell you a lot about the history of a book , such as where , when , and often by whom it was bound .
sometimes , you can tell who the owners were , for instance , when a priest has made notes for his sermons in the margins .
these are things that ca n't be digitalized .
you can only discover them in the original volume .
and you can learn things from examining the material .
for example , an australian colleague of mine was examining the log books of the 18th-century captain william bligh from the hms bounty .
he discovered that the sand used to dry the handwriting on the page from the day of the mutiny came from england , and not hawaii .
and the watermark on the paper was different .
that meant that bligh had replaced the page later on - probably to offer a milder account of the events so the officers concerned could continue their careers .
those are all things that ca n't be digitalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias hageböck how much restoration work do you have left to do ? we aim to repair the entire damage from the fire by the year 2015 - that 's 20,000 water-damaged and 8,000 fire-damaged volumes .
but we can only succeed if we have enough money , and the sums that have been donated thus far wo n't be sufficient .
so we 'll be dependent in future as well on people 's generosity . what are your feelings ahead of the reopening ceremony ? of course , they 're very positive .
in the run-up to the reopening , there 's been a lot of stress , which has distracted us somewhat from how happy we are .

last year , chinese goods worth 48.8 billion euros amounted to 6.7 percent of all products imported into germany .
only france and the netherlands exported more to germany in the same period .
until ten years ago , chinese exports made up just 2.6 percent of overall exports to germany , according to statistics .
chinese threads and toys popular german consumers ' appetite for all things made in china is especially evident in clothing , shoes , toys and electronic products , the figures showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china-made shoes make up 29 percent of textile imports last year , a fourth of all imported textiles came from china while leather goods such as shoes made up 29 percent .
notwithstanding the recent scares surrounding chinese-made toys , last year 60 percent of all toys and games imported into the country by german companies originated in chinese factories .
the same trend is underway in the high-tech electronics market , statisticians said .
since 1996 , gadgets made in china are increasingly popular in germany with television sets , radios and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics heading the list .
statisticians said computers made in china are also increasingly breaking into the german market .
it 's estimated that every third computer sold in germany is manufactured in china .
one-way street the flood of goods from china to germany seems however to be a one-way flow .
the asian country is also rated number 11 when it comes to importing german goods .
last year , germany exported products worth 27.5 billion euros to china .
however , the figures do n't include german cars , for instance , that are assembled in china . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .
" this law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology , " said arnaud montebourg of the opposition socialists .
test used in 11 eu nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy ca n't understand why the issue has raised such a storm in france the dna testing technique , which is widely used on criminals , builds on sarkozy 's campaign promise to toughen immigration rules .
its supporters say it will help speed up the process for genuine applicants and they cite similar laws in other european countries .
" this dna test exists in 11 countries in europe - including some socialist ones , like great britain , " president sarkozy said in a recent television interview .
" how is that it does n't pose a problem in these countries , but it creates a debate here ? " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what were they thinking about and how could they let that catastrophe happen ? " ' " or will they ask another question .

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .

however , many allies - including germany - do not want to deploy soldiers to the most dangerous areas , like the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say afghan national army soldiers must be trained before an exit of western troops one nato official told afp that a rotation system would allow countries to plan their future troop movements more efficiently and would encourage allies to extend their stay in afghanistan .

last year , chinese goods worth 48.8 billion euros amounted to 6.7 percent of all products imported into germany .
only france and the netherlands exported more to germany in the same period .
until ten years ago , chinese exports made up just 2.6 percent of overall exports to germany , according to statistics .
chinese threads and toys popular german consumers ' appetite for all things made in china is especially evident in clothing , shoes , toys and electronic products , the figures showed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china-made shoes make up 29 percent of textile imports last year , a fourth of all imported textiles came from china while leather goods such as shoes made up 29 percent .
notwithstanding the recent scares surrounding chinese-made toys , last year 60 percent of all toys and games imported into the country by german companies originated in chinese factories .
the same trend is underway in the high-tech electronics market , statisticians said .
since 1996 , gadgets made in china are increasingly popular in germany with television sets , radios and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics heading the list .
statisticians said computers made in china are also increasingly breaking into the german market .
it 's estimated that every third computer sold in germany is manufactured in china .
one-way street the flood of goods from china to germany seems however to be a one-way flow .
the asian country is also rated number 11 when it comes to importing german goods .
last year , germany exported products worth 27.5 billion euros to china .

it would be financed by the federal government which has already earmarked 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the project for 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierse says his plan eschews the league of expellees ...
the newspaper said the center would include an historical exhibition , seminar rooms and an " artistic memorial element . "
it may be housed in the deutsches haus at berlin 's anhalter train station , the standing remains of a former railway terminus near potsdamer platz . it 's estimated that some 15 million ethnic germans were pushed out of their homes in eastern europe in 1945 by the polish and czech governments as retribution for nazi aggression .
up to 2 million are thought to have died as a result of the expulsions .
" a visible symbol " germany 's current coalition government headed by merkel had made the creation of a " visible symbol " of the history of wartime expulsions a part of their coalition agreement when the government was formed , in 2005 .
according to the agreement , the center is meant to promote reconciliation and remind visitors of the injustice of expulsions and displacement worldwide . speaking this week on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , chancellor merkel said remembering the suffering of expellees is a " part of our german identity and a part of our culture of remembrance . " but the creation of the center remains highly controversial and has created tensions between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic . both warsaw and prague have opposed the location of such a center in berlin amid fears that some germans would like to revise history and see themselves predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
the two countries say the issue of expulsions should be highlighted in a joint european project . seemingly in an effort to assuage those fears , merkel said she was confident her government could find an appropriate and dignified way to create the center , also by conducting a dialogue with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
sticking point : role of league of expellees another sticking point in the long-discussed project has been the role of the controversial league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which first developed the plan for a memorial seven years ago .
the bdv lobbies for compensation for ethnic germans and their descendents who were displaced in the aftermath of world war ii .
the group and its president , erika steinbach , is regarded with intense suspicion in poland and the czech republic , where governments are wary of legal claims to restore property .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but league president steinbach says they will be involved the role of the bdv in the creation and organization of the planned center remains unclear . according to the newspaper report , the social democratic minority in the government would only agree to the project 's creation if erika steinbach did not take a leading role in the conception and creation of the memorial .
while thierse , a social democrat , said the league of german expellees would not be involved in the project , steinbach herself disputed the fact , saying that ethnic german expellees would be represented in the most important committees of the documentation center . this week , steinbach said the documentation center in berlin was long overdue 60 years after the end of the war .
but she also said the center should " paint a complete and true german and european picture of history . "
steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinbach added she welcomed the notion of berlin 's anhalter train station as a home for the memorial . the anhalter station has an emotional connection to the whole topic of expulsion , and the standing fragment of the building 's facade is " practically a symbol for arrival and displacement , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the immigration bill originally included an amendment that would have imposed compulsory genetic testing to verify the bloodlines of would-be immigrants who want to join family members already living in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french actress isabelle adjani joined protests against the genetic testing the amendment was watered down to make the dna tests voluntary following an uproar among politicians -lrb- even within president sarkozy 's ruling ump party -rrb- , intellectuals and immigrant groups that the tests were discriminatory and ran contrary to france 's humanitarian values and principles . the tests , which will be introduced for an 18-month trial period , will now be based on the mother to avoid paternity disputes , and they will be paid for by the state rather than by immigrants themselves .
they are meant to be carried out in cases where family records in the immigrant 's home country are generally unreliable .
" a day of shame " the tests still remain deeply controversial , with critics attacking them as racist and for stirring up memories of the ugliest period of modern french history .
" this day will remain a day of shame , " the rights group the movement against racism and for friendship between people , or mrap , said in a statement after the measure was passed .
the group compared the dna tests to anti-jewish discrimination under the vichy government , which collaborated with nazi germany .
" it will be the second time in france that biology will dictate the law for racist discriminatory aims , " mrap said .
the measure has triggered unease because it challenges the notion of family in french law based on recognition of a child as one 's own , not on blood .
" this law violates the fundamental principles of the republic which do not define family and affiliation by biology , " said arnaud montebourg of the opposition socialists .
test used in 11 eu nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy ca n't understand why the issue has raised such a storm in france the dna testing technique , which is widely used on criminals , builds on sarkozy 's campaign promise to toughen immigration rules .

" this dna test exists in 11 countries in europe - including some socialist ones , like great britain , " president sarkozy said in a recent television interview .

" turkey should think twice before launching a military intervention , " manuel lobo antunes , the european affairs minister of portugal , which currently holds the eu presidency , told the european parliament in strasbourg .
" it 's important that the international community supports turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism , in respect of the law , without risking the stability of the region and the whole continent , " antunes added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called on ankara and baghdad to work in cooperation and in accordance with international law when dealing with the attacks on turkish troops by iraqi kurdish rebels .
the european union " condemns all terrorist attacks and understands turkey 's need to protect its citizens , " rehn told the same session of the european parliament .
" but we also urge turkey to seek a political solution in cooperation with iraq , regional authorities and the international community and to show a sense of proportionality in its response to pkk terrorism . "
the eu was joined by the united states in calling for diplomatic efforts to replace military action .

babacan said iraq should hand over about 100 pkk members whose names figured on a list sent to baghdad earlier this year , added the source .
the issue will be taken up during talks in ankara on thursday with an iraqi security delegation .
babacan added that ankara would not flinch from military action if iraq and the united states did not clamp down on pkk bases in northern iraq .
turkey has long demanded that iraq prevent the pkk - which has been fighting for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1984 - from using its territory , cut off logistical support and hand over rebel leaders to turkey .

the pain-relieving qualities of cannabis have long been hailed , and several countries have made it available for medicinal purposes .
but quantity is key , according to the study in the journal anesthesiology .
university of california researchers found moderate use had the greatest impact on pain in 15 volunteers , while large doses actually made pain worse .
the team recruited 15 healthy volunteers , in whom pain was induced by injecting capsaicin - the " hot " chemical found in chilli peppers - under their skin .
they were then given cannabis to smoke .
the strength of the dose was determined by the tetrahydrocannabinol content , which is the main active chemical in cannabis .
some of the volunteers were given a placebo .
high , but in pain five minutes after smoking the drug , none of the doses had any effect on the pain felt .
but 45 minutes later , those who had smoked the moderate dose said their pain was much better , while those who consumed high doses said it had got worse .
they did , however , feel " higher " than counterparts who had taken moderate doses .
dr mark wallace , the lead researcher , said the findings could have implications for the way medicinal cannabis was offered , both in pure and drug form .
some experts are concerned that results on healthy volunteers could not be translated into how cannabis works in the bodies of those with cancer or multiple sclerosis , for whom the drug is increasingly seen as a potential form of pain relief .
dr laura bell , of the ms society , said : " many people with ms report benefits to symptoms such as pain from taking cannabis , however studies to date on the effects of cannabis on pain are small and difficult to draw firm conclusions from .
" we would be interested to see the results from larger scale studies focused on people with ms. "

the pain-relieving qualities of cannabis have long been hailed , and several countries have made it available for medicinal purposes .
but quantity is key , according to the study in the journal anesthesiology .
university of california researchers found moderate use had the greatest impact on pain in 15 volunteers , while large doses actually made pain worse .
the team recruited 15 healthy volunteers , in whom pain was induced by injecting capsaicin - the " hot " chemical found in chilli peppers - under their skin .
they were then given cannabis to smoke .
the strength of the dose was determined by the tetrahydrocannabinol content , which is the main active chemical in cannabis .
some of the volunteers were given a placebo .
high , but in pain five minutes after smoking the drug , none of the doses had any effect on the pain felt .
but 45 minutes later , those who had smoked the moderate dose said their pain was much better , while those who consumed high doses said it had got worse .
they did , however , feel " higher " than counterparts who had taken moderate doses .
dr mark wallace , the lead researcher , said the findings could have implications for the way medicinal cannabis was offered , both in pure and drug form .
some experts are concerned that results on healthy volunteers could not be translated into how cannabis works in the bodies of those with cancer or multiple sclerosis , for whom the drug is increasingly seen as a potential form of pain relief .
dr laura bell , of the ms society , said : " many people with ms report benefits to symptoms such as pain from taking cannabis , however studies to date on the effects of cannabis on pain are small and difficult to draw firm conclusions from .
" we would be interested to see the results from larger scale studies focused on people with ms. "

it follows a review by an independent panel ordered after an incident last month involving the us firm blackwater , in which some 17 iraqi civilians died .
the steps include tightening the state department 's rules of engagement so they are in line with the military 's .
contractors will also have to undergo improved cultural awareness training .
there will also be better co-ordination with the us military and tighter restrictions on the use of force .
boards will be set up to investigate any future killings involving private contractors in iraq , and they will have the power to refer cases to the us justice department .
contractors will also have to have arabic speakers on hand .
' strained relations ' ms rice , who was briefed on the report on monday " has decided to move ahead with the recommendations that are within her purview to act on immediately " , state department official patrick kennedy said .
mr kennedy , who led the review panel , said its recommendations would clarify the rules of engagement for private contractors .
the panel has emphasised that they should open fire only with " due regard for the safety of innocent bystanders " .
however , its recommendations focus on management and policy relating to security contractors rather than any possible wrongdoing by blackwater or others , mr kennedy told reporters .
" prompt measures should be taken to strengthen the co-ordination , oversight and accountability aspects of the state department 's security practices in iraq in order to reduce the likelihood that future incidents will occur , " the report said .
' strained relations state department spokesman sean mccormack said earlier that some of the review panel 's recommendations would require co-ordination with the pentagon .
ms rice is expected to meet defence secretary robert gates later this week to discuss those changes .
earlier this month , ms rice ordered that a member of the state department 's own security staff accompany all blackwater-escorted diplomatic convoys and that video cameras be installed in the firm 's security vehicles .
the blackwater incident in baghdad strained relations with iraq and forced the state department to act , the bbc 's jonathan beale in washington says .
an iraqi government investigation concluded that blackwater guards fired on civilians without provocation .
iraqi leaders have demanded that the us government end its association with blackwater in iraq within six months and hand over the contractors involved in the 16 september incident .
blackwater 's chairman , erik prince , has insisted he has proof that the firm 's guards were fired upon and has defended its record before the us congress .
us officials have released few details of the incident , as it is subject to an investigation by the fbi .

it follows a review by an independent panel ordered after an incident last month involving the us firm blackwater , in which some 17 iraqi civilians died .
the steps include tightening the state department 's rules of engagement so they are in line with the military 's .
contractors will also have to undergo improved cultural awareness training .
there will also be better co-ordination with the us military and tighter restrictions on the use of force .
boards will be set up to investigate any future killings involving private contractors in iraq , and they will have the power to refer cases to the us justice department .
contractors will also have to have arabic speakers on hand .
' strained relations ' ms rice , who was briefed on the report on monday " has decided to move ahead with the recommendations that are within her purview to act on immediately " , state department official patrick kennedy said .
ms rice wants to improve the accountability of contractors mr kennedy , who led the review panel , said its recommendations would clarify the rules of engagement for private contractors .
the panel has emphasised that they should open fire only with " due regard for the safety of innocent bystanders " .
however , its recommendations focus on management and policy relating to security contractors rather than any possible wrongdoing by blackwater or others , mr kennedy told reporters .
" prompt measures should be taken to strengthen the co-ordination , oversight and accountability aspects of the state department 's security practices in iraq in order to reduce the likelihood that future incidents will occur , " the report said .
' strained relations state department spokesman sean mccormack said earlier that some of the review panel 's recommendations would require co-ordination with the pentagon .
ms rice is expected to meet defence secretary robert gates later this week to discuss those changes .
earlier this month , ms rice ordered that a member of the state department 's own security staff accompany all blackwater-escorted diplomatic convoys and that video cameras be installed in the firm 's security vehicles .
the blackwater incident in baghdad strained relations with iraq and forced the state department to act , the bbc 's jonathan beale in washington says .
an iraqi government investigation concluded that blackwater guards fired on civilians without provocation .
iraqi leaders have demanded that the us government end its association with blackwater in iraq within six months and hand over the contractors involved in the 16 september incident .
blackwater 's chairman , erik prince , has insisted he has proof that the firm 's guards were fired upon and has defended its record before the us congress .
us officials have released few details of the incident , as it is subject to an investigation by the fbi .

the delegation 's week-long visit consolidates links with hay-on-wye in powys after they chose the book town as their twin six months ago .
last year there was an appeal in a national newspaper to find the city an international community partner .
the official twinning ceremony will take place in hay-on-wye on thursday .
welcoming the delegation from timbuktu , rhodri morgan said the twinning was " yet another proof that wales has not become inward looking and self-obsessed since devolution started in 1999 " .
mr morgan added : " welsh people are renowned for their internationalist outlook and their desire to help those elsewhere in the world less fortunate than us living in wales and this new , international partnership is a great example of what we are trying to achieve through the wales for africa framework . "
" it 's been a long , exciting and magical journey " sue newall , hay2timbuktu delegation committee sue newall , chair of the hay2timbuktu delegation committee , who is set up to oversee the twinning initiative said everyone involved was very " excited " about the project .
" the main event will take place on thursday at 1830 , when crowds will gather to witness the signing of the twinning document in the market square .
" local schoolchildren have been busy rehearsing the malian and welsh national anthems , which they will sing as the two mayors sign the twinning document to officially seal the relationship , " she added .
the town fought off 52 other challengers in february and anne brichto , driving force behind the twinning , describes it as " a modern partnership between two ancient cultures " .
" it 's been a long , exciting and magical journey , " she added .
westminster reception during its stay , the team from west africa will promote links between schools and help people learn more about mali and timbuktu , which is on the southern tip of the sahara .
it is hoped the initial visit will allow for exploratory discussions about future projects in the areas of education , health , art and music .
delegates , including the mayor of timbuktu , said ould mahmoud , have already visited hay- on-wye primary school and gwernyfed high school in brecon .
they also attended a reception at westminster with roger williams , mp for brecon and radnorshire , on monday .
on wednesday , they will visit the welsh assembly in cardiff and meet mr morgan and education minister jane hutt before travelling to the big pit in blaenavon .
timbuktu - also spelt as tombouctou - is already twinned with a chemnitz in germany , saintes in france , marrakech in morocco , kairouan in tunisia , and tempe in the us .
a return visit to timbuktu is planned for spring 2008 .

organisers claimed restrictions imposed over the foot-and-mouth outbreak in surrey could have cost the sheep farming industry in wales up to £ 150m .
a delegation is to meet rural affairs minister elin jones to discuss the issues raised at the meeting .
ms jones has already said the costs of foot-and-mouth should be met by defra and the uk treasury .
national farmers ' union cymru president dai davies said the assembly government does not have the money to help farmers recovering from the effects of the disease outbreak .
" all praise to them , they have been scrabbling around from outside the agricultural budget to get £ 6m of £ 7m , " he said .
meat exports from wales were hit by the foot-and-mouth outbreak " but £ 6 or £ 7m is virtually peanuts when you look at the situation in wales and the hardships that the farmers are facing at the moment . "
rob davies , a farmer in the brecon beacons , organised the meeting in builth wells .
" it 's reached crisis point and we do n't seem to be getting any answers , mainly from westminster , " he said .
" the welsh assembly government have done all they can to keep foot-and-mouth out of wales . "
mr davies said they estimated the cost of the outbreak to the uk over the autumn was £ 520m , and up to £ 150m for the sheep industry in wales alone .
the welsh assembly government has said it has helped with £ 6.75m to cover the costs of the welfare slaughter of light lambs that can not be sent over to europe and £ 1m to market welsh meat .
but the farmers were expected to call for emergency aid , a hold on lamb imports and also for more supermarkets to follow the example of waitrose 's pledges on lamb prices over the winter .
pembrokeshire farmer brian thomas said before the meeting : " the biggest help would be coming from supermarkets .
' weakness ' " we 've had waitrose pledge they are prepared to pay £ 2.40 a kilo live weight to farmers over the winter , and that 's approximately £ 12 more a lamb than we 're having at the moment .
" if we could get that commitment from other supermarkets , it would relieve the problem a fair bit . "
meanwhile , the uk environment secretary has apologised to farmers for the uk government 's role in allowing foot-and-mouth disease to escape from a high-security laboratory .
hilary benn 's department has been accused by mps of " a lamentable piece of neglect " in allowing the virus to escape from an animal research site in surrey this summer .
mr benn told the commons rural affairs committee that it was a " weakness in the system " that he greatly regretted .
official reports found that the first foot-and-mouth outbreak in august originated in the pirbright laboratory site in surrey - a uk government facility .

" all praise to them , they have been scrabbling around from outside the agricultural budget to get £ 6m of £ 7m , " he said .
meat exports from wales were hit by the foot-and-mouth outbreak " but £ 6 or £ 7m is virtually peanuts when you look at the situation in wales and the hardships that the farmers are facing at the moment . "
rob davies , a farmer in the brecon beacons , organised the meeting in builth wells .
" it 's reached crisis point and we do n't seem to be getting any answers , mainly from westminster , " he said .
" the welsh assembly government have done all they can to keep foot-and-mouth out of wales . "
mr davies said they estimated the cost of the outbreak to the uk over the autumn was £ 520m , and up to £ 150m for the sheep industry in wales alone .
the welsh assembly government has said it has helped with £ 6.75m to cover the costs of the welfare slaughter of light lambs that can not be sent over to europe and £ 1m to market welsh meat .
but the farmers were expected to call for emergency aid , a hold on lamb imports and also for more supermarkets to follow the example of waitrose 's pledges on lamb prices over the winter .
pembrokeshire farmer brian thomas said before the meeting : " the biggest help would be coming from supermarkets .
' weakness ' " we 've had waitrose pledge they are prepared to pay £ 2.40 a kilo live weight to farmers over the winter , and that 's approximately £ 12 more a lamb than we 're having at the moment .
" if we could get that commitment from other supermarkets , it would relieve the problem a fair bit . "
meanwhile , the uk environment secretary has apologised to farmers for the uk government 's role in allowing foot-and-mouth disease to escape from a high-security laboratory .
hilary benn 's department has been accused by mps of " a lamentable piece of neglect " in allowing the virus to escape from an animal research site in surrey this summer .
mr benn told the commons rural affairs committee that it was a " weakness in the system " that he greatly regretted .
official reports found that the first foot-and-mouth outbreak in august originated in the pirbright laboratory site in surrey - a uk government facility .

however , s & n reacted angrily to the bid plans last week , calling them " unsolicited and unwelcome " .
on tuesday , the brewer launched a counter offensive over the bbh business .

" the board is still evaluating whether the best interests of s & n shareholders will ultimately be served by outright ownership of bbh or through the introduction of a new partner -lrb- s -rrb- into bbh . "
the firm added that it had been " content " with the joint ownership of bbh , and had wanted it to continue " for the long-term " .
" however , given the breaches of the agreement by carlsberg and their serious implications for bbh , the board of s & n has felt compelled to respond swiftly to protect its position , " s & n said .

on tuesday , s & n said that carlsberg had breached terms of the agreement for the jointly-owned russian beer business , baltic beverages holding -lrb- bbh -rrb- .
the move comes after carlsberg and heineken said last week that they were considering a joint bid for s & n. s & n said it was now considering whether to take full control of bbh .
the edinburgh-based s & n also said it might seek a new partner for bbh , which is seen as one of s & n 's most-prized assets .
swift reaction last week , carlsberg and heineken announced that they were in talks about forming a consortium to buy s & n , the largest uk-owned brewing company whose brands include foster 's , kronenbourg 1664 and newcastle brown ale .
s & n brands kronenbourg fosters strongbow newcastle brown ale john smith 's see s & n 's share price if carlsberg and heineken do make a bid , their plan is to split s & n between them .
heineken would take control of s & n 's main business in the uk and some other european markets , while carlsberg would take over s & n 's operations in france and greece , and gain full control of bbh .
however , s & n reacted angrily to the bid plans last week , calling them " unsolicited and unwelcome " .
on tuesday , the brewer launched a counter offensive over the bbh business .
in a statement , s & n said : " the board believes that the actions of carlsberg constitute initiation of the voluntary termination provisions of the agreement under which carlsberg is obliged to offer its shares in bbh to s & n.
" the board is still evaluating whether the best interests of s & n shareholders will ultimately be served by outright ownership of bbh or through the introduction of a new partner -lrb- s -rrb- into bbh . "
the firm added that it had been " content " with the joint ownership of bbh , and had wanted it to continue " for the long-term " .
" however , given the breaches of the agreement by carlsberg and their serious implications for bbh , the board of s & n has felt compelled to respond swiftly to protect its position , " s & n said .
however , in a short statement , carlsberg replied that it believed " the claims made have no merit " .

with several of the latter appearing in more than one title , though , awards bodies are facing a number of potential headaches .
for example , should they recognise australian actress cate blanchett for her royal role in the golden age , which sees her reprise her oscar-nominated portrayal in 1998 's elizabeth ?
or should they follow the jury at the venice film festival , which chose to reward her uncanny impression of musician bob dylan in experimental biopic i 'm not there ?
somewhat controversially , the venice judges also recognised brad pitt for his work in the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford .
some critics , however , believe co-star casey affleck - who plays ford to pitt 's james - gives the better performance in this rather ponderous dissection of western lore .
grieving father will they go head-to-head for the best actor oscar ?
or will affleck be relegated to the best supporting actor category ?
then again , it is entirely possible casey will be recognised for gone baby gone , a missing child drama that marks his older brother ben 's directorial debut .
if so , he and pitt could find themselves competing against each other for the coveted best actor gong .
having won a best supporting actor oscar last year for syriana , george clooney could also be up for that prize for playing a conflicted lawyer in michael clayton .
tommy lee jones must be considered a contender too for playing a grieving father in iraq war drama in the valley of elah .
jones might be up for a supporting actor nomination as well for his ageing sheriff role in the coen brothers ' well-regarded thriller , no country for old men .
among the best actress hopefuls , veteran british actress julie christie is generating a lot of buzz for her moving turn as an alzheimer 's sufferer in away from her .
so is french actress marion cotillard for her epic performance as edith piaf in la vie en rose , while meryl streep could land yet another nomination - her 15th - for lions for lambs .
robert redford 's political thriller could figure among the best picture candidates , as might into the wild - a survivalist drama from fellow actor-turned-director sean penn .
british contenders penn 's film - based on the true story of a young man who went to live alone in the alaskan wilderness - should land the oscar-winning actor his first nomination as a director .
veteran performer hal holbrook , meanwhile , is sure to be in line for a supporting actor nod for his affecting turn in the same film as an elderly widower .
british contenders , besides christie , may include atonement 's james mcavoy , tom wilkinson for michael clayton and sacha baron cohen for his supporting role in sweeney todd .
hairspray , another musical , could easily land considerations for michelle pfeiffer , christopher walken and john travolta .
in a strong year for male performances , denzel washington and russell crowe could both be shortlisted for ridley scott 's fact-based crime yarn american gangster .
and one should not rule out their fellow oscar recipients tom hanks , julia roberts and philip seymour hoffman , all of whom appear in topical drama charlie wilson 's war .
with plenty of big films still unseen , though - notably the golden compass , based on the first novel in philip pullman 's his dark materials trilogy - there is still all to play for at this early stage .

will cate blanchett be recognised for playing elizabeth i or bob dylan ?
with several of the latter appearing in more than one title , though , awards bodies are facing a number of potential headaches .
for example , should they recognise australian actress cate blanchett for her royal role in the golden age , which sees her reprise her oscar-nominated portrayal in 1998 's elizabeth ?
or should they follow the jury at the venice film festival , which chose to reward her uncanny impression of musician bob dylan in experimental biopic i 'm not there ?
somewhat controversially , the venice judges also recognised brad pitt for his work in the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford .
some critics , however , believe co-star casey affleck - who plays ford to pitt 's james - gives the better performance in this rather ponderous dissection of western lore .
grieving father will they go head-to-head for the best actor oscar ?
or will affleck be relegated to the best supporting actor category ?
then again , it is entirely possible casey will be recognised for gone baby gone , a missing child drama that marks his older brother ben 's directorial debut .
affleck -lrb- l -rrb- and pitt -lrb- r -rrb- star in the assassination of jesse james ...
if so , he and pitt could find themselves competing against each other for the coveted best actor gong .
having won a best supporting actor oscar last year for syriana , george clooney could also be up for that prize for playing a conflicted lawyer in michael clayton .
tommy lee jones must be considered a contender too for playing a grieving father in iraq war drama in the valley of elah .
jones might be up for a supporting actor nomination as well for his ageing sheriff role in the coen brothers ' well-regarded thriller , no country for old men .
among the best actress hopefuls , veteran british actress julie christie is generating a lot of buzz for her moving turn as an alzheimer 's sufferer in away from her .
so is french actress marion cotillard for her epic performance as edith piaf in la vie en rose , while meryl streep could land yet another nomination - her 15th - for lions for lambs .
robert redford 's political thriller could figure among the best picture candidates , as might into the wild - a survivalist drama from fellow actor-turned-director sean penn .
british contenders penn 's film - based on the true story of a young man who went to live alone in the alaskan wilderness - should land the oscar-winning actor his first nomination as a director .
veteran performer hal holbrook , meanwhile , is sure to be in line for a supporting actor nod for his affecting turn in the same film as an elderly widower .
could previous oscar-winner jones be nominated for different films ?
british contenders , besides christie , may include atonement 's james mcavoy , tom wilkinson for michael clayton and sacha baron cohen for his supporting role in sweeney todd .
hairspray , another musical , could easily land considerations for michelle pfeiffer , christopher walken and john travolta .
in a strong year for male performances , denzel washington and russell crowe could both be shortlisted for ridley scott 's fact-based crime yarn american gangster .
and one should not rule out their fellow oscar recipients tom hanks , julia roberts and philip seymour hoffman , all of whom appear in topical drama charlie wilson 's war .

sony 's playstation game resistance : fall of man , uses the historic church as a backdrop to a violent gunfight .
the game was nominated , but failed , to win an award at the british academy video games awards on tuesday evening .
the company has apologised for using the graphics , but said it would not be withdrawing the game from sale .
the awards , organised by the british academy of film and television arts -lrb- bafta -rrb- , took place at battersea evolution , in battersea park , london .
after it was announced that the game had not won an award , the dean of manchester cathedral , the very reverend rogers govender said : " i think some important lessons have been learnt .
" so we do forgive sony for what they have done , even though they still believe they have done nothing wrong .
" in an industry that is breaking new frontiers , it is important that long held traditions of film and television are maintained .
" these traditions include having courtesy , respecting the dignity of your subject , and admitting when mistakes have been made .
" in so many ways sony have failed to live up to these standards by disrespecting people of faith and the victims of gun crime here in manchester . "
he said however due to the row over the video game the cathedral had seen an increase in visits from young people and tourists .

mr sweeney , a dup member , said both men lobbied on his behalf on plans for a visitors ' centre at giant 's causeway because they believed in the project .
mr sweeney said he has never met dup environment minister arlene foster .
he was speaking to the bbc 's spotlight for the first time publicly about his controversial bid to build a visitors ' centre at the landmark .
mrs foster has said she may approve his plans , but she said it was " rubbish " to suggest she was influenced by mr sweeney 's membership of the dup .
mr sweeney said he had " nothing to hide " about his links to the party .
he held a news conference in belfast on tuesday .
mr sweeney said he wanted to hold the press conference to put forward his side of the story .
giant 's causeway is a popular tourist attraction " we came out and made statements when the minister first announced her minded intention , " he said .
" we felt that with those disclosures - in terms of people buying houses from us , or memberships of various parties - that being open and honest would have drawn a line under the matter .
" that has patently and clearly not happened and has ... besmirched , in my view , the actual merits of the planning application . "
mr sweeney admitted he used mr paisley snr 's name on a lottery fund application without asking him .
but he was also adamant that he had never said his project had been given approval by unesco , a claim made by mr paisley snr .
he said that if his centre was given the go ahead immediately it would be at least 2010 before it would be up and running .
in tuesday 's spotlight , mr sweeney said : " at no stage have i discussed this proposal with anybody other than the paisleys -lrb- dup leader ian paisley and his son ian jr -rrb- and local dup councillors , " he said .
" i have not spoken to -lrb- dup tourism minister -rrb- nigel dodds or arlene foster - if they came into this room now , i would be meeting them for the first time . "
the causeway attracts nearly 500,000 visitors a year , but the previous visitors ' centre burned down in 2000 .
in september , mrs foster said she knew nothing about mr sweeney 's background but his application to build a new facility had " considerable merit " .
" a minister , when making decisions , can not and should not investigate party affiliations of applicants , and i did not do so in this case , " she said .

mr sweeney , a dup member , said both men lobbied on his behalf on plans for a visitors ' centre at giant 's causeway because they believed in the project .
mr sweeney said he has never met dup environment minister arlene foster .
he was speaking to the bbc 's spotlight for the first time publicly about his controversial bid to build a visitors ' centre at the landmark .
mrs foster has said she may approve his plans , but she said it was " rubbish " to suggest she was influenced by mr sweeney 's membership of the dup .
mr sweeney said he had " nothing to hide " about his links to the party .
he held a news conference in belfast on tuesday .
mr sweeney said he wanted to hold the press conference to put forward his side of the story .
giant 's causeway is a popular tourist attraction " we came out and made statements when the minister first announced her minded intention , " he said .
" we felt that with those disclosures - in terms of people buying houses from us , or memberships of various parties - that being open and honest would have drawn a line under the matter .
" that has patently and clearly not happened and has ... besmirched , in my view , the actual merits of the planning application . "
mr sweeney admitted he used mr paisley snr 's name on a lottery fund application without asking him .
but he was also adamant that he had never said his project had been given approval by unesco , a claim made by mr paisley snr .
he said that if his centre was given the go ahead immediately it would be at least 2010 before it would be up and running .
in tuesday 's spotlight , mr sweeney said : " at no stage have i discussed this proposal with anybody other than the paisleys -lrb- dup leader ian paisley and his son ian jr -rrb- and local dup councillors , " he said .
" i have not spoken to -lrb- dup tourism minister -rrb- nigel dodds or arlene foster - if they came into this room now , i would be meeting them for the first time . "
the causeway attracts nearly 500,000 visitors a year , but the previous visitors ' centre burned down in 2000 .
in september , mrs foster said she knew nothing about mr sweeney 's background but his application to build a new facility had " considerable merit " .
" a minister , when making decisions , can not and should not investigate party affiliations of applicants , and i did not do so in this case , " she said .
