however , it still needs approval from italy 's central bank and antitrust authorities . in a jointly released statement , the banks said they hoped to complete this process by the start of october . conditions have been ripe for consolidation of italian banks since bank of italy governor mario draghi last year threw out rules requiring banks to notify the government in advance of mergers .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians want to reconsider the bundeswehr 's two mandates in afghanistan " if there is not a radical change in the overall strategy , we are in danger of failing in afghanistan , " he added .
" other than the fact that there have been elections , none of the major goals has been reached . " while saying the army 's mandate needed to be looked at again , gertz , however , did not call for the withdrawal of german troops out of afghanistan . ´ the german parliament is scheduled to vote on a whether to extend the army 's mandate in the autumn .
some politicians have called for changes in the pair of mandates under which the bundeswehr is deployed in afghanistan after the weekend 's attack . " the discussion about this was tough enough already in the spd , " rolf muetzenich , a foreign policy expert in the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
" a terrible attack like this will obviously have an influence when it comes to deciding on whether to extend the mandate . " staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casulties in afghanistan are on the rise the social democrats share power with angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
members of both parties said they will not pull out of afghanistan because of the attacks . " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it , " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the spd told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . " german defense minister franz josef jung also said the attack would not alter germany 's peacekeeping obligations in afghanistan . " nothing will change with the mission , " he said in a television interview . the welt am sonntag newspaper applauded the resolve , saying in an editorial that any other decision would " send out the wrong signal to terrorists worldwide , to germany 's allies in nato and to the international community . " new strategy needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine of the left party wants troops pulled out of the country while conservative politicians stand firmly behind the military involvement , many germans disapprove of the military playing an active role abroad .
left-wing politicians renewed calls for a different strategy . greens party head reinhard bütikofer called for the german government to shift its focus to rebuilding the civilian infrastructures in afghanistan . " we 've been of the opinion for some time that we must change the overall strategy , " bütikofer said in a television interview monday .
oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .
lafontaine went a step further , accusing the german bundeswehr of engaging in terrorism activities in afghanistan .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to move troops into the south .
defense minister jung called lafontaine 's comment " absurd . " civilians casualties increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently sent fighter planes to afghanistan yet there are signs that jung is growing increasingly concerned about the situation there .
over the past month , afghan officials reported 50 civilians killed in us air strikes in fighting in the western province in herat , and another 21 in south central helmand province .
last monday , jung said he had complained to nato about the increasing civilian casualties . " we must ensure that operations do not develop this way .
it would not be a victory to set the -lrb- afghan -rrb- people against us , " jung said , after talks between eu defense ministers in brussels .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , largely in the north of the country .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians want to reconsider the bundeswehr 's two mandates in afghanistan " if there is not a radical change in the overall strategy , we are in danger of failing in afghanistan , " he added .
" other than the fact that there have been elections , none of the major goals has been reached . " while saying the army 's mandate needed to be looked at again , gertz , however , did not call for the withdrawal of german troops out of afghanistan . ´ the german parliament is scheduled to vote on a whether to extend the army 's mandate in the autumn .
some politicians have called for changes in the pair of mandates under which the bundeswehr is deployed in afghanistan after the weekend 's attack . " the discussion about this was tough enough already in the spd , " rolf muetzenich , a foreign policy expert in the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
" a terrible attack like this will obviously have an influence when it comes to deciding on whether to extend the mandate . " staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casulties in afghanistan are on the rise the social democrats share power with angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
members of both parties said they will not pull out of afghanistan because of the attacks . " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it , " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the spd told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . " german defense minister franz josef jung also said the attack would not alter germany 's peacekeeping obligations in afghanistan . " nothing will change with the mission , " he said in a television interview . the welt am sonntag newspaper applauded the resolve , saying in an editorial that any other decision would " send out the wrong signal to terrorists worldwide , to germany 's allies in nato and to the international community . " new strategy needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine of the left party wants troops pulled out of the country while conservative politicians stand firmly behind the military involvement , many germans disapprove of the military playing an active role abroad .
left-wing politicians renewed calls for a different strategy . greens party head reinhard bütikofer called for the german government to shift its focus to rebuilding the civilian infrastructures in afghanistan . " we 've been of the opinion for some time that we must change the overall strategy , " bütikofer said in a television interview monday .
oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .
lafontaine went a step further , accusing the german bundeswehr of engaging in terrorism activities in afghanistan .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to move troops into the south .
defense minister jung called lafontaine 's comment " absurd . " civilians casualties increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently sent fighter planes to afghanistan yet there are signs that jung is growing increasingly concerned about the situation there .
over the past month , afghan officials reported 50 civilians killed in us air strikes in fighting in the western province in herat , and another 21 in south central helmand province .
last monday , jung said he had complained to nato about the increasing civilian casualties . " we must ensure that operations do not develop this way .
it would not be a victory to set the -lrb- afghan -rrb- people against us , " jung said , after talks between eu defense ministers in brussels .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , largely in the north of the country .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .

but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .
the film is based on marjane 's popular comic book series . afp / dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-turkish director in competition at 60th cannes festival director fatih akin will be heading to the french riviera in may for the 60th edition of the world 's premiere film festival .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians want to reconsider the bundeswehr 's two mandates in afghanistan " if there is not a radical change in the overall strategy , we are in danger of failing in afghanistan , " he added .
" other than the fact that there have been elections , none of the major goals has been reached . " while saying the army 's mandate needed to be looked at again , gertz , however , did not call for the withdrawal of german troops out of afghanistan . ´ the german parliament is scheduled to vote on a whether to extend the army 's mandate in the autumn .
some politicians have called for changes in the pair of mandates under which the bundeswehr is deployed in afghanistan after the weekend 's attack . " the discussion about this was tough enough already in the spd , " rolf muetzenich , a foreign policy expert in the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
" a terrible attack like this will obviously have an influence when it comes to deciding on whether to extend the mandate . " staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casulties in afghanistan are on the rise the social democrats share power with angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
members of both parties said they will not pull out of afghanistan because of the attacks . " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it , " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the spd told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . " german defense minister franz josef jung also said the attack would not alter germany 's peacekeeping obligations in afghanistan . " nothing will change with the mission , " he said in a television interview . the welt am sonntag newspaper applauded the resolve , saying in an editorial that any other decision would " send out the wrong signal to terrorists worldwide , to germany 's allies in nato and to the international community . " new strategy needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine of the left party wants troops pulled out of the country while conservative politicians stand firmly behind the military involvement , many germans disapprove of the military playing an active role abroad .
left-wing politicians renewed calls for a different strategy . greens party head reinhard bütikofer called for the german government to shift its focus to rebuilding the civilian infrastructures in afghanistan . " we 've been of the opinion for some time that we must change the overall strategy , " bütikofer said in a television interview monday .
oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .
lafontaine went a step further , accusing the german bundeswehr of engaging in terrorism activities in afghanistan .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to move troops into the south .
defense minister jung called lafontaine 's comment " absurd . " civilians casualties increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently sent fighter planes to afghanistan yet there are signs that jung is growing increasingly concerned about the situation there .
over the past month , afghan officials reported 50 civilians killed in us air strikes in fighting in the western province in herat , and another 21 in south central helmand province .
last monday , jung said he had complained to nato about the increasing civilian casualties . " we must ensure that operations do not develop this way .
it would not be a victory to set the -lrb- afghan -rrb- people against us , " jung said , after talks between eu defense ministers in brussels .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , largely in the north of the country .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .
predecessors performed well , but were tainted by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo kleinfeld lost the board 's confidence that löscher will be assuming the top job on july 1 , at a time of record profits , is an added advantage .
the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .
" at the end of the day , it boils down to the individual , " he said .

's brother saddam was killed sunday during a gun battle in northern lebanon .
he was one of six people suspected in a failed plot to bomb german trains last year . youssef mohammed is believed to be one of two people who allegedly placed the bombs on regional trains in leaving cologne last summer and is currently in custody in germany awaiting trial . saddam e.h. was believed to have helped plan the attack , but had not been apprehended . leader of militant group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in lebanon has brought concerns of instability saddam e.h. was allegedly a high-ranking member of the militant fatah islam group .
german investigators suspected a terrorist organization was behind the train bombing plot . " he is the deputy of another militant killed in the clashes , " a senior security official told the afp news agency on monday . the official identified the other militant killed as abu yazan , the number three of the fatah islam group .
the official , who insisted on anonymity , said abu yazan was directly responsible for twin bus bombings in ain alaq , a christian village in the mountains outside beirut in february that killed three people . the two islamists were among the 10 bodies found in a building in the northern port city of tripoli after it was raided by lebanese troops on sunday . fatah islam has denied having any organizational links to al-qaida terrorist organization . the group is headed by shaker abssi , said to be linked to the former leader of al-qaida in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who was killed in a us raid in 2006 . stability threatened germany , current holder of the rotating european union presidency , called on all parties to show restraint to prevent lebanon slipping further into conflict after two days of fighting .

the fighting has killed 55 people dead and renewed fears about lebanon 's stability .
it is the worst explosion of violence - excluding warfare with israel - since the 1975-1990 civil war . " the blows dealt by fatah al-islam against the lebanese army are a premeditated crime and a dangerous attempt to destabilize -lrb- lebanon -rrb- , " prime minister fuad siniora said on sunday . his western-backed government has been paralyzed for months by an acute political crisis pitting opponents of former power broker damascus against pro-syrian factions . humanitarian crisis feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lebanese firefighter tries to extinguish burning cars lebanese leaders said they would take " all necessary measures " to restore order , while the international community appealed for an end to the violence that continued monday . warships patrolled nearby coastal waters and troop exchanged artillery and machinegun fire with militants . officials said they are fearful for the refugees caught in the middle of the fighting . " we are deeply concerned about the developing humanitarian crisis , particularly the danger to civilian lives , " un palestinian refugee agency director richard cook said . doctors describe seeing bodies strewn on the streets of the nahr al-bared , which like all other refugee camps in lebanon remain outside the control of the government and in the hands of palestinian factions . lebanese red cross spokesman george kettaneh told the dpa news agency that they managed to evacuate 11 wounded from the camp after a short lull was observed .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .
köhler will likely have to address this issue , at least behind closed doors . focus on energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people 's bank of china in beijing : a symbol of china 's rising economic prowess after his two-day stay in vietnam , the german president will travel to china , where he is set to meet with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao in beijing . in china , köhler 's itinerary is centered on energy policy .
he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .
köhler will likely have to address this issue , at least behind closed doors . focus on energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people 's bank of china in beijing : a symbol of china 's rising economic prowess after his two-day stay in vietnam , the german president will travel to china , where he is set to meet with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao in beijing . in china , köhler 's itinerary is centered on energy policy .
he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .

but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .
way of the future besides having german language skills , applicants for citizenship must have lived legally in germany for at least eight years .
they may not have a criminal record and must show they can financially support themselves and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hardly homogenous in any case , a multicultural society is the way of the future , said zeynep balazümbül , one of the founders of " deukische generation , " adding that she hoped germany would become one in the next 30 years .
" that is actually the only future i see for the country , because we are an essential part of this society , " balazümbül said .
" we are here to stay .
we belong here and it 's become our home .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .

taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .

but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .

unicredit is offering 1.12 of its own shares for every capitalia share in the takeover . the new group will generate more than half of its income outside italy , thanks to unicredit 's strong position in eastern europe .

the g8 members also need to understand that they are responsible for global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 21.05.2007 siemens makes a clean break from scandal at the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens hopes that appointing an outsider will clear the clouds overhead in a complete break from the slush fund scandals that have plagued siemens ag , the board has selected a complete outsider as its head for the first time ever in the giant conglomerate 's 160 year history . there were plenty of candidates on the supervisory board 's wish list to succeed siemens chief executive klaus kleinfeld , who last month announced his decision not to prolong his contract , and will now step down on june 30 . although kleinfeld and his mentor , former chairman heinrich von pierer , were not implicated in a far-reaching corruption scandal that led to the arrest of several former top executives , their departure is a signal that the powers that be at the giant munich-based engineering and electronics conglomerate wanted to make a complete break from the past . candidates for the top job had included the previous head of daimlerchrysler 's mercedes division and the european head of general motors , according to german newspaper reports . but the candidate widely touted in the press for the top job , wolfgang reitzle , ceo of linde ag and a former boss at bmw , announced last week that he would rather stay put than switch . pharma executive as head of siemens conglomerate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löscher : a new ceo who is completely " unimpeachable " then on sunday , the siemens supervisory board under its new chairman gerhard cromme , made the surprise announcement that kleinfeld 's replacement will be peter löscher , 49 .
löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .
predecessors performed well , but were tainted by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo kleinfeld lost the board 's confidence that löscher will be assuming the top job on july 1 , at a time of record profits , is an added advantage .
the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .
" at the end of the day , it boils down to the individual , " he said .
" i 've seen low profile executives who deliver way beyond investor expectations , and well-known high fliers who do n't .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .

he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .

's brother saddam was killed sunday during a gun battle in northern lebanon .
he was one of six people suspected in a failed plot to bomb german trains last year . youssef mohammed is believed to be one of two people who allegedly placed the bombs on regional trains in leaving cologne last summer and is currently in custody in germany awaiting trial . saddam e.h. was believed to have helped plan the attack , but had not been apprehended . leader of militant group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in lebanon has brought concerns of instability saddam e.h. was allegedly a high-ranking member of the militant fatah islam group .
german investigators suspected a terrorist organization was behind the train bombing plot . " he is the deputy of another militant killed in the clashes , " a senior security official told the afp news agency on monday . the official identified the other militant killed as abu yazan , the number three of the fatah islam group .
the official , who insisted on anonymity , said abu yazan was directly responsible for twin bus bombings in ain alaq , a christian village in the mountains outside beirut in february that killed three people . the two islamists were among the 10 bodies found in a building in the northern port city of tripoli after it was raided by lebanese troops on sunday . fatah islam has denied having any organizational links to al-qaida terrorist organization . the group is headed by shaker abssi , said to be linked to the former leader of al-qaida in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who was killed in a us raid in 2006 . stability threatened germany , current holder of the rotating european union presidency , called on all parties to show restraint to prevent lebanon slipping further into conflict after two days of fighting .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured lebanese soldier receives help from lebanese red cross workers lebanese artillery pounded fighters from the fatah islam group entrenched in a palestinian refugee camp near the northern coastal city of tripoli , an afp photographer at the scene said . fatah islam has accused the government of trying to launch an offensive against palestinian camps in lebanon , which house more than half of the country 's nearly 400,000 refugees .
the fighting has killed 55 people dead and renewed fears about lebanon 's stability .
it is the worst explosion of violence - excluding warfare with israel - since the 1975-1990 civil war . " the blows dealt by fatah al-islam against the lebanese army are a premeditated crime and a dangerous attempt to destabilize -lrb- lebanon -rrb- , " prime minister fuad siniora said on sunday . his western-backed government has been paralyzed for months by an acute political crisis pitting opponents of former power broker damascus against pro-syrian factions . humanitarian crisis feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lebanese firefighter tries to extinguish burning cars lebanese leaders said they would take " all necessary measures " to restore order , while the international community appealed for an end to the violence that continued monday . warships patrolled nearby coastal waters and troop exchanged artillery and machinegun fire with militants . officials said they are fearful for the refugees caught in the middle of the fighting . " we are deeply concerned about the developing humanitarian crisis , particularly the danger to civilian lives , " un palestinian refugee agency director richard cook said . doctors describe seeing bodies strewn on the streets of the nahr al-bared , which like all other refugee camps in lebanon remain outside the control of the government and in the hands of palestinian factions . lebanese red cross spokesman george kettaneh told the dpa news agency that they managed to evacuate 11 wounded from the camp after a short lull was observed .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .
way of the future besides having german language skills , applicants for citizenship must have lived legally in germany for at least eight years .
they may not have a criminal record and must show they can financially support themselves and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hardly homogenous in any case , a multicultural society is the way of the future , said zeynep balazümbül , one of the founders of " deukische generation , " adding that she hoped germany would become one in the next 30 years .
" that is actually the only future i see for the country , because we are an essential part of this society , " balazümbül said .
" we are here to stay .
we belong here and it 's become our home .

but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .
way of the future besides having german language skills , applicants for citizenship must have lived legally in germany for at least eight years .
they may not have a criminal record and must show they can financially support themselves and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hardly homogenous in any case , a multicultural society is the way of the future , said zeynep balazümbül , one of the founders of " deukische generation , " adding that she hoped germany would become one in the next 30 years .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .

he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .

's brother saddam was killed sunday during a gun battle in northern lebanon .
he was one of six people suspected in a failed plot to bomb german trains last year . youssef mohammed is believed to be one of two people who allegedly placed the bombs on regional trains in leaving cologne last summer and is currently in custody in germany awaiting trial . saddam e.h. was believed to have helped plan the attack , but had not been apprehended . leader of militant group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in lebanon has brought concerns of instability saddam e.h. was allegedly a high-ranking member of the militant fatah islam group .
german investigators suspected a terrorist organization was behind the train bombing plot . " he is the deputy of another militant killed in the clashes , " a senior security official told the afp news agency on monday . the official identified the other militant killed as abu yazan , the number three of the fatah islam group .
the official , who insisted on anonymity , said abu yazan was directly responsible for twin bus bombings in ain alaq , a christian village in the mountains outside beirut in february that killed three people . the two islamists were among the 10 bodies found in a building in the northern port city of tripoli after it was raided by lebanese troops on sunday . fatah islam has denied having any organizational links to al-qaida terrorist organization . the group is headed by shaker abssi , said to be linked to the former leader of al-qaida in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who was killed in a us raid in 2006 . stability threatened germany , current holder of the rotating european union presidency , called on all parties to show restraint to prevent lebanon slipping further into conflict after two days of fighting . " we of course regard these battles between the lebanese army and armed groups in the palestinian refugee camps with very great concern and the government condemns the attack on the lebanese security forces in the strongest terms , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on monday .
" we can not allow lebanon to be sucked into a spiral of violence again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured lebanese soldier receives help from lebanese red cross workers lebanese artillery pounded fighters from the fatah islam group entrenched in a palestinian refugee camp near the northern coastal city of tripoli , an afp photographer at the scene said . fatah islam has accused the government of trying to launch an offensive against palestinian camps in lebanon , which house more than half of the country 's nearly 400,000 refugees .

's brother saddam was killed sunday during a gun battle in northern lebanon .
he was one of six people suspected in a failed plot to bomb german trains last year . youssef mohammed is believed to be one of two people who allegedly placed the bombs on regional trains in leaving cologne last summer and is currently in custody in germany awaiting trial . saddam e.h. was believed to have helped plan the attack , but had not been apprehended . leader of militant group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in lebanon has brought concerns of instability saddam e.h. was allegedly a high-ranking member of the militant fatah islam group .
german investigators suspected a terrorist organization was behind the train bombing plot . " he is the deputy of another militant killed in the clashes , " a senior security official told the afp news agency on monday . the official identified the other militant killed as abu yazan , the number three of the fatah islam group .
the official , who insisted on anonymity , said abu yazan was directly responsible for twin bus bombings in ain alaq , a christian village in the mountains outside beirut in february that killed three people . the two islamists were among the 10 bodies found in a building in the northern port city of tripoli after it was raided by lebanese troops on sunday . fatah islam has denied having any organizational links to al-qaida terrorist organization . the group is headed by shaker abssi , said to be linked to the former leader of al-qaida in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who was killed in a us raid in 2006 . stability threatened germany , current holder of the rotating european union presidency , called on all parties to show restraint to prevent lebanon slipping further into conflict after two days of fighting . " we of course regard these battles between the lebanese army and armed groups in the palestinian refugee camps with very great concern and the government condemns the attack on the lebanese security forces in the strongest terms , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on monday .
" we can not allow lebanon to be sucked into a spiral of violence again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured lebanese soldier receives help from lebanese red cross workers lebanese artillery pounded fighters from the fatah islam group entrenched in a palestinian refugee camp near the northern coastal city of tripoli , an afp photographer at the scene said . fatah islam has accused the government of trying to launch an offensive against palestinian camps in lebanon , which house more than half of the country 's nearly 400,000 refugees .
the fighting has killed 55 people dead and renewed fears about lebanon 's stability .
it is the worst explosion of violence - excluding warfare with israel - since the 1975-1990 civil war . " the blows dealt by fatah al-islam against the lebanese army are a premeditated crime and a dangerous attempt to destabilize -lrb- lebanon -rrb- , " prime minister fuad siniora said on sunday . his western-backed government has been paralyzed for months by an acute political crisis pitting opponents of former power broker damascus against pro-syrian factions . humanitarian crisis feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lebanese firefighter tries to extinguish burning cars lebanese leaders said they would take " all necessary measures " to restore order , while the international community appealed for an end to the violence that continued monday . warships patrolled nearby coastal waters and troop exchanged artillery and machinegun fire with militants . officials said they are fearful for the refugees caught in the middle of the fighting . " we are deeply concerned about the developing humanitarian crisis , particularly the danger to civilian lives , " un palestinian refugee agency director richard cook said . doctors describe seeing bodies strewn on the streets of the nahr al-bared , which like all other refugee camps in lebanon remain outside the control of the government and in the hands of palestinian factions . lebanese red cross spokesman george kettaneh told the dpa news agency that they managed to evacuate 11 wounded from the camp after a short lull was observed . " we will try to evacuate as many people as we can as long the lull allows us , " kentaneh said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asked to prolong lebanon force mandate germany is favorably considering a request to extend its mandate as leader of the naval component of the united nations force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , government spokesmen said .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes .

the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .

they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .

others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .

unicredit is offering 1.12 of its own shares for every capitalia share in the takeover . the new group will generate more than half of its income outside italy , thanks to unicredit 's strong position in eastern europe .
it also keeps capitalia , italy 's third-largest bank , out of the hands of prospective foreign buyers focus on europe the merged group will have about 9,200 bank branches globally , roughly 960 billion euros in total assets and 40 million customers from italy to russia .
outside of italy , unicredit will rank second biggest in germany and number one in the eastern european countries of poland , bosnia , bulgaria and croatia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicredit head profumo has ambitious plans for his bank “ we consider ourselves to be european , ” unicredit chief executive alessandro profumo said at a press conference on monday .

the italian daily la repubblica reported in the past few days there had been rumors of 7,000 redundancies by 2010 . profumo will be chief executive of the new bank , and unicredit ’ s current chairman , dieter rampl will also stay on in the same role .
capitalia chairman cesare geronzi will become vice chairman of unicredit . profumo has earned a reputation as someone more than ready to break the conventions of the rather staid world of italian finance .
he shook up normal working practices at unicredit when he took over , introducing performance targets and aggressive marketing techniques , which were unheard of until then in italy 's stuffy banking world . buying spree the takeover of capitalia is only the latest in a series of acquisitions by profumo , who only two years ago engineered europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal with the takeover of germany ’ s hypovereinsbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinbank was taken over by unicredit in 2005 there could also be more takeovers on the horizon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2007 politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinema gets political again at the 2007 cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .
but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film .

but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .

the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .

" while saying the army 's mandate needed to be looked at again , gertz , however , did not call for the withdrawal of german troops out of afghanistan . ´ the german parliament is scheduled to vote on a whether to extend the army 's mandate in the autumn .
some politicians have called for changes in the pair of mandates under which the bundeswehr is deployed in afghanistan after the weekend 's attack .

oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .

it would not be a victory to set the -lrb- afghan -rrb- people against us , " jung said , after talks between eu defense ministers in brussels .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , largely in the north of the country .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 21.05.2007 scope of human trafficking remains largely unknown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is sure exactly how many people are victims of human trafficking the mammoth proportions of human trafficking make combating it difficult .
representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .

he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .

he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .
köhler will likely have to address this issue , at least behind closed doors . focus on energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people 's bank of china in beijing : a symbol of china 's rising economic prowess after his two-day stay in vietnam , the german president will travel to china , where he is set to meet with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao in beijing . in china , köhler 's itinerary is centered on energy policy .
he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .
the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries .
-lrb- 27.04.2007 -rrb- eu , asean seek to improve ties at talks diplomats from the eu and southeast asia were expected to issue a statement pledging closer cooperation in security , trade and environmental issues , as they met for talks in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 21.05.2007 german president köhler seeks balance in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's economy is flowering , unlike its democracy , according to some critics on a week-long tour of asia that includes both vietnam , where he arrived monday , and china , german president horst köhler will have to work to find the delicate balance between diplomatic and economic interests . köhler is no stranger to foreign policy balancing acts .
during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .
köhler will likely have to address this issue , at least behind closed doors . focus on energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people 's bank of china in beijing : a symbol of china 's rising economic prowess after his two-day stay in vietnam , the german president will travel to china , where he is set to meet with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao in beijing . in china , köhler 's itinerary is centered on energy policy .
he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .
the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes .

" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 21.05.2007 scope of human trafficking remains largely unknown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is sure exactly how many people are victims of human trafficking the mammoth proportions of human trafficking make combating it difficult .
representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .
predecessors performed well , but were tainted by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo kleinfeld lost the board 's confidence that löscher will be assuming the top job on july 1 , at a time of record profits , is an added advantage .
the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .
" at the end of the day , it boils down to the individual , " he said .
" i 've seen low profile executives who deliver way beyond investor expectations , and well-known high fliers who do n't .

unicredit is offering 1.12 of its own shares for every capitalia share in the takeover . the new group will generate more than half of its income outside italy , thanks to unicredit 's strong position in eastern europe .
it also keeps capitalia , italy 's third-largest bank , out of the hands of prospective foreign buyers focus on europe the merged group will have about 9,200 bank branches globally , roughly 960 billion euros in total assets and 40 million customers from italy to russia .
outside of italy , unicredit will rank second biggest in germany and number one in the eastern european countries of poland , bosnia , bulgaria and croatia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicredit head profumo has ambitious plans for his bank “ we consider ourselves to be european , ” unicredit chief executive alessandro profumo said at a press conference on monday .
“ we want to maintain our european vision . ” profumo emphasized that for the bank , “ russia and turkey are part of europe . ” job losses when asked about redundancies , profumo said there hadn ’ t been an opportunity to settle on final numbers , but he admitted with 170,000 employees : “ it is obvious that we have to become more efficient . ”
the italian daily la repubblica reported in the past few days there had been rumors of 7,000 redundancies by 2010 . profumo will be chief executive of the new bank , and unicredit ’ s current chairman , dieter rampl will also stay on in the same role .
capitalia chairman cesare geronzi will become vice chairman of unicredit . profumo has earned a reputation as someone more than ready to break the conventions of the rather staid world of italian finance .
he shook up normal working practices at unicredit when he took over , introducing performance targets and aggressive marketing techniques , which were unheard of until then in italy 's stuffy banking world . buying spree the takeover of capitalia is only the latest in a series of acquisitions by profumo , who only two years ago engineered europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal with the takeover of germany ’ s hypovereinsbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinbank was taken over by unicredit in 2005 there could also be more takeovers on the horizon .
it ’ s common knowledge that profumo was looking at a possible unicredit merger with the french banking giant , societe generale -lrb- socgen -rrb- , before deciding to go with capitalia . on monday in an interview with la repubblica , geronzi said current market trends meant “ anything was possible ” and described a deal with socgen as " favorable " . government behind deal the proposed capitalia takeover has already received the backing of the italian government , with prime minister romano prodi and economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa saying they supported the move .
however , it still needs approval from italy 's central bank and antitrust authorities . in a jointly released statement , the banks said they hoped to complete this process by the start of october . conditions have been ripe for consolidation of italian banks since bank of italy governor mario draghi last year threw out rules requiring banks to notify the government in advance of mergers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2007 politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinema gets political again at the 2007 cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .
but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .

" the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .

but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom .

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .

the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .

" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .
" this is a big industry and a lot of money is made .

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .
predecessors performed well , but were tainted by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo kleinfeld lost the board 's confidence that löscher will be assuming the top job on july 1 , at a time of record profits , is an added advantage .
the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .
" at the end of the day , it boils down to the individual , " he said .
" i 've seen low profile executives who deliver way beyond investor expectations , and well-known high fliers who do n't .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 21.05.2007 german president köhler seeks balance in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's economy is flowering , unlike its democracy , according to some critics on a week-long tour of asia that includes both vietnam , where he arrived monday , and china , german president horst köhler will have to work to find the delicate balance between diplomatic and economic interests . köhler is no stranger to foreign policy balancing acts .
during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .
köhler will likely have to address this issue , at least behind closed doors . focus on energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people 's bank of china in beijing : a symbol of china 's rising economic prowess after his two-day stay in vietnam , the german president will travel to china , where he is set to meet with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao in beijing . in china , köhler 's itinerary is centered on energy policy .
he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .

the italian daily la repubblica reported in the past few days there had been rumors of 7,000 redundancies by 2010 . profumo will be chief executive of the new bank , and unicredit ’ s current chairman , dieter rampl will also stay on in the same role .

he shook up normal working practices at unicredit when he took over , introducing performance targets and aggressive marketing techniques , which were unheard of until then in italy 's stuffy banking world . buying spree the takeover of capitalia is only the latest in a series of acquisitions by profumo , who only two years ago engineered europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal with the takeover of germany ’ s hypovereinsbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinbank was taken over by unicredit in 2005 there could also be more takeovers on the horizon .
it ’ s common knowledge that profumo was looking at a possible unicredit merger with the french banking giant , societe generale -lrb- socgen -rrb- , before deciding to go with capitalia . on monday in an interview with la repubblica , geronzi said current market trends meant “ anything was possible ” and described a deal with socgen as " favorable " . government behind deal the proposed capitalia takeover has already received the backing of the italian government , with prime minister romano prodi and economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa saying they supported the move .
however , it still needs approval from italy 's central bank and antitrust authorities . in a jointly released statement , the banks said they hoped to complete this process by the start of october . conditions have been ripe for consolidation of italian banks since bank of italy governor mario draghi last year threw out rules requiring banks to notify the government in advance of mergers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2007 politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinema gets political again at the 2007 cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .
but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .
the film is based on marjane 's popular comic book series . afp / dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-turkish director in competition at 60th cannes festival director fatih akin will be heading to the french riviera in may for the 60th edition of the world 's premiere film festival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 21.05.2007 scope of human trafficking remains largely unknown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is sure exactly how many people are victims of human trafficking the mammoth proportions of human trafficking make combating it difficult .
representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians want to reconsider the bundeswehr 's two mandates in afghanistan " if there is not a radical change in the overall strategy , we are in danger of failing in afghanistan , " he added .
" other than the fact that there have been elections , none of the major goals has been reached . " while saying the army 's mandate needed to be looked at again , gertz , however , did not call for the withdrawal of german troops out of afghanistan . ´ the german parliament is scheduled to vote on a whether to extend the army 's mandate in the autumn .
some politicians have called for changes in the pair of mandates under which the bundeswehr is deployed in afghanistan after the weekend 's attack . " the discussion about this was tough enough already in the spd , " rolf muetzenich , a foreign policy expert in the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
" a terrible attack like this will obviously have an influence when it comes to deciding on whether to extend the mandate . " staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casulties in afghanistan are on the rise the social democrats share power with angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
members of both parties said they will not pull out of afghanistan because of the attacks . " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it , " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the spd told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . " german defense minister franz josef jung also said the attack would not alter germany 's peacekeeping obligations in afghanistan . " nothing will change with the mission , " he said in a television interview . the welt am sonntag newspaper applauded the resolve , saying in an editorial that any other decision would " send out the wrong signal to terrorists worldwide , to germany 's allies in nato and to the international community . " new strategy needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine of the left party wants troops pulled out of the country while conservative politicians stand firmly behind the military involvement , many germans disapprove of the military playing an active role abroad .
left-wing politicians renewed calls for a different strategy . greens party head reinhard bütikofer called for the german government to shift its focus to rebuilding the civilian infrastructures in afghanistan . " we 've been of the opinion for some time that we must change the overall strategy , " bütikofer said in a television interview monday .
oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .
lafontaine went a step further , accusing the german bundeswehr of engaging in terrorism activities in afghanistan .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to move troops into the south .
defense minister jung called lafontaine 's comment " absurd . " civilians casualties increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently sent fighter planes to afghanistan yet there are signs that jung is growing increasingly concerned about the situation there .
over the past month , afghan officials reported 50 civilians killed in us air strikes in fighting in the western province in herat , and another 21 in south central helmand province .
last monday , jung said he had complained to nato about the increasing civilian casualties . " we must ensure that operations do not develop this way .
it would not be a victory to set the -lrb- afghan -rrb- people against us , " jung said , after talks between eu defense ministers in brussels .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , largely in the north of the country .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .
way of the future besides having german language skills , applicants for citizenship must have lived legally in germany for at least eight years .
they may not have a criminal record and must show they can financially support themselves and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hardly homogenous in any case , a multicultural society is the way of the future , said zeynep balazümbül , one of the founders of " deukische generation , " adding that she hoped germany would become one in the next 30 years .
" that is actually the only future i see for the country , because we are an essential part of this society , " balazümbül said .

we belong here and it 's become our home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2007 politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinema gets political again at the 2007 cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .
but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .
the film is based on marjane 's popular comic book series . afp / dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-turkish director in competition at 60th cannes festival director fatih akin will be heading to the french riviera in may for the 60th edition of the world 's premiere film festival .

" nothing will change with the mission , " he said in a television interview . the welt am sonntag newspaper applauded the resolve , saying in an editorial that any other decision would " send out the wrong signal to terrorists worldwide , to germany 's allies in nato and to the international community . " new strategy needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine of the left party wants troops pulled out of the country while conservative politicians stand firmly behind the military involvement , many germans disapprove of the military playing an active role abroad .
left-wing politicians renewed calls for a different strategy . greens party head reinhard bütikofer called for the german government to shift its focus to rebuilding the civilian infrastructures in afghanistan . " we 've been of the opinion for some time that we must change the overall strategy , " bütikofer said in a television interview monday .
oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .
lafontaine went a step further , accusing the german bundeswehr of engaging in terrorism activities in afghanistan .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to move troops into the south .
defense minister jung called lafontaine 's comment " absurd . " civilians casualties increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently sent fighter planes to afghanistan yet there are signs that jung is growing increasingly concerned about the situation there .
over the past month , afghan officials reported 50 civilians killed in us air strikes in fighting in the western province in herat , and another 21 in south central helmand province .
last monday , jung said he had complained to nato about the increasing civilian casualties . " we must ensure that operations do not develop this way .
it would not be a victory to set the -lrb- afghan -rrb- people against us , " jung said , after talks between eu defense ministers in brussels .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , largely in the north of the country .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .
way of the future besides having german language skills , applicants for citizenship must have lived legally in germany for at least eight years .
they may not have a criminal record and must show they can financially support themselves and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hardly homogenous in any case , a multicultural society is the way of the future , said zeynep balazümbül , one of the founders of " deukische generation , " adding that she hoped germany would become one in the next 30 years .
" that is actually the only future i see for the country , because we are an essential part of this society , " balazümbül said .

we belong here and it 's become our home .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .
way of the future besides having german language skills , applicants for citizenship must have lived legally in germany for at least eight years .
they may not have a criminal record and must show they can financially support themselves and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hardly homogenous in any case , a multicultural society is the way of the future , said zeynep balazümbül , one of the founders of " deukische generation , " adding that she hoped germany would become one in the next 30 years .
" that is actually the only future i see for the country , because we are an essential part of this society , " balazümbül said .
" we are here to stay .
we belong here and it 's become our home .

unicredit is offering 1.12 of its own shares for every capitalia share in the takeover . the new group will generate more than half of its income outside italy , thanks to unicredit 's strong position in eastern europe .
it also keeps capitalia , italy 's third-largest bank , out of the hands of prospective foreign buyers focus on europe the merged group will have about 9,200 bank branches globally , roughly 960 billion euros in total assets and 40 million customers from italy to russia .
outside of italy , unicredit will rank second biggest in germany and number one in the eastern european countries of poland , bosnia , bulgaria and croatia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicredit head profumo has ambitious plans for his bank “ we consider ourselves to be european , ” unicredit chief executive alessandro profumo said at a press conference on monday .
“ we want to maintain our european vision . ” profumo emphasized that for the bank , “ russia and turkey are part of europe . ” job losses when asked about redundancies , profumo said there hadn ’ t been an opportunity to settle on final numbers , but he admitted with 170,000 employees : “ it is obvious that we have to become more efficient . ”
the italian daily la repubblica reported in the past few days there had been rumors of 7,000 redundancies by 2010 . profumo will be chief executive of the new bank , and unicredit ’ s current chairman , dieter rampl will also stay on in the same role .
capitalia chairman cesare geronzi will become vice chairman of unicredit . profumo has earned a reputation as someone more than ready to break the conventions of the rather staid world of italian finance .
he shook up normal working practices at unicredit when he took over , introducing performance targets and aggressive marketing techniques , which were unheard of until then in italy 's stuffy banking world . buying spree the takeover of capitalia is only the latest in a series of acquisitions by profumo , who only two years ago engineered europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal with the takeover of germany ’ s hypovereinsbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypovereinbank was taken over by unicredit in 2005 there could also be more takeovers on the horizon .
it ’ s common knowledge that profumo was looking at a possible unicredit merger with the french banking giant , societe generale -lrb- socgen -rrb- , before deciding to go with capitalia . on monday in an interview with la repubblica , geronzi said current market trends meant “ anything was possible ” and described a deal with socgen as " favorable " . government behind deal the proposed capitalia takeover has already received the backing of the italian government , with prime minister romano prodi and economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa saying they supported the move .
however , it still needs approval from italy 's central bank and antitrust authorities . in a jointly released statement , the banks said they hoped to complete this process by the start of october . conditions have been ripe for consolidation of italian banks since bank of italy governor mario draghi last year threw out rules requiring banks to notify the government in advance of mergers .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2007 politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinema gets political again at the 2007 cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .
but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?

but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .

" the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort .

's brother saddam was killed sunday during a gun battle in northern lebanon .
he was one of six people suspected in a failed plot to bomb german trains last year . youssef mohammed is believed to be one of two people who allegedly placed the bombs on regional trains in leaving cologne last summer and is currently in custody in germany awaiting trial . saddam e.h. was believed to have helped plan the attack , but had not been apprehended . leader of militant group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in lebanon has brought concerns of instability saddam e.h. was allegedly a high-ranking member of the militant fatah islam group .
german investigators suspected a terrorist organization was behind the train bombing plot . " he is the deputy of another militant killed in the clashes , " a senior security official told the afp news agency on monday . the official identified the other militant killed as abu yazan , the number three of the fatah islam group .
the official , who insisted on anonymity , said abu yazan was directly responsible for twin bus bombings in ain alaq , a christian village in the mountains outside beirut in february that killed three people . the two islamists were among the 10 bodies found in a building in the northern port city of tripoli after it was raided by lebanese troops on sunday . fatah islam has denied having any organizational links to al-qaida terrorist organization . the group is headed by shaker abssi , said to be linked to the former leader of al-qaida in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who was killed in a us raid in 2006 . stability threatened germany , current holder of the rotating european union presidency , called on all parties to show restraint to prevent lebanon slipping further into conflict after two days of fighting .

the fighting has killed 55 people dead and renewed fears about lebanon 's stability .
it is the worst explosion of violence - excluding warfare with israel - since the 1975-1990 civil war . " the blows dealt by fatah al-islam against the lebanese army are a premeditated crime and a dangerous attempt to destabilize -lrb- lebanon -rrb- , " prime minister fuad siniora said on sunday . his western-backed government has been paralyzed for months by an acute political crisis pitting opponents of former power broker damascus against pro-syrian factions . humanitarian crisis feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lebanese firefighter tries to extinguish burning cars lebanese leaders said they would take " all necessary measures " to restore order , while the international community appealed for an end to the violence that continued monday . warships patrolled nearby coastal waters and troop exchanged artillery and machinegun fire with militants . officials said they are fearful for the refugees caught in the middle of the fighting . " we are deeply concerned about the developing humanitarian crisis , particularly the danger to civilian lives , " un palestinian refugee agency director richard cook said . doctors describe seeing bodies strewn on the streets of the nahr al-bared , which like all other refugee camps in lebanon remain outside the control of the government and in the hands of palestinian factions . lebanese red cross spokesman george kettaneh told the dpa news agency that they managed to evacuate 11 wounded from the camp after a short lull was observed .

readers shared mixed opinions on whether the germany army should continue its mission . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i believe germany 's military should stay in afghanistan .
afghanistan is a place where more of the prominent countries can unite against terrorism without the universal condemnation that is prevalent in iraq .
the fight against terrorism in afghanistan , especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , had the whole world singing from the same page until the us took the fight to iraq .
germany has a good , strong and competent military .
although germany and the us have many differences of opinion , especially nowadays , the german military can be a strong complement to the overall effort in afghanistan . - dennis mcclure , us germans should not enlarge their involvement in afghanistan simply because there is no rationale for taming the afghans using foreign military force , as history clearly proves .
you ca n't justify military intervention simply to teach others some hogwash about democracy when the purpose of this is not transparent .
why should you lose german lives when the cause is missing ?
the american bandwagon will prove very bumpy for those who choose to ride it . - major general aps chauhan -lrb- rtd . -rrb- , india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army has been targeted since it agreed to send tornado planes of course germany should send troops to the south .
germany needs to assist in the direct combat with the taliban .
how can you expect to win a war if your army does not fight ?
one would think that , to completely eradicate the stigma of wwii , german troops fighting alongside the allies would be a good sign that germany has moved on and is prepared to shoulder its share of the burden in keeping the world safe .
it 's time germany was seen by the world as the good guy , ready to fight for a righteous cause . - peter , australia this may be the one place in the world where nato can make a difference .
so much of this " war on terror " is a path of self destruction .
if in the end we can improve life for the afghan people , then this might be a good thing .
but i do n't know if nato should stay there forever . - lee davis , oregon , us german troops should not have been sent abroad anywhere .
i followed the english speaking press all the years of the war against terror and our allies are not even aware of german involvement .

" the discussion about this was tough enough already in the spd , " rolf muetzenich , a foreign policy expert in the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
" a terrible attack like this will obviously have an influence when it comes to deciding on whether to extend the mandate . " staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casulties in afghanistan are on the rise the social democrats share power with angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
members of both parties said they will not pull out of afghanistan because of the attacks . " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it , " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the spd told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . " german defense minister franz josef jung also said the attack would not alter germany 's peacekeeping obligations in afghanistan . " nothing will change with the mission , " he said in a television interview . the welt am sonntag newspaper applauded the resolve , saying in an editorial that any other decision would " send out the wrong signal to terrorists worldwide , to germany 's allies in nato and to the international community . " new strategy needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine of the left party wants troops pulled out of the country while conservative politicians stand firmly behind the military involvement , many germans disapprove of the military playing an active role abroad .
left-wing politicians renewed calls for a different strategy . greens party head reinhard bütikofer called for the german government to shift its focus to rebuilding the civilian infrastructures in afghanistan . " we 've been of the opinion for some time that we must change the overall strategy , " bütikofer said in a television interview monday .
oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .
lafontaine went a step further , accusing the german bundeswehr of engaging in terrorism activities in afghanistan .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to move troops into the south .
defense minister jung called lafontaine 's comment " absurd . " civilians casualties increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently sent fighter planes to afghanistan yet there are signs that jung is growing increasingly concerned about the situation there .
over the past month , afghan officials reported 50 civilians killed in us air strikes in fighting in the western province in herat , and another 21 in south central helmand province .
last monday , jung said he had complained to nato about the increasing civilian casualties . " we must ensure that operations do not develop this way .
it would not be a victory to set the -lrb- afghan -rrb- people against us , " jung said , after talks between eu defense ministers in brussels .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , largely in the north of the country .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .
" this is a big industry and a lot of money is made .

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .
predecessors performed well , but were tainted by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo kleinfeld lost the board 's confidence that löscher will be assuming the top job on july 1 , at a time of record profits , is an added advantage .
the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .
" at the end of the day , it boils down to the individual , " he said .
" i 've seen low profile executives who deliver way beyond investor expectations , and well-known high fliers who do n't .

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .

langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .

other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .

he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .

a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .
" this is a big industry and a lot of money is made .

's brother saddam was killed sunday during a gun battle in northern lebanon .
he was one of six people suspected in a failed plot to bomb german trains last year . youssef mohammed is believed to be one of two people who allegedly placed the bombs on regional trains in leaving cologne last summer and is currently in custody in germany awaiting trial . saddam e.h. was believed to have helped plan the attack , but had not been apprehended . leader of militant group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in lebanon has brought concerns of instability saddam e.h. was allegedly a high-ranking member of the militant fatah islam group .
german investigators suspected a terrorist organization was behind the train bombing plot . " he is the deputy of another militant killed in the clashes , " a senior security official told the afp news agency on monday . the official identified the other militant killed as abu yazan , the number three of the fatah islam group .
the official , who insisted on anonymity , said abu yazan was directly responsible for twin bus bombings in ain alaq , a christian village in the mountains outside beirut in february that killed three people . the two islamists were among the 10 bodies found in a building in the northern port city of tripoli after it was raided by lebanese troops on sunday . fatah islam has denied having any organizational links to al-qaida terrorist organization . the group is headed by shaker abssi , said to be linked to the former leader of al-qaida in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who was killed in a us raid in 2006 . stability threatened germany , current holder of the rotating european union presidency , called on all parties to show restraint to prevent lebanon slipping further into conflict after two days of fighting . " we of course regard these battles between the lebanese army and armed groups in the palestinian refugee camps with very great concern and the government condemns the attack on the lebanese security forces in the strongest terms , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on monday .
" we can not allow lebanon to be sucked into a spiral of violence again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured lebanese soldier receives help from lebanese red cross workers lebanese artillery pounded fighters from the fatah islam group entrenched in a palestinian refugee camp near the northern coastal city of tripoli , an afp photographer at the scene said . fatah islam has accused the government of trying to launch an offensive against palestinian camps in lebanon , which house more than half of the country 's nearly 400,000 refugees .
the fighting has killed 55 people dead and renewed fears about lebanon 's stability .
it is the worst explosion of violence - excluding warfare with israel - since the 1975-1990 civil war . " the blows dealt by fatah al-islam against the lebanese army are a premeditated crime and a dangerous attempt to destabilize -lrb- lebanon -rrb- , " prime minister fuad siniora said on sunday . his western-backed government has been paralyzed for months by an acute political crisis pitting opponents of former power broker damascus against pro-syrian factions . humanitarian crisis feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lebanese firefighter tries to extinguish burning cars lebanese leaders said they would take " all necessary measures " to restore order , while the international community appealed for an end to the violence that continued monday . warships patrolled nearby coastal waters and troop exchanged artillery and machinegun fire with militants . officials said they are fearful for the refugees caught in the middle of the fighting . " we are deeply concerned about the developing humanitarian crisis , particularly the danger to civilian lives , " un palestinian refugee agency director richard cook said . doctors describe seeing bodies strewn on the streets of the nahr al-bared , which like all other refugee camps in lebanon remain outside the control of the government and in the hands of palestinian factions . lebanese red cross spokesman george kettaneh told the dpa news agency that they managed to evacuate 11 wounded from the camp after a short lull was observed .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .

human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-vietnamese cultural ties date back to the cold war era but education and culture are also important areas of german-vietnamese relations .
cooperation in this area dates back to germany 's own communist past : some 90,000 vietnamese workers and 10,000 academics were educated in the former east germany . today , roughly 2,500 vietnamese students are enrolled at german universities . to emphasize this bond , köhler plans to visit the goethe-institute in hanoi to discuss current topics with young german teachers .
he also plans to attend a german-vietnamese forum on education , science and law . human rights activists jailed discussions about vietnam 's human rights record are likely to be more a test of köhler 's diplomatic skills .
human rights organizations have criticized the vietnamese leadership for suppressing meaningful political opposition and democratic development . only recently , several human rights activists were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for allegedly disseminating " propaganda against the socialist republic " by organizing a peaceful free-speech rally . the european union has sharply criticized the vietnamese government for its actions and has called on its leadership to release all peaceful political activists .

he plans to visit a german-backed solar-cell project in the southwestern province of yunnan , where several remote mountain towns are now solar-powered . köhler also plans to meet with representatives from various environmental organizations to discuss strategies for mitigating the consequences of china 's enormous industrial growth . the other burning question is how to satisfy china 's seemingly insatiable demand for energy resources and raw material . china 's energy-policy under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china consumes enormous amounts of energy while addressing the issues in the past , köhler has cautioned emerging nations against the exploitation of the world 's resources .
he is especially concerned about africa , where newly industrialized countries , especially china and india , have increasingly been tapping into the continent 's abundant natural resources . köhler has said africa 's great mineral wealth should benefit african nations first , and he has expressed concern that the rapid depletion of its resources would reverse what köhler calls positive developments towards responsible governance . the german president is expected to voice this same concern to the chinese leadership , which has been mining african resources more intensively as its own demand increases . dw staff -lrb- monika dittrich / ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de human rights activists want germany to pressure china , russia germany needs to use its influence to improve individual freedoms in china and russia , human rights activists said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2007 politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinema gets political again at the 2007 cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .
but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .

but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .
predecessors performed well , but were tainted by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo kleinfeld lost the board 's confidence that löscher will be assuming the top job on july 1 , at a time of record profits , is an added advantage .
the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .
" at the end of the day , it boils down to the individual , " he said .

unicredit is offering 1.12 of its own shares for every capitalia share in the takeover . the new group will generate more than half of its income outside italy , thanks to unicredit 's strong position in eastern europe .
it also keeps capitalia , italy 's third-largest bank , out of the hands of prospective foreign buyers focus on europe the merged group will have about 9,200 bank branches globally , roughly 960 billion euros in total assets and 40 million customers from italy to russia .

it ’ s common knowledge that profumo was looking at a possible unicredit merger with the french banking giant , societe generale -lrb- socgen -rrb- , before deciding to go with capitalia . on monday in an interview with la repubblica , geronzi said current market trends meant “ anything was possible ” and described a deal with socgen as " favorable " . government behind deal the proposed capitalia takeover has already received the backing of the italian government , with prime minister romano prodi and economy minister tommaso padoa-schioppa saying they supported the move .
however , it still needs approval from italy 's central bank and antitrust authorities . in a jointly released statement , the banks said they hoped to complete this process by the start of october . conditions have been ripe for consolidation of italian banks since bank of italy governor mario draghi last year threw out rules requiring banks to notify the government in advance of mergers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 21.05.2007 scope of human trafficking remains largely unknown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is sure exactly how many people are victims of human trafficking the mammoth proportions of human trafficking make combating it difficult .
representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .
" this is a big industry and a lot of money is made .

oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .
lafontaine went a step further , accusing the german bundeswehr of engaging in terrorism activities in afghanistan .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to move troops into the south .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians want to reconsider the bundeswehr 's two mandates in afghanistan " if there is not a radical change in the overall strategy , we are in danger of failing in afghanistan , " he added .
" other than the fact that there have been elections , none of the major goals has been reached . " while saying the army 's mandate needed to be looked at again , gertz , however , did not call for the withdrawal of german troops out of afghanistan . ´ the german parliament is scheduled to vote on a whether to extend the army 's mandate in the autumn .
some politicians have called for changes in the pair of mandates under which the bundeswehr is deployed in afghanistan after the weekend 's attack . " the discussion about this was tough enough already in the spd , " rolf muetzenich , a foreign policy expert in the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
" a terrible attack like this will obviously have an influence when it comes to deciding on whether to extend the mandate . " staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casulties in afghanistan are on the rise the social democrats share power with angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
members of both parties said they will not pull out of afghanistan because of the attacks . " even though this was a serious attack , we must n't base our entire assessment of the situation on it , " walter kolbow , the deputy head of the parliamentary party of the spd told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" it is justified to prolong the mandate -lrb- for german troops to stay in afghanistan -rrb- . " german defense minister franz josef jung also said the attack would not alter germany 's peacekeeping obligations in afghanistan . " nothing will change with the mission , " he said in a television interview . the welt am sonntag newspaper applauded the resolve , saying in an editorial that any other decision would " send out the wrong signal to terrorists worldwide , to germany 's allies in nato and to the international community . " new strategy needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine of the left party wants troops pulled out of the country while conservative politicians stand firmly behind the military involvement , many germans disapprove of the military playing an active role abroad .
left-wing politicians renewed calls for a different strategy . greens party head reinhard bütikofer called for the german government to shift its focus to rebuilding the civilian infrastructures in afghanistan . " we 've been of the opinion for some time that we must change the overall strategy , " bütikofer said in a television interview monday .
oskar lafontaine , the former spd chairman who now heads the left party said germany should pull troops from afghanistan and focus on providing development aid to help rebuild the country .
lafontaine 's party has taken votes from the spd in recent years , in part because of their opposition to german military involvement abroad .
lafontaine went a step further , accusing the german bundeswehr of engaging in terrorism activities in afghanistan .
germany recently deployed tornado jets to afghanistan to carry out surveillance missions to aid us-led troops in hunting down taliban fighters , but the government has refused to move troops into the south .
defense minister jung called lafontaine 's comment " absurd . " civilians casualties increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently sent fighter planes to afghanistan yet there are signs that jung is growing increasingly concerned about the situation there .
over the past month , afghan officials reported 50 civilians killed in us air strikes in fighting in the western province in herat , and another 21 in south central helmand province .
last monday , jung said he had complained to nato about the increasing civilian casualties . " we must ensure that operations do not develop this way .
it would not be a victory to set the -lrb- afghan -rrb- people against us , " jung said , after talks between eu defense ministers in brussels .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , largely in the north of the country .
the north of afghanistan has seen relatively little of the violence linked to a taliban-led insurgency plaguing the south and east , but the taliban vowed last month to intensify attacks in the north .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .
way of the future besides having german language skills , applicants for citizenship must have lived legally in germany for at least eight years .
they may not have a criminal record and must show they can financially support themselves and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hardly homogenous in any case , a multicultural society is the way of the future , said zeynep balazümbül , one of the founders of " deukische generation , " adding that she hoped germany would become one in the next 30 years .
" that is actually the only future i see for the country , because we are an essential part of this society , " balazümbül said .

's brother saddam was killed sunday during a gun battle in northern lebanon .
he was one of six people suspected in a failed plot to bomb german trains last year . youssef mohammed is believed to be one of two people who allegedly placed the bombs on regional trains in leaving cologne last summer and is currently in custody in germany awaiting trial . saddam e.h. was believed to have helped plan the attack , but had not been apprehended . leader of militant group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in lebanon has brought concerns of instability saddam e.h. was allegedly a high-ranking member of the militant fatah islam group .
german investigators suspected a terrorist organization was behind the train bombing plot . " he is the deputy of another militant killed in the clashes , " a senior security official told the afp news agency on monday . the official identified the other militant killed as abu yazan , the number three of the fatah islam group .
the official , who insisted on anonymity , said abu yazan was directly responsible for twin bus bombings in ain alaq , a christian village in the mountains outside beirut in february that killed three people . the two islamists were among the 10 bodies found in a building in the northern port city of tripoli after it was raided by lebanese troops on sunday . fatah islam has denied having any organizational links to al-qaida terrorist organization . the group is headed by shaker abssi , said to be linked to the former leader of al-qaida in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who was killed in a us raid in 2006 . stability threatened germany , current holder of the rotating european union presidency , called on all parties to show restraint to prevent lebanon slipping further into conflict after two days of fighting . " we of course regard these battles between the lebanese army and armed groups in the palestinian refugee camps with very great concern and the government condemns the attack on the lebanese security forces in the strongest terms , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on monday .
" we can not allow lebanon to be sucked into a spiral of violence again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured lebanese soldier receives help from lebanese red cross workers lebanese artillery pounded fighters from the fatah islam group entrenched in a palestinian refugee camp near the northern coastal city of tripoli , an afp photographer at the scene said . fatah islam has accused the government of trying to launch an offensive against palestinian camps in lebanon , which house more than half of the country 's nearly 400,000 refugees .
the fighting has killed 55 people dead and renewed fears about lebanon 's stability .
it is the worst explosion of violence - excluding warfare with israel - since the 1975-1990 civil war . " the blows dealt by fatah al-islam against the lebanese army are a premeditated crime and a dangerous attempt to destabilize -lrb- lebanon -rrb- , " prime minister fuad siniora said on sunday . his western-backed government has been paralyzed for months by an acute political crisis pitting opponents of former power broker damascus against pro-syrian factions . humanitarian crisis feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lebanese firefighter tries to extinguish burning cars lebanese leaders said they would take " all necessary measures " to restore order , while the international community appealed for an end to the violence that continued monday . warships patrolled nearby coastal waters and troop exchanged artillery and machinegun fire with militants . officials said they are fearful for the refugees caught in the middle of the fighting . " we are deeply concerned about the developing humanitarian crisis , particularly the danger to civilian lives , " un palestinian refugee agency director richard cook said . doctors describe seeing bodies strewn on the streets of the nahr al-bared , which like all other refugee camps in lebanon remain outside the control of the government and in the hands of palestinian factions . lebanese red cross spokesman george kettaneh told the dpa news agency that they managed to evacuate 11 wounded from the camp after a short lull was observed .

readers shared mixed opinions on whether the germany army should continue its mission . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i believe germany 's military should stay in afghanistan .
afghanistan is a place where more of the prominent countries can unite against terrorism without the universal condemnation that is prevalent in iraq .
the fight against terrorism in afghanistan , especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , had the whole world singing from the same page until the us took the fight to iraq .
germany has a good , strong and competent military .
although germany and the us have many differences of opinion , especially nowadays , the german military can be a strong complement to the overall effort in afghanistan . - dennis mcclure , us germans should not enlarge their involvement in afghanistan simply because there is no rationale for taming the afghans using foreign military force , as history clearly proves .
you ca n't justify military intervention simply to teach others some hogwash about democracy when the purpose of this is not transparent .
why should you lose german lives when the cause is missing ?
the american bandwagon will prove very bumpy for those who choose to ride it . - major general aps chauhan -lrb- rtd . -rrb- , india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army has been targeted since it agreed to send tornado planes of course germany should send troops to the south .
germany needs to assist in the direct combat with the taliban .
how can you expect to win a war if your army does not fight ?
one would think that , to completely eradicate the stigma of wwii , german troops fighting alongside the allies would be a good sign that germany has moved on and is prepared to shoulder its share of the burden in keeping the world safe .
it 's time germany was seen by the world as the good guy , ready to fight for a righteous cause . - peter , australia this may be the one place in the world where nato can make a difference .
so much of this " war on terror " is a path of self destruction .
if in the end we can improve life for the afghan people , then this might be a good thing .
but i do n't know if nato should stay there forever . - lee davis , oregon , us german troops should not have been sent abroad anywhere .
i followed the english speaking press all the years of the war against terror and our allies are not even aware of german involvement .
let the " real soldiers , " namely the us , britain and australia , get on with their war by themselves . - hermann buhler , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide attack renews concerns over afghanistan mission a suicide attack by the taliban , which killed three german soldiers and injured five others , has brought renewed calls from the left for the government to rethink the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .
way of the future besides having german language skills , applicants for citizenship must have lived legally in germany for at least eight years .
they may not have a criminal record and must show they can financially support themselves and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hardly homogenous in any case , a multicultural society is the way of the future , said zeynep balazümbül , one of the founders of " deukische generation , " adding that she hoped germany would become one in the next 30 years .
" that is actually the only future i see for the country , because we are an essential part of this society , " balazümbül said .
" we are here to stay .
we belong here and it 's become our home .

's brother saddam was killed sunday during a gun battle in northern lebanon .
he was one of six people suspected in a failed plot to bomb german trains last year . youssef mohammed is believed to be one of two people who allegedly placed the bombs on regional trains in leaving cologne last summer and is currently in custody in germany awaiting trial . saddam e.h. was believed to have helped plan the attack , but had not been apprehended . leader of militant group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in lebanon has brought concerns of instability saddam e.h. was allegedly a high-ranking member of the militant fatah islam group .
german investigators suspected a terrorist organization was behind the train bombing plot . " he is the deputy of another militant killed in the clashes , " a senior security official told the afp news agency on monday . the official identified the other militant killed as abu yazan , the number three of the fatah islam group .
the official , who insisted on anonymity , said abu yazan was directly responsible for twin bus bombings in ain alaq , a christian village in the mountains outside beirut in february that killed three people . the two islamists were among the 10 bodies found in a building in the northern port city of tripoli after it was raided by lebanese troops on sunday . fatah islam has denied having any organizational links to al-qaida terrorist organization . the group is headed by shaker abssi , said to be linked to the former leader of al-qaida in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who was killed in a us raid in 2006 . stability threatened germany , current holder of the rotating european union presidency , called on all parties to show restraint to prevent lebanon slipping further into conflict after two days of fighting . " we of course regard these battles between the lebanese army and armed groups in the palestinian refugee camps with very great concern and the government condemns the attack on the lebanese security forces in the strongest terms , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on monday .
" we can not allow lebanon to be sucked into a spiral of violence again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured lebanese soldier receives help from lebanese red cross workers lebanese artillery pounded fighters from the fatah islam group entrenched in a palestinian refugee camp near the northern coastal city of tripoli , an afp photographer at the scene said . fatah islam has accused the government of trying to launch an offensive against palestinian camps in lebanon , which house more than half of the country 's nearly 400,000 refugees .
the fighting has killed 55 people dead and renewed fears about lebanon 's stability .
it is the worst explosion of violence - excluding warfare with israel - since the 1975-1990 civil war .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .
language seen as key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant kids tend to do worse in german schools many of the group 's members say that not speaking german , or not speaking it well , is one of the biggest problems for turkish immigrants and their children .
others say the educational system is too rigid and makes it hard for immigrant children to integrate themselves into german society .
taha baskan , a 21-year-old , said the language tests to become a german citizen were too difficult and that , in general , the hurdles to becoming german were too high .
" the citizenship laws should be relaxed to encourage integration , because one of the clearest signs of that is having a german passport , " he said .

representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .

a group of young turkish-germans are trying to dispel those stereotypes . " it 's important to us to promote a more positive picture of turkish people in society , " said 17-year-old ramia özal , a member of the " deukische generation , " whose name is composed from a mix of the words deutsch -lrb- german -rrb- and turkish .
" and that 's why we 've decided to set up this association . "
the deukische generation has around 100 members , 30 of whom are very active .
though most of the members are turkish between the ages of 15 and 30 , more and more german youth are showing an interest in them , the group said .
they plan to run television commercials that play with stereotypes as well as organize a fair to help parents whose german skills are poor to register their kids for sports and music clubs , something they might otherwise have difficulty doing .

afghanistan is a place where more of the prominent countries can unite against terrorism without the universal condemnation that is prevalent in iraq .
the fight against terrorism in afghanistan , especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , had the whole world singing from the same page until the us took the fight to iraq .
germany has a good , strong and competent military .
although germany and the us have many differences of opinion , especially nowadays , the german military can be a strong complement to the overall effort in afghanistan . - dennis mcclure , us germans should not enlarge their involvement in afghanistan simply because there is no rationale for taming the afghans using foreign military force , as history clearly proves .
you ca n't justify military intervention simply to teach others some hogwash about democracy when the purpose of this is not transparent .

germany needs to assist in the direct combat with the taliban .
how can you expect to win a war if your army does not fight ?

it 's time germany was seen by the world as the good guy , ready to fight for a righteous cause . - peter , australia this may be the one place in the world where nato can make a difference .
so much of this " war on terror " is a path of self destruction .
if in the end we can improve life for the afghan people , then this might be a good thing .
but i do n't know if nato should stay there forever . - lee davis , oregon , us german troops should not have been sent abroad anywhere .
i followed the english speaking press all the years of the war against terror and our allies are not even aware of german involvement .
let the " real soldiers , " namely the us , britain and australia , get on with their war by themselves . - hermann buhler , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide attack renews concerns over afghanistan mission a suicide attack by the taliban , which killed three german soldiers and injured five others , has brought renewed calls from the left for the government to rethink the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .

during previous visits with senior chinese officials , the german president was widely credited with cultivating friendly ties and criticizing human rights abuses all at once . köhler is expected to strike a similar balance this week in vietnam , where he is meeting with the socialist nation 's top three officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , left , met with minh triet on monday the german president , who holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties , was met by vietnamese president nguyen minh triet in hanoi on monday , and is set set to hold talks with prime minister nguyen tan dung and nong duc manh , the general secretary of the communist party . minh triet , tan dung and duc manh are among vietnam 's most influential leaders .
they are regarded as advocates of a moderate reform policy , and have furthered vietnam 's transition from a state-managed to an open market economy . " we , as well as the foreign investors , are reaping considerable benefits " from these market reforms , vietnamese president nguyen minh triet said in an interview published monday in germany 's der spiegel news magazine . a shared cultural history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam joined the world trade organization in january with annual growth rates of about 7 percent , vietnam currently has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies .
only china is growing faster , with an average annual growth rate of almost 10 percent over the last 25 years . despite its unbridled growth , vietnam was still a relatively poor country in 2006 , with an annual gross domestic product of $ 3,300 -lrb- 2,454 euros -rrb- per capita and inflation rates around 7.5 percent , according to the economist .
but deep poverty - those living on under $ 1 a day - is in decline while the purchasing power of the public is on the rise . vietnam is also one of germany 's most important asian trading partners , and no other country in the european union has such close economic ties with vietnam .
president minh triet told der spiegel that his government " protects the interests of western investors , and that benefits them as much as it benefits us .

hotel staff members have been given english courses and are learning how to cater to international guests .
the region will be better equipped to receive international tourists .
we are very happy about all this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.05.2007 politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinema gets political again at the 2007 cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .
but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .

but political themes have taken center stage at this year 's 60th edition of the acclaimed cinematic competition . this year 's international film festival in cannes , france opened with a heavy dose of political imagery .
from hollywood star leonardo dicaprio to little-known romanian director cristian mungiu , non-fiction was the dominant format during the opening weekend of the cannes film festival . and of course , where there is political film-making , there is michael moore .
at cannes , the muckraking film-maker presented his latest documentary , " sicko , " which takes a harsh look at america 's private health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore won the palme d 'or in 2004 for his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " moore also took advantage of the media spotlight to lambaste his favorite target , the administration of us president george w. bush . " this is an administration that flouts the law , flouts the constitution , " moore told the afp news service as he criticized a us government probe into a trip he made to cuba in connection with his latest film . " the point was not to go to cuba , it was to go to american soil , to guantanamo bay and to take 9/11 rescue workers there to receive the same medical care given to the al-qaeda detainees , " he railed . in a theme that is common to all of his works , moore 's " sicko " also depicts us politicians - bush above all , but others as well - as having been bought off by big business .
the film celebrates what it calls the " socialist " model that provides effective state health care in other western countries such as germany , and laments the fact that the united states has rejected this model . " titanic " star joins green bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonardo dicaprio : who needs a palme d 'or when you 've got a golden globe ?
meanwhile , hollywood movie star leonardo dicaprio screened " the 11th hour , " an environmental documentary he produced . but the film disappointed critics who were expecting a film similar to " an inconvenient truth , " the acclaimed documentary that was fronted by al gore and presented at cannes last year . neither michael moore nor leonardo dicaprio are competing for the palme d 'or , or golden palm , this year . after the screening of his film , dicaprio , who became famous for his lead role in the hit movie " titanic , " talked to reporters about environmental issues . the superstar reacted with indignation over suggestions that his green commitments were hypocritical in light of his own grandiose lifestyle . asked whether he had taken a fuel-guzzling flight on his way to the french rivieria , dicaprio was sarcastic .
" no , i took a train across the atlantic , " he quipped , adding : " we 're all trying the best we can , truly , we really are . " the " titanic " star 's sensitivity can be traced back to 2000 , when environmental activists claimed his film " the beach " damaged part of a thai national park during shooting . two years ago , dicaprio bought blackadore caye , an island off the coast of belize in central america , with the aim of building an eco-friendly resort . " fear cancels out freedom " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the cannes film palace , set in the beautiful french riviera other contenders also covered a wide range of international issues in their films . in " four months , three weeks and two days , " director cristian mungiu examines the horrific events surrounding an illegal abortion in romania under the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu . the film takes a look at feminism under communism , and director mungiu says the message was simple : " fear cancels out freedom . "
she said that the legalization of abortion after the fall of the iron curtain was seen as " the ultimate freedom " by romanian women . and in raphael nadjari 's " tehilim , " a family drama in jerusalem at first seems markedly apolitical .
but , little by little , the french film-maker introduces the viewer to a world that is " stuck between modernity and tradition , between spirituality and pragmatism , a world where a father figure - maybe a representation of god - is missing , " according to afp . the cannes festival ends next week , and the socio-political themes are expected to continue throughout . on wednesday , an exiled iranian living in paris , marjane satrapi , will show " persepolis , " an animated movie that purports to expose religious repression in the director 's homeland .

löscher is currently president of the global human health division at merck co . , the new jersey spin-off of the original german pharmaceutical , which ranks as the third largest drugmaker in the united states . löscher is a graduate of the harvard business school and has held numerous senior management positions in the healthcare field , including germany 's hoechst which merged with french pharmaceutical rhone-poulenc to become sanofi-aventis and general electric 's amersham in the uk , which competed against the medical devices unit at siemens . although siemens is europe 's largest producer of medical diagnostics and its health-care division accounts for about 12 percent of the company 's total turnover , löscher would be presiding over a giant conglomerate , which manufactures far more - everything from household appliances to gas turbines and high-speed trains . siemens ag is the largest listed company on the dax with a market capitalization of about 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- and employs some 487,000 people worldwide . in comparison löscher oversees 35,000 employees at merck , and has never been a top executive of any company before . löscher not part of germany inc . 's old-boy network however analysts say he has inspired investor confidence as an outsider , the first time ever that the head of siemens is not an internal candidate who has risen up through the ranks .
" löscher 's appointment is certainly a cultural shock for siemens , but a clean break was absolutely necessary , " jürgen kurz , spokesman for the german shareholder 's association -lrb- dsw -rrb- told dw-world.de. " kleinfeld 's replacement had to be an outsider , otherwise there 's always the fear lurking in the background that some other corruption charge could rise to the surface . "
kurz added that pressure from the us securities and exchange commission meant that siemens , which has been listed on the nyse since 2001 , needed to emerge squeaky clean from bribery charges for overseas contracts in the order of 420 million euros .
as an austrian , whose global career has meant postings in the us , spain , the uk and japan , löscher has never assumed a leadership role in any german blue chip company , added kurz .
" so he 's not tainted by the old-boy network that is germany , inc . , " he said .
predecessors performed well , but were tainted by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo kleinfeld lost the board 's confidence that löscher will be assuming the top job on july 1 , at a time of record profits , is an added advantage .
the entire group 's operating profits rose to nearly 2 billion euros for the first six months ending march 31 , which is about 50 percent more than over the same period last year , according to marc langendorf , financial spokesman for siemens ag .
langendorf dismissed concerns that löscher does not possess the breadth of experience in other industrial sectors .
" as the head of a conglomerate , he does n't need specialized knowledge in all fields , " said langendorf .
" his job as an experienced global manager is to steer the entire siemens group .
look at wolfgang reitzle .
he came from the auto industry and had no experience in the industrial gas sector when he joined linde .
but he 's done a good job there . "
other analysts have said that löscher has plenty of homework cut out for him .
" siemens is a highly complex conglomerate .
it would take a good six to 12 months to figure out what half the divisions do , " said ben uglow , an analyst at morgan stanley in london .
the choice of löscher as an " unimpeachable candidate , " uglow added , took precedence over the stellar performances of kleinfeld and von pierer , who - guilty or not - were tarnished by slush fund scandals that took place during their tenure .
uglow conclude that the jury is still out on löscher .
" at the end of the day , it boils down to the individual , " he said .

it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .

bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .

a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 21.05.2007 scope of human trafficking remains largely unknown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is sure exactly how many people are victims of human trafficking the mammoth proportions of human trafficking make combating it difficult .
representatives of ngos and osce governments continue the fight at a vienna meeting on monday . " we operate in an information fog , " antonio maria costa , director of the un office on drugs and crime , told reporters last month .
" we do n't know the scope of threats we face and ca n't gauge global trends .
we just see the tips of icebergs . "
it 's a fog that the organization for security and cooperation in europe is hoping it will be able to at least partially lift with a conference monday focusing on collection and reporting methods for victims of human trafficking .
" it 's very difficult to solve a problem when you do n't know how big it is , " said blanca tapia , a spokeswoman for the osce 's office to combat trafficking in human beings .
" all the countermeasures are going to be wrong if you do n't know what you are facing . "
estimates vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are not always trained to recognize victims the united nations estimates that there are as many as 2.5 million victims of trafficking or forced labor ; the international labor organization placed its worldwide estimate at 12.3 million in 2005 ; and the international organization of migration put the number of victims in 2001 at 400,000 .
the breadth of the problem makes it difficult for legislators and law enforcement to deal with it effectively , especially since the authorities who come into contact with forced laborers are not always trained to recognize it or given guidelines on how to handle victims .
" when the police raid a brothel , they check identification cards .
but the people have usually had their passports and documentation taken away from them , so the police say they are illegal immigrants who have to leave the country , " tapia said .
" instead of being the victim , they become the bad person who is thrown into jail . "
beyond the sex trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most estimates say half the victims of human trafficking are forced to work in the sex trade western europeans frequently believe the crime of human trafficking does not affect their countries , tapia said .
bundling together trafficking victims and illegal immigrants often shields them from the scope of the problem .
" some european countries cover the problem of human trafficking in illegal immigration , " she said .
" they say the people entered the country illegally , and too bad if they got the worst jobs and end up in slavery conditions . "
while many connect trafficking with forced prostitution , the osce and international rights organizations estimate that the sex trade accounts for 50 percent of victims .
the remaining 50 percent are forced into working for minimal or no compensation in a variety of fields , including agricultural and construction work , sweatshop labor and as domestic caregivers .
cutting demand instead of focusing their efforts on finding victims , who are often reluctant to speak with police out of fear that they or their families could be endangered if they supply information about their situation , tapia said the osce would focus on limiting demand for slave and enforced laborers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said only 2.8 percent of eu businesses are inspected for employing illegal workers one move that would help constrain demand would be added inspections of businesses , according to european union justice commissioner franco frattini .
he called on eu members to increase the number of businesses inspected for employing illegal migrants from 2 percent to 10 percent .
" very often we note slavery-like working conditions , workers are exploited , they are underpaid and they live in very poor and desperate conditions in eu territory , " he said .
" we can no longer tolerate this situation . "
lower prices through slave labor frattini estimated that as much as 16 percent of business in the eu is done off the books and said eu member states needed to institute hefty fines and jail sentences in serious cases to combat illegal worker exploitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini called for stiffer penalties for human trafficking and forced labor with close links to organized crime , the worldwide market for trade in humans is between $ 30 billion and $ 40 billion , according to antonio maria costa , executive director of the un office of drug and crime .
a supply of cheap labor provided by trafficking and forced labor often amounts to lower prices for the consumer and higher profits for companies , tapia said .
" we would not be getting very cheap strawberries or other foods we are getting right now if the wages for the people who are actually doing the work were higher , " she said .
" this is a big industry and a lot of money is made .

pele is the best-known player to have surpassed 1,000 goals but the record is also claimed by a number of others .
romario , 41 , admits his tally includes youth , friendly and testimonial games .
romario 's 1,000th goal came from a penalty kick in the game between vasco da gama and sport of recife in the brazilian national championship .
the fact that it was a penalty did not diminish the joy of his team-mates and the player was immediately mobbed .
surrounded by television crews , romario dedicated the goal to his family and children and said it marked an extraordinary moment in his life .
his wife and children were among those who came onto the pitch and it took 16 minutes before the game could be restarted .
despite the hype , there is controversy surrounding the achievement as romario 's tally is not recognised by football 's international governing body , fifa , which says it only counts goals scored in official tournaments .
however , given his long and highly successful career , there will be few who begrudge the player his night of glory .

bbc wales 's eye on wales programme surveyed the 22 councils ' plans .
it found that some councils believed a bi-weekly collection was the best way to get householders to reduce waste and meet recycling targets by 2010 .
but a campaigner for weekly collections said a fortnightly service was " not the best way forward " .
the programme found that half of wales 's 22 authorities were planning to continue with weekly collections .
of the other 11 , three had already switched to fortnightly , four were currently switching their schemes and another four were considering changing their collections .
have your say some people have already started to take exception and rather than keep the smelly stuff in their yard it now makes its way up to the local lanes which used to be a lovely quiet little walk .
andrew lindop , connahs quay your views on scrapping weekly bin collections currently , around 200 local authorities in the uk are collecting refuse fortnightly .
councils are aiming to hit welsh assembly government targets for 40 % of waste to be recycled by 2010 .
the spokesperson for the environment at the welsh local government association and gwynedd council leader , richard parry hughes , said that refuse collection was an issue .
" this is a huge problem and a huge challenge for all local authorities , and all local authorities are planning to avoid the fines , " he said .
" the political pressure is coming from householders themselves wanting to get rid of their waste and the financial pressure is coming from the eu whether they are going to charge us £ 200 a ton for putting into landfill .
some councils are considering fortnightly collections " therefore we have to work hard here to get the best answers for everybody .
" we ca n't afford not to hit those 2010 targets . "
but some householders have begun to campaign against fortnightly collections .
one campaigner , doretta cocks , said : " this is just not the best way and so many reports are coming forward saying that this is not a good idea from real experts in the field and these reports are being ignored .
" we are in the 21st century and i really do n't think that people should be putting up with that now . "
environmental group , friends of the earth cymru , has called for a " bin tax " where householders pay for the amount of waste they dispose of .
" we do think that there is a case for looking at a bin tax , a lot of people really do just want to take their waste removal for granted , " director julian rosser said .
" the situation is so serious that if in three four years time all the recycling provisions are in place and people are still are n't using them , then i think we are going to have to start taking action against them for what is effectively anti-social behaviour . "

ireland has seen a transformation over the past 10 years on a scale previous generations could never have predicted .
an unprecedented and sustained economic boom has significantly , and perhaps permanently , altered the irish people 's lifestyles and attitudes .
" we 're rebelling against previous generations , " says cora venus lunny , 25 , who is part of a new wave of young experimental irish musicians .
" opportunities in this country have changed and as a result priorities have changed .
" we used to want stability , but now we 're willing to take more risks . "
this willingness has been helped in no small part by increased wealth and prosperity , which have become central to modern society in the so-called celtic tiger economy .
a drive along many of the country 's main roads highlights this , as huge houses and vast estates now populate much of the previously sparse landscape .
many of the cars on the road before or behind you are also noticeably bigger , faster and more expensive .
but has this prosperity come at a price ?
" we 've definitely sacrificed something for wealth , but it 's hard to say exactly what , " says ms lunny .
impact on communities one clue could be found in some of the more traditional sectors of irish society .
agriculture , for example , was previously the backbone of the irish economy .
however , with the technology-driven boom taking place mainly in urban areas , rural industry - and therefore rural communities - have suffered . "
people have more choices now and rural communities have suffered as a result " farmer frank o 'mahony irish election : your comments cork farmer frank o 'mahony , 30 , inherited his dairy farm from his father and runs the 100-acre business by himself .
he was the only one of eight children to remain in farming .
" there are less and less farmers now and many are worried that the industry could be wiped out altogether , " he says .
" the agricultural lobby was diminished by the celtic tiger and , in this election year , farmers are n't as big a vote as they used to be .
" most farmers in ireland are over the age of 55 and more than half of them do n't have an obvious successor .
" that 's a real worry for the farming community .
people have more choices now and rural communities have suffered as a result . "
isolation " it 's certainly a changing time for agriculture , " says catherine buckley , 29 , who was recently voted the first woman president of macra na feirme , a youth organisation whose membership is mostly from rural areas .
" agriculture used to be at the heart of irish communities .
now people working in the industry must make a conscious effort to go out and get involved in their communities . "
the term " cash rich , time poor " is one that is used by many in ireland to describe the change in people 's work-life balance .
and many feel this has affected how communities interact .
" isolation can be a big problem , " says ms buckley .
" previously in this country people would always traditionally say ' hello ' to each other in the street .
" now people may not know who their neighbour is and that sense of community has been diminished .
you can feel isolated anywhere now . "
that fear of isolation is particularly acute for the elderly .
pensioner eamon o 'connell , 71 , from edenderry , county offaly , has been living alone since his wife died almost a year ago .
" you do worry , if you got sick or had a heart attack , whether anyone would be able to help , " he says .
" ireland is n't a bad country in which to be elderly overall , but it 's very worrying now to be alone .
it 's been a disastrous feeling for me over the past few months . "
positive change ?
returning emigrants perhaps notice the changes more than most , many having left the country in the 1970s , 80s or 90s when there were few jobs and even fewer prospects for school-leavers and graduates .
one returned emigrant , nuala weber , left ireland and headed for mexico in 1993 .
she moved back to dublin last year and has mixed feelings about ireland 's prosperity .
" looking back on before , there was such huge unemployment here .
when i was in college i could n't even get a summer job , " she says .
" it 's been a big change coming back , especially having lived in a country like mexico , where so many people survive on very little .
" here the houses are enormous and there 's so much traffic but not much ecological awareness .
plus , you ca n't just ask anyone for directions anymore , since there are so many new immigrants .
" it should be a good thing that ireland has this newfound prosperity , but i 'm really angry that there 's so much money in the country and we ca n't seem to recycle , or keep galway 's water supply clean -lsb- ireland 's third-biggest city is currently suffering from an outbreak of the parasite cryptosporidium in its water supply -rsb- .
" that does n't seem like a very progressive country to me . "

cora venus lunny says irish people now have different priorities ireland has seen a transformation over the past 10 years on a scale previous generations could never have predicted .
an unprecedented and sustained economic boom has significantly , and perhaps permanently , altered the irish people 's lifestyles and attitudes .
" we 're rebelling against previous generations , " says cora venus lunny , 25 , who is part of a new wave of young experimental irish musicians .
" opportunities in this country have changed and as a result priorities have changed .
" we used to want stability , but now we 're willing to take more risks . "
this willingness has been helped in no small part by increased wealth and prosperity , which have become central to modern society in the so-called celtic tiger economy .
modernity and history are equally visible on ireland 's streets a drive along many of the country 's main roads highlights this , as huge houses and vast estates now populate much of the previously sparse landscape .
many of the cars on the road before or behind you are also noticeably bigger , faster and more expensive .
but has this prosperity come at a price ?
" we 've definitely sacrificed something for wealth , but it 's hard to say exactly what , " says ms lunny .
impact on communities one clue could be found in some of the more traditional sectors of irish society .
agriculture , for example , was previously the backbone of the irish economy .
however , with the technology-driven boom taking place mainly in urban areas , rural industry - and therefore rural communities - have suffered .

" there are less and less farmers now and many are worried that the industry could be wiped out altogether , " he says .
" the agricultural lobby was diminished by the celtic tiger and , in this election year , farmers are n't as big a vote as they used to be .
" most farmers in ireland are over the age of 55 and more than half of them do n't have an obvious successor .

cora venus lunny says irish people now have different priorities ireland has seen a transformation over the past 10 years on a scale previous generations could never have predicted .
an unprecedented and sustained economic boom has significantly , and perhaps permanently , altered the irish people 's lifestyles and attitudes .
" we 're rebelling against previous generations , " says cora venus lunny , 25 , who is part of a new wave of young experimental irish musicians .
" opportunities in this country have changed and as a result priorities have changed .
" we used to want stability , but now we 're willing to take more risks . "
this willingness has been helped in no small part by increased wealth and prosperity , which have become central to modern society in the so-called celtic tiger economy .
modernity and history are equally visible on ireland 's streets a drive along many of the country 's main roads highlights this , as huge houses and vast estates now populate much of the previously sparse landscape .
many of the cars on the road before or behind you are also noticeably bigger , faster and more expensive .
but has this prosperity come at a price ?
" we 've definitely sacrificed something for wealth , but it 's hard to say exactly what , " says ms lunny .
impact on communities one clue could be found in some of the more traditional sectors of irish society .
agriculture , for example , was previously the backbone of the irish economy .
however , with the technology-driven boom taking place mainly in urban areas , rural industry - and therefore rural communities - have suffered .
people have more choices now and rural communities have suffered as a result farmer frank o 'mahony irish election : your comments cork farmer frank o 'mahony , 30 , inherited his dairy farm from his father and runs the 100-acre business by himself .
he was the only one of eight children to remain in farming .
" there are less and less farmers now and many are worried that the industry could be wiped out altogether , " he says .
" the agricultural lobby was diminished by the celtic tiger and , in this election year , farmers are n't as big a vote as they used to be .
" most farmers in ireland are over the age of 55 and more than half of them do n't have an obvious successor .
" that 's a real worry for the farming community .
people have more choices now and rural communities have suffered as a result . "
isolation " it 's certainly a changing time for agriculture , " says catherine buckley , 29 , who was recently voted the first woman president of macra na feirme , a youth organisation whose membership is mostly from rural areas .
" agriculture used to be at the heart of irish communities .
now people working in the industry must make a conscious effort to go out and get involved in their communities . "
the term " cash rich , time poor " is one that is used by many in ireland to describe the change in people 's work-life balance .
and many feel this has affected how communities interact .
pensioner eamon o ' connell says being alone is " disastrous " " isolation can be a big problem , " says ms buckley .
" previously in this country people would always traditionally say ' hello ' to each other in the street .
" now people may not know who their neighbour is and that sense of community has been diminished .
you can feel isolated anywhere now . "
that fear of isolation is particularly acute for the elderly .
pensioner eamon o 'connell , 71 , from edenderry , county offaly , has been living alone since his wife died almost a year ago .
" you do worry , if you got sick or had a heart attack , whether anyone would be able to help , " he says .
" ireland is n't a bad country in which to be elderly overall , but it 's very worrying now to be alone .
it 's been a disastrous feeling for me over the past few months . "
positive change ?
returning emigrants perhaps notice the changes more than most , many having left the country in the 1970s , 80s or 90s when there were few jobs and even fewer prospects for school-leavers and graduates .
nuala weber is critical of some aspects of the new ireland one returned emigrant , nuala weber , left ireland and headed for mexico in 1993 .
she moved back to dublin last year and has mixed feelings about ireland 's prosperity .
" looking back on before , there was such huge unemployment here .
when i was in college i could n't even get a summer job , " she says .
" it 's been a big change coming back , especially having lived in a country like mexico , where so many people survive on very little .
" here the houses are enormous and there 's so much traffic but not much ecological awareness .
plus , you ca n't just ask anyone for directions anymore , since there are so many new immigrants .
" it should be a good thing that ireland has this newfound prosperity , but i 'm really angry that there 's so much money in the country and we ca n't seem to recycle , or keep galway 's water supply clean -lsb- ireland 's third-biggest city is currently suffering from an outbreak of the parasite cryptosporidium in its water supply -rsb- .
" that does n't seem like a very progressive country to me . "

under the £ 3.5bn plan , the company aims to open about 40 new hotels each year until 2020 .
by the end of the expansion programme the group plans to have grabbed a 10 % slice of the uk hotel market , taking in 20 million customers a year .
travelodge will concentrate its programme in the greater london area as well as in wales and scotland .
the group said it had made the decision to expand as it believes the uk market is ripe for a revival .
" there is no doubt that the uk hotel industry will see a major phase of regeneration over the next decade , " travelodge 's property director , paul harvey , said .
" the mid-market hotels are suffering from a severe identity crisis as they no longer offer real value to the customer " .
the travelodge group , which operates 291 hotels in the uk , ireland and spain , was bought by dubai international capital in a £ 675m private equity deal last year .
at the time the dubai-based firm said it planned to make the group the uk 's leading budget hotel operator by the 2012 olympics .

travelodge will concentrate its programme in the greater london area as well as in wales and scotland .
the group said it had made the decision to expand as it believes the uk market is ripe for a revival .
" there is no doubt that the uk hotel industry will see a major phase of regeneration over the next decade , " travelodge 's property director , paul harvey , said .
" the mid-market hotels are suffering from a severe identity crisis as they no longer offer real value to the customer " .
the travelodge group , which operates 291 hotels in the uk , ireland and spain , was bought by dubai international capital in a £ 675m private equity deal last year .
at the time the dubai-based firm said it planned to make the group the uk 's leading budget hotel operator by the 2012 olympics .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- scotland -pipe- south of scotland -pipe- msps ' against ' new nuclear power bbc news / south of scotland graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine monday , 21 may 2007 , 07:58 gmt 08:58 uk msps ' against ' new nuclear power the issue of nuclear power could create a political clash between mps and msps this week .
most of the scottish parliament is opposed to nuclear power , according to a survey by environmental pressure group friends of the earth scotland .
however , the uk government is expected to promote new nuclear stations in a white paper at westminster .
the survey found 72 of the 99 new msps who responded opposed building new nuclear power stations in scotland .
it found 24 supported new nuclear and three were undecided .
thirty msps did not respond .
' white elephant ' first minister alex salmond has insisted there is no prospect of new nuclear stations in scotland .
he told the bbc 's politics show : " as far as scotland is concerned , i think we 'll be saying : ' nuclear power - no thanks ' .
" there 's absolutely no chance of us allowing a new generation of nuclear power in scotland .
" there is just no consensus in scottish society or in the scottish parliament to have foisted on us another generation of nuclear power stations . "
trade and industry secretary alistair darling told the same programme : " i certainly started off as a sceptic , as far as nuclear was concerned .
" but i think that if we do n't keep that open as an option , then we 're not going to be able to reach our targets to reduce the amount of carbon going in to the atmosphere , and we have run a grave risk of not having our electricity when we need it . "
friends of the earth scotland 's chief executive duncan mclaren said the demolition of the cooling towers at the chapelcross plant at the weekend should mark the end for nuclear power in scotland .
he said : " the closure and clean-up of chapelcross should intensify our drive for increased energy efficiency and clean renewables , not a return to polluting and expensive nuclear .
" the results of our survey could n't be clearer - new nuclear power stations are not welcome in scotland .
like the public , the majority of msps realise that nuclear power is nothing other than a white elephant .
" any attempt to foist new nuclear power on scotland would be an expensive , ineffective and risky distraction from sensible measures to address climate change . "
energy gap chapelcross nuclear plant in dumfries and galloway is being decommissioned after operating for almost half a century .
more than a third of the electricity generated in scotland comes from its two remaining nuclear power stations .
torness in east lothian is expected to stay open until 2023 .
hunterston b in ayrshire is due to close in 2011 but could be kept open for a further decade to plug the energy gap .
it has just been switched back on after a 10-month shutdown because of defects in its boilers .

' white elephant ' first minister alex salmond has insisted there is no prospect of new nuclear stations in scotland .
he told the bbc 's politics show : " as far as scotland is concerned , i think we 'll be saying : ' nuclear power - no thanks ' .
" there 's absolutely no chance of us allowing a new generation of nuclear power in scotland .

" the results of our survey could n't be clearer - new nuclear power stations are not welcome in scotland .

the " celtic tiger " economy has achieved almost mythical status .
ireland 's fortunes have been transformed , and the rest of the world has sat up and watched with interest .
unsurprisingly , many countries have flown delegations to dublin to find out how it has been done .
and ireland , a place renowned for the warmth of its welcome , has opened the door to those inquisitive visitors .
one government official recounts the story of how officials from the baltic states still refer back to a trip they made in 2004 with great fondness .
the current foreign minister , dermot ahern , took a group of them for a night out at the greyhound racing in dundalk , something they had not done before , and they loved it .
from all around the world they come - politicians , students , academics , business and union leaders .
in recent weeks , a brazilian delegation has come to see the irish economy for itself , and executive mba students from an ivy league college in the us have come to compare ireland with other eu states .
so the path to dublin is very well trodden , especially by groups from countries whose economies are growing rapidly , or who dream of emulating irish success .
around the time of eu enlargement in 2004 , when ireland also held the eu presidency , there was much focus on what the new accession states in eastern europe might learn from the " irish model " .
how do they do it ?
the usual schedule for such visitors to the emerald isle includes trips to meet government officials in the capital , to companies in the city and beyond , and sessions with unions and academics at universities and think-tanks . "
prior to the growth of the past 10 or 15 years , ireland 's economy was known more for its failures " irish election : your views so what do they want to know ?
david croughan is chief economist at the irish business and employers confederation , and he estimates that his organisation deals with dozens of such visits every year .
he said : " essentially it 's to do with how all this has come about - how ireland has had such rapid growth in the past decade or so . "
and what answers are they given once they are here ?
" a lot of it was a catch-up process , " says david croughan .
" partly that was due to inappropriate policies in the past , and everything came to a crisis in the mid to late 1980s .
" the partnership process was born out of that - government , employers , unions and farmers came together with a common goal of trying to solve an unsustainable situation . "
past failures prior to the growth of the past 10 or 15 years , ireland 's economy was known more for its failures : high unemployment , high emigration , and the loss of skills that produced public debts and a general malaise .
the " partnership process " between the various parties is credited by some as helping to create a stable platform for economic growth .
other ingredients which foreign visitors hear about include government policy , support from the eu , and the importance of a young , well-educated , english-speaking population .
foreign direct investment , especially from the united states , has provided a catalyst .
imitation is flattery other smaller nations have also noted ireland 's tax policies with great interest .
corporation tax , at 12.5 % , is low here by comparison with the rest of europe .
income tax rates have been cut since the hard times of the 1980s .
it is not only ireland 's economic success which has been the subject of scrutiny by the outside world .
when i was reporting on the smoking ban , i filmed a group of swedish civil servants who had come over to dublin to learn lessons from the introduction of the smoking ban here .
at the time , in 2004 , many outside observers had wondered how a country with such a strong pub culture could even consider bringing in such a ban .
but at a smart hotel in dublin city centre , an irish official described how the new legislation had been brought in , as the swedes took notes .
ahead of scotland 's smoking ban , the then first minister jack mcconnell also came to have a close-up look at the irish experience .
in a similar vein , the uk government has looked hard at ireland 's introduction of a plastic bag levy , widely viewed as an environmental success here .
if imitation is indeed a form of flattery , then sending a fact-finding group to ireland probably comes into the same category .
the heat of the irish economy may have cooled a little , but dublin airport wo n't be rolling away its red carpet just yet .

the " celtic tiger " economy has achieved almost mythical status .
ireland 's fortunes have been transformed , and the rest of the world has sat up and watched with interest .
unsurprisingly , many countries have flown delegations to dublin to find out how it has been done .
and ireland , a place renowned for the warmth of its welcome , has opened the door to those inquisitive visitors .
one government official recounts the story of how officials from the baltic states still refer back to a trip they made in 2004 with great fondness .
the current foreign minister , dermot ahern , took a group of them for a night out at the greyhound racing in dundalk , something they had not done before , and they loved it .
from all around the world they come - politicians , students , academics , business and union leaders .
in recent weeks , a brazilian delegation has come to see the irish economy for itself , and executive mba students from an ivy league college in the us have come to compare ireland with other eu states .
so the path to dublin is very well trodden , especially by groups from countries whose economies are growing rapidly , or who dream of emulating irish success .
around the time of eu enlargement in 2004 , when ireland also held the eu presidency , there was much focus on what the new accession states in eastern europe might learn from the " irish model " .
how do they do it ?
the usual schedule for such visitors to the emerald isle includes trips to meet government officials in the capital , to companies in the city and beyond , and sessions with unions and academics at universities and think-tanks .
prior to the growth of the past 10 or 15 years , ireland 's economy was known more for its failures irish election : your views so what do they want to know ?
david croughan is chief economist at the irish business and employers confederation , and he estimates that his organisation deals with dozens of such visits every year .
he said : " essentially it 's to do with how all this has come about - how ireland has had such rapid growth in the past decade or so . "
and what answers are they given once they are here ?
" a lot of it was a catch-up process , " says david croughan .
" partly that was due to inappropriate policies in the past , and everything came to a crisis in the mid to late 1980s .
" the partnership process was born out of that - government , employers , unions and farmers came together with a common goal of trying to solve an unsustainable situation . "
past failures prior to the growth of the past 10 or 15 years , ireland 's economy was known more for its failures : high unemployment , high emigration , and the loss of skills that produced public debts and a general malaise .
ireland 's financial success has spurred transport growth the " partnership process " between the various parties is credited by some as helping to create a stable platform for economic growth .
other ingredients which foreign visitors hear about include government policy , support from the eu , and the importance of a young , well-educated , english-speaking population .
foreign direct investment , especially from the united states , has provided a catalyst .
imitation is flattery other smaller nations have also noted ireland 's tax policies with great interest .
corporation tax , at 12.5 % , is low here by comparison with the rest of europe .
income tax rates have been cut since the hard times of the 1980s .
it is not only ireland 's economic success which has been the subject of scrutiny by the outside world .
when i was reporting on the smoking ban , i filmed a group of swedish civil servants who had come over to dublin to learn lessons from the introduction of the smoking ban here .
at the time , in 2004 , many outside observers had wondered how a country with such a strong pub culture could even consider bringing in such a ban .
but at a smart hotel in dublin city centre , an irish official described how the new legislation had been brought in , as the swedes took notes .
ahead of scotland 's smoking ban , the then first minister jack mcconnell also came to have a close-up look at the irish experience .
in a similar vein , the uk government has looked hard at ireland 's introduction of a plastic bag levy , widely viewed as an environmental success here .
if imitation is indeed a form of flattery , then sending a fact-finding group to ireland probably comes into the same category .
the heat of the irish economy may have cooled a little , but dublin airport wo n't be rolling away its red carpet just yet .
