program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 01.03.2007 claims that clergy spied for communists upset polish readers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop stanislaw wielgus resigned over accusations of involvement with the polish secret police a controversial book exploring the link between poland ’ s clergy and the secret police under communism has hit polish book stores .
some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .
he later made a public confession . some priests forced to spy in one of his rare interviews , father isakowicz zaleski explained the motivation behind his book .
using a quote from a poem he wrote , he said that , in a world full of people who do not respect christian values , it is his duty to come out with the truth to reach out to ordinary polish roman catholics . the church , he stressed , must confess and repent in order to heal old wounds . church sources admit that some 10 percent of polish priests were once involved in collaboration with the secret police , many of them having been coerced into serving the communist state . normalization will take time there have been few official reactions to the publication from polish church circles , apart from a statement by józef kloch , spokesman for the polish episcopate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church must confess and repent , said father isakowicz zaleski " one needs time to fully digest the facts contained in the book , " said kloch .
" if one acts hastily , one ends up with sensational media headlines based on randomly selected facts taken out of context , " he added . father adam boniecki , publisher of a liberal catholic weekly , said he believed the present crisis may be painful , but that it would eventually lead to a more normal relationship between the church and its followers , based on a sound understanding of the past . some question political motives according to british catholic journalist bill foreman , who lives in warsaw , the book ’ s publication and the recent spy scandal involving archbishop wielgus have deepened divisions within the polish roman catholic community . while many ordinary polish roman catholics welcome the arrival of the book , some question the author ’ s motives as political .
critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .
he later made a public confession . some priests forced to spy in one of his rare interviews , father isakowicz zaleski explained the motivation behind his book .
using a quote from a poem he wrote , he said that , in a world full of people who do not respect christian values , it is his duty to come out with the truth to reach out to ordinary polish roman catholics . the church , he stressed , must confess and repent in order to heal old wounds . church sources admit that some 10 percent of polish priests were once involved in collaboration with the secret police , many of them having been coerced into serving the communist state . normalization will take time there have been few official reactions to the publication from polish church circles , apart from a statement by józef kloch , spokesman for the polish episcopate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church must confess and repent , said father isakowicz zaleski " one needs time to fully digest the facts contained in the book , " said kloch .
" if one acts hastily , one ends up with sensational media headlines based on randomly selected facts taken out of context , " he added . father adam boniecki , publisher of a liberal catholic weekly , said he believed the present crisis may be painful , but that it would eventually lead to a more normal relationship between the church and its followers , based on a sound understanding of the past . some question political motives according to british catholic journalist bill foreman , who lives in warsaw , the book ’ s publication and the recent spy scandal involving archbishop wielgus have deepened divisions within the polish roman catholic community . while many ordinary polish roman catholics welcome the arrival of the book , some question the author ’ s motives as political .
critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 01.03.2007 claims that clergy spied for communists upset polish readers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop stanislaw wielgus resigned over accusations of involvement with the polish secret police a controversial book exploring the link between poland ’ s clergy and the secret police under communism has hit polish book stores .
some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .
he later made a public confession . some priests forced to spy in one of his rare interviews , father isakowicz zaleski explained the motivation behind his book .
using a quote from a poem he wrote , he said that , in a world full of people who do not respect christian values , it is his duty to come out with the truth to reach out to ordinary polish roman catholics . the church , he stressed , must confess and repent in order to heal old wounds . church sources admit that some 10 percent of polish priests were once involved in collaboration with the secret police , many of them having been coerced into serving the communist state . normalization will take time there have been few official reactions to the publication from polish church circles , apart from a statement by józef kloch , spokesman for the polish episcopate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church must confess and repent , said father isakowicz zaleski " one needs time to fully digest the facts contained in the book , " said kloch .
" if one acts hastily , one ends up with sensational media headlines based on randomly selected facts taken out of context , " he added . father adam boniecki , publisher of a liberal catholic weekly , said he believed the present crisis may be painful , but that it would eventually lead to a more normal relationship between the church and its followers , based on a sound understanding of the past . some question political motives according to british catholic journalist bill foreman , who lives in warsaw , the book ’ s publication and the recent spy scandal involving archbishop wielgus have deepened divisions within the polish roman catholic community . while many ordinary polish roman catholics welcome the arrival of the book , some question the author ’ s motives as political .
critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo . in an interview with german tv program " monitor , " pierre-richard prosper , the us government 's former ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues until oct 2005 , said that german officials never contacted him about releasing kurnaz from the detention camp . " during my entire time in office , germany never showed any interest and i was the person to contact within the us government , " said prosper , who was responsible for returning guantanamo inmates to their home countries from 2002 to 2005 . german efforts to get kurnaz released ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz arriving at a parliamentary hearing in january kurnaz was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of being a terrorist and spent more than four years in detention before being released without charge from guantanamo in 2006 .
he says he was tortured and abused at the camp . german government officials have denied delaying the release of kurnaz , who has turkish citizenship , but grew up in germany .
the case is now under investigation by a parliamentary committee .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , has come under fire for his role . steinmeier has said that the schröder government repeatedly talked to us officials about the kurnaz case and lobbied for his release . pros per : kurnaz ready for release since 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosper -lrb- right -rrb- in 2005 but prosper , who left public service to work as an attorney at the beginning of the year , said he did n't know of any such conversations . " if the german government would have said : ' we want kurnaz , ' we would have immediately sat down to come to an agreement , " prosper said , according to german translations of the interview . prosper added that it was " not a secret " that kurnaz had been " considered for release " since 2002 . no us demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier " germany and turkey knew , or should have known , that the us was ready to talk about his release , " he said , adding that us officials were interested in reducing the number of guantanamo inmates drastically . prosper also said that us officials did not ask their german counterparts to use kurnaz as an intelligence contact in islamist groups in germany upon his release , as steinmeier has claimed . steinmeier has not commented on prosper 's statements .
he is expected to testify before the parliamentary committee on march 22 . documents withheld on thursday , the investigation by the parliamentary committee was held up as some official documents relating to murat kurnaz were delayed .
the papers are reportedly files from german domestic intelligence agency sources in bremen alleging that kurnaz had links to radical islamists . siegfried kauder , chairman of a parliament investigation committee , said he had requested the files from authorities in the northwestern city-state of bremen and had been assured weeks ago that they were on their way .
" as of today , they have not arrived at the secretariat of the committee , " the conservative politician said .

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .
" at octoshape we do n't have any animals , so it 's really not needed . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german man refuses to testify early in the morning what would you do if you were asked by the police to testify early in the morning ?

contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo . in an interview with german tv program " monitor , " pierre-richard prosper , the us government 's former ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues until oct 2005 , said that german officials never contacted him about releasing kurnaz from the detention camp . " during my entire time in office , germany never showed any interest and i was the person to contact within the us government , " said prosper , who was responsible for returning guantanamo inmates to their home countries from 2002 to 2005 . german efforts to get kurnaz released ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz arriving at a parliamentary hearing in january kurnaz was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of being a terrorist and spent more than four years in detention before being released without charge from guantanamo in 2006 .
he says he was tortured and abused at the camp . german government officials have denied delaying the release of kurnaz , who has turkish citizenship , but grew up in germany .
the case is now under investigation by a parliamentary committee .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , has come under fire for his role . steinmeier has said that the schröder government repeatedly talked to us officials about the kurnaz case and lobbied for his release . pros per : kurnaz ready for release since 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosper -lrb- right -rrb- in 2005 but prosper , who left public service to work as an attorney at the beginning of the year , said he did n't know of any such conversations . " if the german government would have said : ' we want kurnaz , ' we would have immediately sat down to come to an agreement , " prosper said , according to german translations of the interview . prosper added that it was " not a secret " that kurnaz had been " considered for release " since 2002 . no us demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier " germany and turkey knew , or should have known , that the us was ready to talk about his release , " he said , adding that us officials were interested in reducing the number of guantanamo inmates drastically . prosper also said that us officials did not ask their german counterparts to use kurnaz as an intelligence contact in islamist groups in germany upon his release , as steinmeier has claimed . steinmeier has not commented on prosper 's statements .
he is expected to testify before the parliamentary committee on march 22 . documents withheld on thursday , the investigation by the parliamentary committee was held up as some official documents relating to murat kurnaz were delayed .
the papers are reportedly files from german domestic intelligence agency sources in bremen alleging that kurnaz had links to radical islamists . siegfried kauder , chairman of a parliament investigation committee , said he had requested the files from authorities in the northwestern city-state of bremen and had been assured weeks ago that they were on their way .

the european union launched a new fundamental rights agency in vienna on thursday .
will it prove to be another bureaucratic toothless tiger , as critics wonder , or can the bureau effectively pack a punch ? asylum , anti-semitism , xenophobia , freedom of movement , data protection , discrimination - this is the to-do list for the european union 's new fundamental rights agency . the organization is there to do research , write reports and raise awareness .
legal action is out of the question . the best case scenario is that the agency will be attentive and offer helpful warnings and admonishments , said hannes tretter from the boltzmann institute for human rights in vienna .

" and that 's why it 's obvious that europe alone can not solve the climate problem . " merkel said it was time to act and urged government leaders to follow the recommendations of the european commission , which has called for a 20-percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 . she said the 27-member bloc needed to invest more in new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat the effects of climate change and emphasized that this was an opportunity to demonstrate leadership . " when we in europe can show that economics and ecology are compatible , then we will have demonstrated that we can combine technological leadership and innovation with our responsibility toward the rest of the world , " she said . reviving the constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch and the french said " no " to the eu constitution in 2005 merkel told parliament that germany planned to present a road map on how to proceed with the stalled eu constitution when its presidency of the european union expires at the end of june . eighteen of the 27 eu members have ratified the constitution , which french and dutch voters rejected in 2005 .
some countries , notably britain , have strong reservations about the constitution . " europe is our future , " she said , adding that problems such as environmental protection , illegal immigration , global trade and international security can not be resolved by individual states . achievements and goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto negotiations were revived last month merkel said that a summit in the german capital , which will take place in the last week of march to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding , would result in a berlin declaration , setting out past achievements and naming goals for the future . the german chancellor also vowed to push ahead with efforts to get a deal on world trade this year , saying that an agreement was urgent . " it is a priority for us to successfully reach a conclusion in the doha cycle and we are strongly committed to this , " merkel said .
" we are aware that the european union , and germany , the world 's biggest exporter , can benefit from this . " the wto negotiations , launched more than five years ago to boost commerce and reduce poverty were revived last month after being suspended last year , but there has been little visible progress so far . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu fundamental rights agency already dodging critics the european union launched a new fundamental rights agency in vienna on thursday .

contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo . in an interview with german tv program " monitor , " pierre-richard prosper , the us government 's former ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues until oct 2005 , said that german officials never contacted him about releasing kurnaz from the detention camp . " during my entire time in office , germany never showed any interest and i was the person to contact within the us government , " said prosper , who was responsible for returning guantanamo inmates to their home countries from 2002 to 2005 . german efforts to get kurnaz released ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz arriving at a parliamentary hearing in january kurnaz was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of being a terrorist and spent more than four years in detention before being released without charge from guantanamo in 2006 .
he says he was tortured and abused at the camp . german government officials have denied delaying the release of kurnaz , who has turkish citizenship , but grew up in germany .
the case is now under investigation by a parliamentary committee .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , has come under fire for his role . steinmeier has said that the schröder government repeatedly talked to us officials about the kurnaz case and lobbied for his release . pros per : kurnaz ready for release since 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosper -lrb- right -rrb- in 2005 but prosper , who left public service to work as an attorney at the beginning of the year , said he did n't know of any such conversations . " if the german government would have said : ' we want kurnaz , ' we would have immediately sat down to come to an agreement , " prosper said , according to german translations of the interview . prosper added that it was " not a secret " that kurnaz had been " considered for release " since 2002 . no us demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier " germany and turkey knew , or should have known , that the us was ready to talk about his release , " he said , adding that us officials were interested in reducing the number of guantanamo inmates drastically . prosper also said that us officials did not ask their german counterparts to use kurnaz as an intelligence contact in islamist groups in germany upon his release , as steinmeier has claimed . steinmeier has not commented on prosper 's statements .
he is expected to testify before the parliamentary committee on march 22 . documents withheld on thursday , the investigation by the parliamentary committee was held up as some official documents relating to murat kurnaz were delayed .
the papers are reportedly files from german domestic intelligence agency sources in bremen alleging that kurnaz had links to radical islamists . siegfried kauder , chairman of a parliament investigation committee , said he had requested the files from authorities in the northwestern city-state of bremen and had been assured weeks ago that they were on their way .
" as of today , they have not arrived at the secretariat of the committee , " the conservative politician said .
" in this situation , sensible work by the committee is impossible .

" we have a big advantage .
they need the parts we make but we do n't need management , " head of the works council in varel , jürgen bruns , said in a fiery speech . " praised !
betrayed !
sold ! " read the banners at the laupheim rally , referring to the bitterness many workers felt after airbus ' sunny outlook just two years ago clouded over setbacks with its a380 superjumbo jet programme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus workers are outraged by the restructuring bid airbus parent company eads triggered the protests with the announcement wednesday of its " power8 " rescue scheme to axe 10,000 jobs in germany , france , britain and spain and trim its factory network . on thursday , airbus also announced it had suspended development of the cargo version of its giant a380 superjumbo jet , but said it would continue looking for clients for the freight plane . three clients had placed orders for the airbus cargo superjumbo plane by november , but since then one has been scrapped and two others were also poised to be cancelled . " we are not stopping the program , " said an airbus spokesman .
" we are suspending development , but we will continue canvassing for business . " union anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-chief executive louis gallois germany 's powerful ig metall trade union for the engineering and metal-working industries vowed to fight the sale of airbus plants and protect german jobs with efforts to boost productivity and create more flexible work contracts . the head of the union 's northern chapter , jutta blankau , announced a european-wide protest movement against the restructuring plan . " we hope to mobilize employees across europe in the next 14 days , " blankau said .
" we have spoken with trade unions in the other countries " where airbus has plants . " " we oppose any sell-off or closure of a plant .
our slogan is if one is affected , all are affected , " she said . bildunterschrift : the head of the works council for the seven airbus plants in germany , rüdiger lütjens , said the decision to slash jobs and trim the network of plants in europe made little sense . " our orders list is full , which shows how popular our products are .
we do not understand why plants need to be sold , " he said . under the restructuring plans , two of the seven german sites - laupheim and varel - are to be sold , while an industrial partner will be sought for nordenham . political support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german airbus plant in varel is to be sold the northern state of lower saxony threw its weight behind the employees .
although he welcomed the plans in principle wednesday , state premier christian wulff promised thursday to fight job cuts in his state . " we reject airbus ' plans to abandon its plants , " he said . chancellor angela merkel said wednesday that germany could have been hit harder if it were not for her government 's efforts , in comments echoed by local leaders thursday . airbus plans to slash jobs across europe in the next four years , with 4,300 cuts in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain . originally , germany had feared that up to 8,000 of its jobs could be on the line .
airbus 's seven german sites currently employ a workforce of around 21,000 . a hot potato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus was the subject of a satirical float at the rose monday carnival parade in mainz the berlin daily der tagesspiegel said that airbus had become a political hot potato , overriding the powers of its chief executive louis gallois . " airbus is becoming an issue in the french election campaign , " it said in an editorial .
" an economically effective overhaul is impossible under these circumstances . " the munich-based newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , however , said it was wise for airbus to gird itself for tougher times . " it is good for the company to undergo a restructuring and cut costs now during an unprecedented boom in the aircraft manufacturing industry , " it said .

" contrary to what was the case in the past , we 're no longer excluding expanding abroad via acquisitions , particularly in mobile telephony , " obermann said . the chief executive refused to rule out large-scale acquisitions , as long as they made sense and fulfilled " strict financial criteria , " he said . targeting fast-growth markets quizzed about the possible takeover targets , obermann replied : " we 're very dependent on the german , european and us markets .
but we do n't have any substantial presence in fast-growing markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could telekom be looking for indian customers ?
deutsche telekom would therefore look in that direction , he said , while refusing to name any specific country . british mobile phone giant vodafone recently moved into the indian market by buying hutchison essar for more than $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.3 billion euros -rrb- .
deutsche telekom had looked ready to embark on a major shopping spree last year when it bought austrian mobile operator , tele.ring. but since then , it has had to focus on its own problems at home caused by ferocious price competition and a massive outflux of fixed-line customers . selling assets , finding partners deutsche telekom would create financial room for manoeuvre by selling off non-strategic assets , obermann said .
up for sale were french and spanish internet access providers club internet and ya.com , as well as the t-systems media and broadcast unit , a service provider for the broadcasting and media industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom needs some cash first asked about the amount of money such divestments could raise , finance chief karl-gerhard eick said that " three billion euros could be feasible in a relatively short term . "
but the sum " could be more , " he said . the group said it also planned to sell its radio towers in germany and the united states , and the remaining shares in real estate company sireo . obermann said deutsche telekom was also on the look-out for a strategic partner for its information and communications technology unit , t-systems .
press reports have repeatedly speculated about a possible tie-up between t-systems and a foreign firm , with french groups atos origin and capgemini , or us firm eds mooted as potential partners . heavy losses due to restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom workers protested against job cuts on wednesday deutsche telekom said that fourth-quarter earnings were hit by fierce competition in its home market and heavy one-off charges . the group booked a bottom-line loss of 898 million euros in the period from october to december , compared with net profit of 991 million euros in the same period a year earlier .
the numbers were affected by restructuring charges .

" we have a big advantage .
they need the parts we make but we do n't need management , " head of the works council in varel , jürgen bruns , said in a fiery speech . " praised !
betrayed !
sold ! " read the banners at the laupheim rally , referring to the bitterness many workers felt after airbus ' sunny outlook just two years ago clouded over setbacks with its a380 superjumbo jet programme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus workers are outraged by the restructuring bid airbus parent company eads triggered the protests with the announcement wednesday of its " power8 " rescue scheme to axe 10,000 jobs in germany , france , britain and spain and trim its factory network . on thursday , airbus also announced it had suspended development of the cargo version of its giant a380 superjumbo jet , but said it would continue looking for clients for the freight plane . three clients had placed orders for the airbus cargo superjumbo plane by november , but since then one has been scrapped and two others were also poised to be cancelled . " we are not stopping the program , " said an airbus spokesman .
" we are suspending development , but we will continue canvassing for business . " union anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-chief executive louis gallois germany 's powerful ig metall trade union for the engineering and metal-working industries vowed to fight the sale of airbus plants and protect german jobs with efforts to boost productivity and create more flexible work contracts . the head of the union 's northern chapter , jutta blankau , announced a european-wide protest movement against the restructuring plan . " we hope to mobilize employees across europe in the next 14 days , " blankau said .
" we have spoken with trade unions in the other countries " where airbus has plants . " " we oppose any sell-off or closure of a plant .
our slogan is if one is affected , all are affected , " she said . bildunterschrift : the head of the works council for the seven airbus plants in germany , rüdiger lütjens , said the decision to slash jobs and trim the network of plants in europe made little sense . " our orders list is full , which shows how popular our products are .
we do not understand why plants need to be sold , " he said . under the restructuring plans , two of the seven german sites - laupheim and varel - are to be sold , while an industrial partner will be sought for nordenham . political support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german airbus plant in varel is to be sold the northern state of lower saxony threw its weight behind the employees .
although he welcomed the plans in principle wednesday , state premier christian wulff promised thursday to fight job cuts in his state . " we reject airbus ' plans to abandon its plants , " he said . chancellor angela merkel said wednesday that germany could have been hit harder if it were not for her government 's efforts , in comments echoed by local leaders thursday . airbus plans to slash jobs across europe in the next four years , with 4,300 cuts in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain . originally , germany had feared that up to 8,000 of its jobs could be on the line .
airbus 's seven german sites currently employ a workforce of around 21,000 . a hot potato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus was the subject of a satirical float at the rose monday carnival parade in mainz the berlin daily der tagesspiegel said that airbus had become a political hot potato , overriding the powers of its chief executive louis gallois . " airbus is becoming an issue in the french election campaign , " it said in an editorial .
" an economically effective overhaul is impossible under these circumstances . " the munich-based newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , however , said it was wise for airbus to gird itself for tougher times . " it is good for the company to undergo a restructuring and cut costs now during an unprecedented boom in the aircraft manufacturing industry , " it said . " only then will airbus survive the inevitable downturn . " international balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for economic affairs , michael glos , left parity in cutting jobs had been requested by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel at a meeting between the heads of state last friday . merkel said on wednesday that the " principle of fair distribution " appeared to have been respected in the restructuring plan for european aircraft maker airbus . germany 's economy minister michael glos said the restructuring plan offered a " good basis " for the future of airbus . " we all agreed that this is about securing the long-term future of company and of a great european project , " he told reporters .
" from my point of view , today 's decision was a good basis for this .
i also think that the distribution of burdens looks balanced . " a turnaround in fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at an airbus plant in hamburg the european planemaker is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits .
it also faces pressure from a weakening dollar , which makes airbus airliners more expensive in international markets . " the plan will make airbus better prepared to face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , increased competitive pressure , the financial burden related to the a380 delays , as well as to meet its other future investment needs , " airbus said in a statement . airbus is owned by eads , which is controlled by french shareholders media group lagardere and the french state , and german shareholder car maker daimlerchrysler .

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .
" at octoshape we do n't have any animals , so it 's really not needed . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german man refuses to testify early in the morning what would you do if you were asked by the police to testify early in the morning ?

" contrary to what was the case in the past , we 're no longer excluding expanding abroad via acquisitions , particularly in mobile telephony , " obermann said . the chief executive refused to rule out large-scale acquisitions , as long as they made sense and fulfilled " strict financial criteria , " he said . targeting fast-growth markets quizzed about the possible takeover targets , obermann replied : " we 're very dependent on the german , european and us markets .
but we do n't have any substantial presence in fast-growing markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could telekom be looking for indian customers ?
deutsche telekom would therefore look in that direction , he said , while refusing to name any specific country . british mobile phone giant vodafone recently moved into the indian market by buying hutchison essar for more than $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.3 billion euros -rrb- .
deutsche telekom had looked ready to embark on a major shopping spree last year when it bought austrian mobile operator , tele.ring. but since then , it has had to focus on its own problems at home caused by ferocious price competition and a massive outflux of fixed-line customers . selling assets , finding partners deutsche telekom would create financial room for manoeuvre by selling off non-strategic assets , obermann said .
up for sale were french and spanish internet access providers club internet and ya.com , as well as the t-systems media and broadcast unit , a service provider for the broadcasting and media industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom needs some cash first asked about the amount of money such divestments could raise , finance chief karl-gerhard eick said that " three billion euros could be feasible in a relatively short term .

contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo . in an interview with german tv program " monitor , " pierre-richard prosper , the us government 's former ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues until oct 2005 , said that german officials never contacted him about releasing kurnaz from the detention camp .

he says he was tortured and abused at the camp . german government officials have denied delaying the release of kurnaz , who has turkish citizenship , but grew up in germany .
the case is now under investigation by a parliamentary committee .

he is expected to testify before the parliamentary committee on march 22 . documents withheld on thursday , the investigation by the parliamentary committee was held up as some official documents relating to murat kurnaz were delayed .
the papers are reportedly files from german domestic intelligence agency sources in bremen alleging that kurnaz had links to radical islamists . siegfried kauder , chairman of a parliament investigation committee , said he had requested the files from authorities in the northwestern city-state of bremen and had been assured weeks ago that they were on their way .

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .
" at octoshape we do n't have any animals , so it 's really not needed . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german man refuses to testify early in the morning what would you do if you were asked by the police to testify early in the morning ?

but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .

one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .
" at octoshape we do n't have any animals , so it 's really not needed . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german man refuses to testify early in the morning what would you do if you were asked by the police to testify early in the morning ?

the european union launched a new fundamental rights agency in vienna on thursday .
will it prove to be another bureaucratic toothless tiger , as critics wonder , or can the bureau effectively pack a punch ? asylum , anti-semitism , xenophobia , freedom of movement , data protection , discrimination - this is the to-do list for the european union 's new fundamental rights agency . the organization is there to do research , write reports and raise awareness .
legal action is out of the question . the best case scenario is that the agency will be attentive and offer helpful warnings and admonishments , said hannes tretter from the boltzmann institute for human rights in vienna . " it should keep up the public dialogue with politicians and with all those involved in a democratic , pluralistic society , " added tretter . look but do n't touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european court of human rights in strasbourg has handles human rights issues for decades with its annual reports and regular analyses , the 100-member fundamental rights agency is to draw attention to situations where eu regulations are not being observed in any of the bloc 's 27 member states . the particularly delicate topics , however , are off limits .
the agency wo n't be allowed to criticize police and judicial authorities , for example . " the eu states do n't want interference in their human rights policies , " dick oosting , director of human rights group amnesty international 's europe office , told news agency afp . oosting added that he did n't think the agency would be able to contribute much to the protection of rights in the eu because of the tight restrictions placed on its mandate . too many cooks in the kitchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis of britain is the council of europe 's secretary general the limitations place on human rights in the name of anti-terror measures , the plight of the roma in southeastern european and the devastating situation of many refugees in europe are areas where the eu agency wo n't be effective , said oosting . critics have also emphasized the redundancy of the new fundamental rights agency , as it is the council of europe in strasbourg which has traditionally been responsible for human rights in the bloc . " i expect that the fundamental rights agency will listen to our advice and benefit from our more than 50 years of experience , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said thursday at the inauguration ceremony in vienna . " if we work together , we can improve things , " added davis .
" but if we work separately , we risk wasting tax money .

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .

contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo . in an interview with german tv program " monitor , " pierre-richard prosper , the us government 's former ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues until oct 2005 , said that german officials never contacted him about releasing kurnaz from the detention camp . " during my entire time in office , germany never showed any interest and i was the person to contact within the us government , " said prosper , who was responsible for returning guantanamo inmates to their home countries from 2002 to 2005 . german efforts to get kurnaz released ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz arriving at a parliamentary hearing in january kurnaz was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of being a terrorist and spent more than four years in detention before being released without charge from guantanamo in 2006 .
he says he was tortured and abused at the camp . german government officials have denied delaying the release of kurnaz , who has turkish citizenship , but grew up in germany .
the case is now under investigation by a parliamentary committee .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , has come under fire for his role . steinmeier has said that the schröder government repeatedly talked to us officials about the kurnaz case and lobbied for his release . pros per : kurnaz ready for release since 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosper -lrb- right -rrb- in 2005 but prosper , who left public service to work as an attorney at the beginning of the year , said he did n't know of any such conversations . " if the german government would have said : ' we want kurnaz , ' we would have immediately sat down to come to an agreement , " prosper said , according to german translations of the interview . prosper added that it was " not a secret " that kurnaz had been " considered for release " since 2002 . no us demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier " germany and turkey knew , or should have known , that the us was ready to talk about his release , " he said , adding that us officials were interested in reducing the number of guantanamo inmates drastically . prosper also said that us officials did not ask their german counterparts to use kurnaz as an intelligence contact in islamist groups in germany upon his release , as steinmeier has claimed . steinmeier has not commented on prosper 's statements .
he is expected to testify before the parliamentary committee on march 22 . documents withheld on thursday , the investigation by the parliamentary committee was held up as some official documents relating to murat kurnaz were delayed .
the papers are reportedly files from german domestic intelligence agency sources in bremen alleging that kurnaz had links to radical islamists . siegfried kauder , chairman of a parliament investigation committee , said he had requested the files from authorities in the northwestern city-state of bremen and had been assured weeks ago that they were on their way .

" and that 's why it 's obvious that europe alone can not solve the climate problem . " merkel said it was time to act and urged government leaders to follow the recommendations of the european commission , which has called for a 20-percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 . she said the 27-member bloc needed to invest more in new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat the effects of climate change and emphasized that this was an opportunity to demonstrate leadership .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .
he later made a public confession . some priests forced to spy in one of his rare interviews , father isakowicz zaleski explained the motivation behind his book .
using a quote from a poem he wrote , he said that , in a world full of people who do not respect christian values , it is his duty to come out with the truth to reach out to ordinary polish roman catholics . the church , he stressed , must confess and repent in order to heal old wounds . church sources admit that some 10 percent of polish priests were once involved in collaboration with the secret police , many of them having been coerced into serving the communist state . normalization will take time there have been few official reactions to the publication from polish church circles , apart from a statement by józef kloch , spokesman for the polish episcopate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church must confess and repent , said father isakowicz zaleski " one needs time to fully digest the facts contained in the book , " said kloch .
" if one acts hastily , one ends up with sensational media headlines based on randomly selected facts taken out of context , " he added . father adam boniecki , publisher of a liberal catholic weekly , said he believed the present crisis may be painful , but that it would eventually lead to a more normal relationship between the church and its followers , based on a sound understanding of the past . some question political motives according to british catholic journalist bill foreman , who lives in warsaw , the book ’ s publication and the recent spy scandal involving archbishop wielgus have deepened divisions within the polish roman catholic community . while many ordinary polish roman catholics welcome the arrival of the book , some question the author ’ s motives as political .
critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .
he later made a public confession . some priests forced to spy in one of his rare interviews , father isakowicz zaleski explained the motivation behind his book .
using a quote from a poem he wrote , he said that , in a world full of people who do not respect christian values , it is his duty to come out with the truth to reach out to ordinary polish roman catholics . the church , he stressed , must confess and repent in order to heal old wounds . church sources admit that some 10 percent of polish priests were once involved in collaboration with the secret police , many of them having been coerced into serving the communist state . normalization will take time there have been few official reactions to the publication from polish church circles , apart from a statement by józef kloch , spokesman for the polish episcopate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church must confess and repent , said father isakowicz zaleski " one needs time to fully digest the facts contained in the book , " said kloch .
" if one acts hastily , one ends up with sensational media headlines based on randomly selected facts taken out of context , " he added . father adam boniecki , publisher of a liberal catholic weekly , said he believed the present crisis may be painful , but that it would eventually lead to a more normal relationship between the church and its followers , based on a sound understanding of the past . some question political motives according to british catholic journalist bill foreman , who lives in warsaw , the book ’ s publication and the recent spy scandal involving archbishop wielgus have deepened divisions within the polish roman catholic community . while many ordinary polish roman catholics welcome the arrival of the book , some question the author ’ s motives as political .
critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

" the favorable developments of the past few months are continuing .
the employment trend is gaining momentum , " weise said . adjusted for the usual seasonal effects , the german jobless total was down even more sharply , falling by 79,000 to 3.897 million , with the adjusted jobless rate falling to 9.3 percent from 9.5 percent , separate data published by the bundesbank in frankfurt showed . the government hailed the figures .
" it 's been a long time since unemployment declined in the month of february , " said labor minister franz müntefering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering urged germans to be cautious " we 've had good news on the labor market since spring 2006 and the good news has continued this month .
the situation suggests a further improvement .
2007 could be a good year when unemployment falls sharply , " müntefering continued .
but he cautioned : " there 's no cause for celebration yet .
a lot of hard work is still necessary . " analysts were also pleased by the latest jobless statistics . " germany is still enjoying the sweet side of the business cycle , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . " while inflation remains roughly half a percentage point lower than it was a year ago , despite the vat hike , unemployment is continuing to fall at an astonishing pace , " schmieding said . inflation down despite vat hike on tuesday , the latest consumer price data showed that german inflation stood at 1.6 percent in february , comfortably below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent as falling oil prices took the sting out of a sharp increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- at the beginning of this year . hvb economist alexander koch calculated that the seasonally adjusted jobless total is now at its lowest level since august 2001 . and the jobless queues had shrunk by 820,000 over the past year , which could only be positive for consumer spending and overall economic growth this year , analysts said . optimistic forecasts of sustainable recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are likely to contribute to a spring surge " german labor markets are booming and this is a very positive omen for sustainable recovery going forwards , " said bear stearns economist , david brown . hvb 's koch predicted that the jobless total would continue to fall in the coming months . " the business outlook and above all investment plans in the corporate sector signal further good news from the labors market in the coming months , " he said .
but ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer was skeptical . " the improvement in the february data is not real , but mainly reflects a statistical effect due to the absence of winter .
the trend in seasonally adjusted unemployment has to reverse in the second quarter , " he predicted . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany to continue borrowing despite boom the german government is to continue to borrow over the years ahead , despite a growing economy , according to a news report .

" we have a big advantage .
they need the parts we make but we do n't need management , " head of the works council in varel , jürgen bruns , said in a fiery speech . " praised !
betrayed !
sold ! " read the banners at the laupheim rally , referring to the bitterness many workers felt after airbus ' sunny outlook just two years ago clouded over setbacks with its a380 superjumbo jet programme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus workers are outraged by the restructuring bid airbus parent company eads triggered the protests with the announcement wednesday of its " power8 " rescue scheme to axe 10,000 jobs in germany , france , britain and spain and trim its factory network . on thursday , airbus also announced it had suspended development of the cargo version of its giant a380 superjumbo jet , but said it would continue looking for clients for the freight plane . three clients had placed orders for the airbus cargo superjumbo plane by november , but since then one has been scrapped and two others were also poised to be cancelled . " we are not stopping the program , " said an airbus spokesman .
" we are suspending development , but we will continue canvassing for business . " union anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-chief executive louis gallois germany 's powerful ig metall trade union for the engineering and metal-working industries vowed to fight the sale of airbus plants and protect german jobs with efforts to boost productivity and create more flexible work contracts . the head of the union 's northern chapter , jutta blankau , announced a european-wide protest movement against the restructuring plan . " we hope to mobilize employees across europe in the next 14 days , " blankau said .
" we have spoken with trade unions in the other countries " where airbus has plants . " " we oppose any sell-off or closure of a plant .
our slogan is if one is affected , all are affected , " she said . bildunterschrift : the head of the works council for the seven airbus plants in germany , rüdiger lütjens , said the decision to slash jobs and trim the network of plants in europe made little sense . " our orders list is full , which shows how popular our products are .
we do not understand why plants need to be sold , " he said . under the restructuring plans , two of the seven german sites - laupheim and varel - are to be sold , while an industrial partner will be sought for nordenham . political support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german airbus plant in varel is to be sold the northern state of lower saxony threw its weight behind the employees .
although he welcomed the plans in principle wednesday , state premier christian wulff promised thursday to fight job cuts in his state . " we reject airbus ' plans to abandon its plants , " he said . chancellor angela merkel said wednesday that germany could have been hit harder if it were not for her government 's efforts , in comments echoed by local leaders thursday . airbus plans to slash jobs across europe in the next four years , with 4,300 cuts in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain . originally , germany had feared that up to 8,000 of its jobs could be on the line .
airbus 's seven german sites currently employ a workforce of around 21,000 . a hot potato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus was the subject of a satirical float at the rose monday carnival parade in mainz the berlin daily der tagesspiegel said that airbus had become a political hot potato , overriding the powers of its chief executive louis gallois . " airbus is becoming an issue in the french election campaign , " it said in an editorial .
" an economically effective overhaul is impossible under these circumstances . " the munich-based newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , however , said it was wise for airbus to gird itself for tougher times . " it is good for the company to undergo a restructuring and cut costs now during an unprecedented boom in the aircraft manufacturing industry , " it said . " only then will airbus survive the inevitable downturn . " international balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for economic affairs , michael glos , left parity in cutting jobs had been requested by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel at a meeting between the heads of state last friday . merkel said on wednesday that the " principle of fair distribution " appeared to have been respected in the restructuring plan for european aircraft maker airbus . germany 's economy minister michael glos said the restructuring plan offered a " good basis " for the future of airbus . " we all agreed that this is about securing the long-term future of company and of a great european project , " he told reporters .
" from my point of view , today 's decision was a good basis for this .
i also think that the distribution of burdens looks balanced . " a turnaround in fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at an airbus plant in hamburg the european planemaker is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits .
it also faces pressure from a weakening dollar , which makes airbus airliners more expensive in international markets . " the plan will make airbus better prepared to face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , increased competitive pressure , the financial burden related to the a380 delays , as well as to meet its other future investment needs , " airbus said in a statement . airbus is owned by eads , which is controlled by french shareholders media group lagardere and the french state , and german shareholder car maker daimlerchrysler .

" we have an obligation to offer them a perspective to get closer to the european union and eventually be members , " he said . ministers agree to scale down troops in bosnia on thursday , eu defense ministers brought forward a move to cut troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . jung however declined to put a date on the departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says the eu will partially withdraw troops from bosnia " we need to look at how stability evolves in the region .
we must not jeopardize what we have gradually build up over the years , " he said . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " he also urged bosnia to continue with its police reforms . britain to pull out all troops on wednesday , the outgoing head of the eu military staff , lieutenant general jean-paul perruche , said the troop reduction would take " three or four months " but that the force would be able to do a quick about face if trouble arose . cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . britain thursday announced the withdrawal of all its 600 troops from bosnia amid opposition claims it was being forced to " scratch around " for extra manpower to send to afghanistan . the eu is likely to send 400 people to kosovo to " help the kosovars maintain order , " said an eu diplomat , once the future status of the serbian province becomes clear . but the european union requires a united nations mandate to deploy and replace the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , and it is expected to take some time before a security council resolution can be drawn up . " unmik remains fully in charge until un security council resolution 1244 is replaced by another -lrb- resolution -rrb- , which should provide a clear mandate for the future international presence , " solana said . kosovo future remains uncertain serbian and kosovo authorities are at loggerheads over how much autonomy the province should be granted , and russia is threatening to use its security council veto to block any attempt to impose independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates from serbia and kosovo at the start last month of a final round of talks on the future of kosovo for the time being , the 27 eu countries " can only prepare as much as they can so that when the time comes they can be as efficient , clear and precise as possible , " the diplomat said . " i hope and i wish that the two sides can show a willingness to reach a compromise , " said jung . the 16,000-strong nato force in kosovo will continue to lead military operations there . the ministers , along with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , also looked at ways to improve cooperation between the eu and the western alliance . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .

" we have a big advantage .
they need the parts we make but we do n't need management , " head of the works council in varel , jürgen bruns , said in a fiery speech . " praised !
betrayed !
sold ! " read the banners at the laupheim rally , referring to the bitterness many workers felt after airbus ' sunny outlook just two years ago clouded over setbacks with its a380 superjumbo jet programme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus workers are outraged by the restructuring bid airbus parent company eads triggered the protests with the announcement wednesday of its " power8 " rescue scheme to axe 10,000 jobs in germany , france , britain and spain and trim its factory network . on thursday , airbus also announced it had suspended development of the cargo version of its giant a380 superjumbo jet , but said it would continue looking for clients for the freight plane . three clients had placed orders for the airbus cargo superjumbo plane by november , but since then one has been scrapped and two others were also poised to be cancelled . " we are not stopping the program , " said an airbus spokesman .
" we are suspending development , but we will continue canvassing for business . " union anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-chief executive louis gallois germany 's powerful ig metall trade union for the engineering and metal-working industries vowed to fight the sale of airbus plants and protect german jobs with efforts to boost productivity and create more flexible work contracts . the head of the union 's northern chapter , jutta blankau , announced a european-wide protest movement against the restructuring plan . " we hope to mobilize employees across europe in the next 14 days , " blankau said .
" we have spoken with trade unions in the other countries " where airbus has plants . " " we oppose any sell-off or closure of a plant .
our slogan is if one is affected , all are affected , " she said . bildunterschrift : the head of the works council for the seven airbus plants in germany , rüdiger lütjens , said the decision to slash jobs and trim the network of plants in europe made little sense . " our orders list is full , which shows how popular our products are .
we do not understand why plants need to be sold , " he said . under the restructuring plans , two of the seven german sites - laupheim and varel - are to be sold , while an industrial partner will be sought for nordenham . political support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german airbus plant in varel is to be sold the northern state of lower saxony threw its weight behind the employees .
although he welcomed the plans in principle wednesday , state premier christian wulff promised thursday to fight job cuts in his state . " we reject airbus ' plans to abandon its plants , " he said . chancellor angela merkel said wednesday that germany could have been hit harder if it were not for her government 's efforts , in comments echoed by local leaders thursday . airbus plans to slash jobs across europe in the next four years , with 4,300 cuts in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain . originally , germany had feared that up to 8,000 of its jobs could be on the line .
airbus 's seven german sites currently employ a workforce of around 21,000 . a hot potato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus was the subject of a satirical float at the rose monday carnival parade in mainz the berlin daily der tagesspiegel said that airbus had become a political hot potato , overriding the powers of its chief executive louis gallois . " airbus is becoming an issue in the french election campaign , " it said in an editorial .
" an economically effective overhaul is impossible under these circumstances . " the munich-based newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , however , said it was wise for airbus to gird itself for tougher times . " it is good for the company to undergo a restructuring and cut costs now during an unprecedented boom in the aircraft manufacturing industry , " it said . " only then will airbus survive the inevitable downturn . " international balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for economic affairs , michael glos , left parity in cutting jobs had been requested by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel at a meeting between the heads of state last friday . merkel said on wednesday that the " principle of fair distribution " appeared to have been respected in the restructuring plan for european aircraft maker airbus . germany 's economy minister michael glos said the restructuring plan offered a " good basis " for the future of airbus . " we all agreed that this is about securing the long-term future of company and of a great european project , " he told reporters .
" from my point of view , today 's decision was a good basis for this .
i also think that the distribution of burdens looks balanced . " a turnaround in fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at an airbus plant in hamburg the european planemaker is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits .
it also faces pressure from a weakening dollar , which makes airbus airliners more expensive in international markets . " the plan will make airbus better prepared to face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , increased competitive pressure , the financial burden related to the a380 delays , as well as to meet its other future investment needs , " airbus said in a statement . airbus is owned by eads , which is controlled by french shareholders media group lagardere and the french state , and german shareholder car maker daimlerchrysler .

" contrary to what was the case in the past , we 're no longer excluding expanding abroad via acquisitions , particularly in mobile telephony , " obermann said . the chief executive refused to rule out large-scale acquisitions , as long as they made sense and fulfilled " strict financial criteria , " he said . targeting fast-growth markets quizzed about the possible takeover targets , obermann replied : " we 're very dependent on the german , european and us markets .
but we do n't have any substantial presence in fast-growing markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could telekom be looking for indian customers ?
deutsche telekom would therefore look in that direction , he said , while refusing to name any specific country . british mobile phone giant vodafone recently moved into the indian market by buying hutchison essar for more than $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.3 billion euros -rrb- .
deutsche telekom had looked ready to embark on a major shopping spree last year when it bought austrian mobile operator , tele.ring. but since then , it has had to focus on its own problems at home caused by ferocious price competition and a massive outflux of fixed-line customers . selling assets , finding partners deutsche telekom would create financial room for manoeuvre by selling off non-strategic assets , obermann said .
up for sale were french and spanish internet access providers club internet and ya.com , as well as the t-systems media and broadcast unit , a service provider for the broadcasting and media industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom needs some cash first asked about the amount of money such divestments could raise , finance chief karl-gerhard eick said that " three billion euros could be feasible in a relatively short term . "
but the sum " could be more , " he said . the group said it also planned to sell its radio towers in germany and the united states , and the remaining shares in real estate company sireo . obermann said deutsche telekom was also on the look-out for a strategic partner for its information and communications technology unit , t-systems .
press reports have repeatedly speculated about a possible tie-up between t-systems and a foreign firm , with french groups atos origin and capgemini , or us firm eds mooted as potential partners . heavy losses due to restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom workers protested against job cuts on wednesday deutsche telekom said that fourth-quarter earnings were hit by fierce competition in its home market and heavy one-off charges . the group booked a bottom-line loss of 898 million euros in the period from october to december , compared with net profit of 991 million euros in the same period a year earlier .
the numbers were affected by restructuring charges .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .

" if one acts hastily , one ends up with sensational media headlines based on randomly selected facts taken out of context , " he added . father adam boniecki , publisher of a liberal catholic weekly , said he believed the present crisis may be painful , but that it would eventually lead to a more normal relationship between the church and its followers , based on a sound understanding of the past . some question political motives according to british catholic journalist bill foreman , who lives in warsaw , the book ’ s publication and the recent spy scandal involving archbishop wielgus have deepened divisions within the polish roman catholic community . while many ordinary polish roman catholics welcome the arrival of the book , some question the author ’ s motives as political .
critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .
he later made a public confession . some priests forced to spy in one of his rare interviews , father isakowicz zaleski explained the motivation behind his book .
using a quote from a poem he wrote , he said that , in a world full of people who do not respect christian values , it is his duty to come out with the truth to reach out to ordinary polish roman catholics . the church , he stressed , must confess and repent in order to heal old wounds . church sources admit that some 10 percent of polish priests were once involved in collaboration with the secret police , many of them having been coerced into serving the communist state . normalization will take time there have been few official reactions to the publication from polish church circles , apart from a statement by józef kloch , spokesman for the polish episcopate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church must confess and repent , said father isakowicz zaleski " one needs time to fully digest the facts contained in the book , " said kloch .

critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

" we have a big advantage .
they need the parts we make but we do n't need management , " head of the works council in varel , jürgen bruns , said in a fiery speech . " praised !
betrayed !
sold ! " read the banners at the laupheim rally , referring to the bitterness many workers felt after airbus ' sunny outlook just two years ago clouded over setbacks with its a380 superjumbo jet programme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus workers are outraged by the restructuring bid airbus parent company eads triggered the protests with the announcement wednesday of its " power8 " rescue scheme to axe 10,000 jobs in germany , france , britain and spain and trim its factory network . on thursday , airbus also announced it had suspended development of the cargo version of its giant a380 superjumbo jet , but said it would continue looking for clients for the freight plane . three clients had placed orders for the airbus cargo superjumbo plane by november , but since then one has been scrapped and two others were also poised to be cancelled . " we are not stopping the program , " said an airbus spokesman .
" we are suspending development , but we will continue canvassing for business . " union anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-chief executive louis gallois germany 's powerful ig metall trade union for the engineering and metal-working industries vowed to fight the sale of airbus plants and protect german jobs with efforts to boost productivity and create more flexible work contracts . the head of the union 's northern chapter , jutta blankau , announced a european-wide protest movement against the restructuring plan . " we hope to mobilize employees across europe in the next 14 days , " blankau said .
" we have spoken with trade unions in the other countries " where airbus has plants . " " we oppose any sell-off or closure of a plant .

" an economically effective overhaul is impossible under these circumstances . " the munich-based newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , however , said it was wise for airbus to gird itself for tougher times .

" we have an obligation to offer them a perspective to get closer to the european union and eventually be members , " he said . ministers agree to scale down troops in bosnia on thursday , eu defense ministers brought forward a move to cut troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . jung however declined to put a date on the departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says the eu will partially withdraw troops from bosnia " we need to look at how stability evolves in the region .
we must not jeopardize what we have gradually build up over the years , " he said . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " he also urged bosnia to continue with its police reforms . britain to pull out all troops on wednesday , the outgoing head of the eu military staff , lieutenant general jean-paul perruche , said the troop reduction would take " three or four months " but that the force would be able to do a quick about face if trouble arose . cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . britain thursday announced the withdrawal of all its 600 troops from bosnia amid opposition claims it was being forced to " scratch around " for extra manpower to send to afghanistan . the eu is likely to send 400 people to kosovo to " help the kosovars maintain order , " said an eu diplomat , once the future status of the serbian province becomes clear . but the european union requires a united nations mandate to deploy and replace the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , and it is expected to take some time before a security council resolution can be drawn up . " unmik remains fully in charge until un security council resolution 1244 is replaced by another -lrb- resolution -rrb- , which should provide a clear mandate for the future international presence , " solana said . kosovo future remains uncertain serbian and kosovo authorities are at loggerheads over how much autonomy the province should be granted , and russia is threatening to use its security council veto to block any attempt to impose independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates from serbia and kosovo at the start last month of a final round of talks on the future of kosovo for the time being , the 27 eu countries " can only prepare as much as they can so that when the time comes they can be as efficient , clear and precise as possible , " the diplomat said . " i hope and i wish that the two sides can show a willingness to reach a compromise , " said jung . the 16,000-strong nato force in kosovo will continue to lead military operations there . the ministers , along with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , also looked at ways to improve cooperation between the eu and the western alliance . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

" and that 's why it 's obvious that europe alone can not solve the climate problem . " merkel said it was time to act and urged government leaders to follow the recommendations of the european commission , which has called for a 20-percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 . she said the 27-member bloc needed to invest more in new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat the effects of climate change and emphasized that this was an opportunity to demonstrate leadership .

some countries , notably britain , have strong reservations about the constitution . " europe is our future , " she said , adding that problems such as environmental protection , illegal immigration , global trade and international security can not be resolved by individual states . achievements and goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto negotiations were revived last month merkel said that a summit in the german capital , which will take place in the last week of march to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding , would result in a berlin declaration , setting out past achievements and naming goals for the future . the german chancellor also vowed to push ahead with efforts to get a deal on world trade this year , saying that an agreement was urgent . " it is a priority for us to successfully reach a conclusion in the doha cycle and we are strongly committed to this , " merkel said .
" we are aware that the european union , and germany , the world 's biggest exporter , can benefit from this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 01.03.2007 late sleepers in denmark rally for societal change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not being the most productive she can be a fast-growing group of people in denmark who do n't get along at all with the morning is lobbying employers and institutions to throw off the yoke of nine to five .
they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .
" at octoshape we do n't have any animals , so it 's really not needed . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german man refuses to testify early in the morning what would you do if you were asked by the police to testify early in the morning ?

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .

" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .

" contrary to what was the case in the past , we 're no longer excluding expanding abroad via acquisitions , particularly in mobile telephony , " obermann said . the chief executive refused to rule out large-scale acquisitions , as long as they made sense and fulfilled " strict financial criteria , " he said . targeting fast-growth markets quizzed about the possible takeover targets , obermann replied : " we 're very dependent on the german , european and us markets .
but we do n't have any substantial presence in fast-growing markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could telekom be looking for indian customers ?
deutsche telekom would therefore look in that direction , he said , while refusing to name any specific country . british mobile phone giant vodafone recently moved into the indian market by buying hutchison essar for more than $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.3 billion euros -rrb- .
deutsche telekom had looked ready to embark on a major shopping spree last year when it bought austrian mobile operator , tele.ring. but since then , it has had to focus on its own problems at home caused by ferocious price competition and a massive outflux of fixed-line customers . selling assets , finding partners deutsche telekom would create financial room for manoeuvre by selling off non-strategic assets , obermann said .
up for sale were french and spanish internet access providers club internet and ya.com , as well as the t-systems media and broadcast unit , a service provider for the broadcasting and media industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom needs some cash first asked about the amount of money such divestments could raise , finance chief karl-gerhard eick said that " three billion euros could be feasible in a relatively short term . "
but the sum " could be more , " he said . the group said it also planned to sell its radio towers in germany and the united states , and the remaining shares in real estate company sireo . obermann said deutsche telekom was also on the look-out for a strategic partner for its information and communications technology unit , t-systems .
press reports have repeatedly speculated about a possible tie-up between t-systems and a foreign firm , with french groups atos origin and capgemini , or us firm eds mooted as potential partners . heavy losses due to restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom workers protested against job cuts on wednesday deutsche telekom said that fourth-quarter earnings were hit by fierce competition in its home market and heavy one-off charges . the group booked a bottom-line loss of 898 million euros in the period from october to december , compared with net profit of 991 million euros in the same period a year earlier .
the numbers were affected by restructuring charges .

" it makes no difference if you ask for the tickets on the first or last day of this period , " said christian schmölzer , head of the tournament in austria .
" there 's a whole month to do it all and no reason to rush . " applicants can order a maximum of one match a day for the tournament next year and up to four tickets a match . with demand expected to exceed supply for some matches , a lottery will determine the successful applications .
officials said successful ticket buyers would know by the end of april . resisting the black market uefa had earlier warned the public against purchasing tickets through any other channel on the black market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmölzer , austrian director of the euro2008 , left , told the fans not to rush " the products being offered by other companies , or on other platforms , are not part of , or related to , the official ticket sales program , " uefa said in a statement . " supporters are strongly recommended not to buy tickets through these channels . " another 38 percent of the 1.05 million tickets will be allocated to national associations of the 16 teams that qualify . " since the stadiums are relatively small , our aim was to ensure that the largest possible percentage of tickets would go to supporters , " said swiss organizer christian mutschler . tickets will carry the name of the buyer in an attempt to prevent misuse . preventing the hooligans swiss football federation secretary peter gillieron told news agency afp that fellow associations and national authorities were well placed to regulate organized attempts to purchase tickets for potential hooligans . the fact that the first batch was being sold before fans knew who would qualify - apart from the austrians and swiss , who are in groups a and b - and by lottery , was likely to be an added deterrent , he added . the draw for the tournament is due in december after the qualifiers are known .

" it makes no difference if you ask for the tickets on the first or last day of this period , " said christian schmölzer , head of the tournament in austria .
" there 's a whole month to do it all and no reason to rush . " applicants can order a maximum of one match a day for the tournament next year and up to four tickets a match . with demand expected to exceed supply for some matches , a lottery will determine the successful applications .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .

contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo . in an interview with german tv program " monitor , " pierre-richard prosper , the us government 's former ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues until oct 2005 , said that german officials never contacted him about releasing kurnaz from the detention camp . " during my entire time in office , germany never showed any interest and i was the person to contact within the us government , " said prosper , who was responsible for returning guantanamo inmates to their home countries from 2002 to 2005 . german efforts to get kurnaz released ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz arriving at a parliamentary hearing in january kurnaz was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of being a terrorist and spent more than four years in detention before being released without charge from guantanamo in 2006 .
he says he was tortured and abused at the camp . german government officials have denied delaying the release of kurnaz , who has turkish citizenship , but grew up in germany .
the case is now under investigation by a parliamentary committee .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , has come under fire for his role . steinmeier has said that the schröder government repeatedly talked to us officials about the kurnaz case and lobbied for his release . pros per : kurnaz ready for release since 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosper -lrb- right -rrb- in 2005 but prosper , who left public service to work as an attorney at the beginning of the year , said he did n't know of any such conversations . " if the german government would have said : ' we want kurnaz , ' we would have immediately sat down to come to an agreement , " prosper said , according to german translations of the interview . prosper added that it was " not a secret " that kurnaz had been " considered for release " since 2002 . no us demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier " germany and turkey knew , or should have known , that the us was ready to talk about his release , " he said , adding that us officials were interested in reducing the number of guantanamo inmates drastically . prosper also said that us officials did not ask their german counterparts to use kurnaz as an intelligence contact in islamist groups in germany upon his release , as steinmeier has claimed . steinmeier has not commented on prosper 's statements .
he is expected to testify before the parliamentary committee on march 22 . documents withheld on thursday , the investigation by the parliamentary committee was held up as some official documents relating to murat kurnaz were delayed .
the papers are reportedly files from german domestic intelligence agency sources in bremen alleging that kurnaz had links to radical islamists . siegfried kauder , chairman of a parliament investigation committee , said he had requested the files from authorities in the northwestern city-state of bremen and had been assured weeks ago that they were on their way .

" and that 's why it 's obvious that europe alone can not solve the climate problem . " merkel said it was time to act and urged government leaders to follow the recommendations of the european commission , which has called for a 20-percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 . she said the 27-member bloc needed to invest more in new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat the effects of climate change and emphasized that this was an opportunity to demonstrate leadership .

" it is a priority for us to successfully reach a conclusion in the doha cycle and we are strongly committed to this , " merkel said .
" we are aware that the european union , and germany , the world 's biggest exporter , can benefit from this .

" we have an obligation to offer them a perspective to get closer to the european union and eventually be members , " he said . ministers agree to scale down troops in bosnia on thursday , eu defense ministers brought forward a move to cut troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . jung however declined to put a date on the departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says the eu will partially withdraw troops from bosnia " we need to look at how stability evolves in the region .
we must not jeopardize what we have gradually build up over the years , " he said . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " he also urged bosnia to continue with its police reforms . britain to pull out all troops on wednesday , the outgoing head of the eu military staff , lieutenant general jean-paul perruche , said the troop reduction would take " three or four months " but that the force would be able to do a quick about face if trouble arose . cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . britain thursday announced the withdrawal of all its 600 troops from bosnia amid opposition claims it was being forced to " scratch around " for extra manpower to send to afghanistan . the eu is likely to send 400 people to kosovo to " help the kosovars maintain order , " said an eu diplomat , once the future status of the serbian province becomes clear . but the european union requires a united nations mandate to deploy and replace the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , and it is expected to take some time before a security council resolution can be drawn up . " unmik remains fully in charge until un security council resolution 1244 is replaced by another -lrb- resolution -rrb- , which should provide a clear mandate for the future international presence , " solana said . kosovo future remains uncertain serbian and kosovo authorities are at loggerheads over how much autonomy the province should be granted , and russia is threatening to use its security council veto to block any attempt to impose independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates from serbia and kosovo at the start last month of a final round of talks on the future of kosovo for the time being , the 27 eu countries " can only prepare as much as they can so that when the time comes they can be as efficient , clear and precise as possible , " the diplomat said . " i hope and i wish that the two sides can show a willingness to reach a compromise , " said jung . the 16,000-strong nato force in kosovo will continue to lead military operations there . the ministers , along with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , also looked at ways to improve cooperation between the eu and the western alliance . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

the european union launched a new fundamental rights agency in vienna on thursday .
will it prove to be another bureaucratic toothless tiger , as critics wonder , or can the bureau effectively pack a punch ? asylum , anti-semitism , xenophobia , freedom of movement , data protection , discrimination - this is the to-do list for the european union 's new fundamental rights agency . the organization is there to do research , write reports and raise awareness .
legal action is out of the question . the best case scenario is that the agency will be attentive and offer helpful warnings and admonishments , said hannes tretter from the boltzmann institute for human rights in vienna .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 01.03.2007 claims that clergy spied for communists upset polish readers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop stanislaw wielgus resigned over accusations of involvement with the polish secret police a controversial book exploring the link between poland ’ s clergy and the secret police under communism has hit polish book stores .
some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .
he later made a public confession . some priests forced to spy in one of his rare interviews , father isakowicz zaleski explained the motivation behind his book .
using a quote from a poem he wrote , he said that , in a world full of people who do not respect christian values , it is his duty to come out with the truth to reach out to ordinary polish roman catholics . the church , he stressed , must confess and repent in order to heal old wounds . church sources admit that some 10 percent of polish priests were once involved in collaboration with the secret police , many of them having been coerced into serving the communist state . normalization will take time there have been few official reactions to the publication from polish church circles , apart from a statement by józef kloch , spokesman for the polish episcopate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church must confess and repent , said father isakowicz zaleski " one needs time to fully digest the facts contained in the book , " said kloch .
" if one acts hastily , one ends up with sensational media headlines based on randomly selected facts taken out of context , " he added . father adam boniecki , publisher of a liberal catholic weekly , said he believed the present crisis may be painful , but that it would eventually lead to a more normal relationship between the church and its followers , based on a sound understanding of the past . some question political motives according to british catholic journalist bill foreman , who lives in warsaw , the book ’ s publication and the recent spy scandal involving archbishop wielgus have deepened divisions within the polish roman catholic community . while many ordinary polish roman catholics welcome the arrival of the book , some question the author ’ s motives as political .
critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .

critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

" the favorable developments of the past few months are continuing .
the employment trend is gaining momentum , " weise said . adjusted for the usual seasonal effects , the german jobless total was down even more sharply , falling by 79,000 to 3.897 million , with the adjusted jobless rate falling to 9.3 percent from 9.5 percent , separate data published by the bundesbank in frankfurt showed . the government hailed the figures .
" it 's been a long time since unemployment declined in the month of february , " said labor minister franz müntefering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering urged germans to be cautious " we 've had good news on the labor market since spring 2006 and the good news has continued this month .
the situation suggests a further improvement .
2007 could be a good year when unemployment falls sharply , " müntefering continued .
but he cautioned : " there 's no cause for celebration yet .
a lot of hard work is still necessary . " analysts were also pleased by the latest jobless statistics .

" we have an obligation to offer them a perspective to get closer to the european union and eventually be members , " he said . ministers agree to scale down troops in bosnia on thursday , eu defense ministers brought forward a move to cut troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . jung however declined to put a date on the departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says the eu will partially withdraw troops from bosnia " we need to look at how stability evolves in the region .
we must not jeopardize what we have gradually build up over the years , " he said . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .

" and that 's why it 's obvious that europe alone can not solve the climate problem . " merkel said it was time to act and urged government leaders to follow the recommendations of the european commission , which has called for a 20-percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 . she said the 27-member bloc needed to invest more in new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat the effects of climate change and emphasized that this was an opportunity to demonstrate leadership . " when we in europe can show that economics and ecology are compatible , then we will have demonstrated that we can combine technological leadership and innovation with our responsibility toward the rest of the world , " she said . reviving the constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch and the french said " no " to the eu constitution in 2005 merkel told parliament that germany planned to present a road map on how to proceed with the stalled eu constitution when its presidency of the european union expires at the end of june . eighteen of the 27 eu members have ratified the constitution , which french and dutch voters rejected in 2005 .
some countries , notably britain , have strong reservations about the constitution . " europe is our future , " she said , adding that problems such as environmental protection , illegal immigration , global trade and international security can not be resolved by individual states . achievements and goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto negotiations were revived last month merkel said that a summit in the german capital , which will take place in the last week of march to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding , would result in a berlin declaration , setting out past achievements and naming goals for the future . the german chancellor also vowed to push ahead with efforts to get a deal on world trade this year , saying that an agreement was urgent . " it is a priority for us to successfully reach a conclusion in the doha cycle and we are strongly committed to this , " merkel said .
" we are aware that the european union , and germany , the world 's biggest exporter , can benefit from this . " the wto negotiations , launched more than five years ago to boost commerce and reduce poverty were revived last month after being suspended last year , but there has been little visible progress so far . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu fundamental rights agency already dodging critics the european union launched a new fundamental rights agency in vienna on thursday .

" contrary to what was the case in the past , we 're no longer excluding expanding abroad via acquisitions , particularly in mobile telephony , " obermann said . the chief executive refused to rule out large-scale acquisitions , as long as they made sense and fulfilled " strict financial criteria , " he said . targeting fast-growth markets quizzed about the possible takeover targets , obermann replied : " we 're very dependent on the german , european and us markets .
but we do n't have any substantial presence in fast-growing markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could telekom be looking for indian customers ?
deutsche telekom would therefore look in that direction , he said , while refusing to name any specific country . british mobile phone giant vodafone recently moved into the indian market by buying hutchison essar for more than $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.3 billion euros -rrb- .
deutsche telekom had looked ready to embark on a major shopping spree last year when it bought austrian mobile operator , tele.ring. but since then , it has had to focus on its own problems at home caused by ferocious price competition and a massive outflux of fixed-line customers . selling assets , finding partners deutsche telekom would create financial room for manoeuvre by selling off non-strategic assets , obermann said .
up for sale were french and spanish internet access providers club internet and ya.com , as well as the t-systems media and broadcast unit , a service provider for the broadcasting and media industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom needs some cash first asked about the amount of money such divestments could raise , finance chief karl-gerhard eick said that " three billion euros could be feasible in a relatively short term . "
but the sum " could be more , " he said . the group said it also planned to sell its radio towers in germany and the united states , and the remaining shares in real estate company sireo . obermann said deutsche telekom was also on the look-out for a strategic partner for its information and communications technology unit , t-systems .
press reports have repeatedly speculated about a possible tie-up between t-systems and a foreign firm , with french groups atos origin and capgemini , or us firm eds mooted as potential partners . heavy losses due to restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom workers protested against job cuts on wednesday deutsche telekom said that fourth-quarter earnings were hit by fierce competition in its home market and heavy one-off charges . the group booked a bottom-line loss of 898 million euros in the period from october to december , compared with net profit of 991 million euros in the same period a year earlier .
the numbers were affected by restructuring charges .

contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo . in an interview with german tv program " monitor , " pierre-richard prosper , the us government 's former ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues until oct 2005 , said that german officials never contacted him about releasing kurnaz from the detention camp . " during my entire time in office , germany never showed any interest and i was the person to contact within the us government , " said prosper , who was responsible for returning guantanamo inmates to their home countries from 2002 to 2005 . german efforts to get kurnaz released ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz arriving at a parliamentary hearing in january kurnaz was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of being a terrorist and spent more than four years in detention before being released without charge from guantanamo in 2006 .
he says he was tortured and abused at the camp . german government officials have denied delaying the release of kurnaz , who has turkish citizenship , but grew up in germany .
the case is now under investigation by a parliamentary committee .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , has come under fire for his role . steinmeier has said that the schröder government repeatedly talked to us officials about the kurnaz case and lobbied for his release . pros per : kurnaz ready for release since 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosper -lrb- right -rrb- in 2005 but prosper , who left public service to work as an attorney at the beginning of the year , said he did n't know of any such conversations . " if the german government would have said : ' we want kurnaz , ' we would have immediately sat down to come to an agreement , " prosper said , according to german translations of the interview . prosper added that it was " not a secret " that kurnaz had been " considered for release " since 2002 . no us demands ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier " germany and turkey knew , or should have known , that the us was ready to talk about his release , " he said , adding that us officials were interested in reducing the number of guantanamo inmates drastically . prosper also said that us officials did not ask their german counterparts to use kurnaz as an intelligence contact in islamist groups in germany upon his release , as steinmeier has claimed . steinmeier has not commented on prosper 's statements .
he is expected to testify before the parliamentary committee on march 22 . documents withheld on thursday , the investigation by the parliamentary committee was held up as some official documents relating to murat kurnaz were delayed .
the papers are reportedly files from german domestic intelligence agency sources in bremen alleging that kurnaz had links to radical islamists . siegfried kauder , chairman of a parliament investigation committee , said he had requested the files from authorities in the northwestern city-state of bremen and had been assured weeks ago that they were on their way .
" as of today , they have not arrived at the secretariat of the committee , " the conservative politician said .
" in this situation , sensible work by the committee is impossible .

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .
" at octoshape we do n't have any animals , so it 's really not needed . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german man refuses to testify early in the morning what would you do if you were asked by the police to testify early in the morning ?

they say the early-to-rise work model is outdated . when lars johansen hears his alarm go off at 6 a.m. , there 's usually one thought that goes through his mind .
" i think , oh my god , i 'm not going to make it , " he said one recent morning in his home in elsinore , a town about an hour north of copenhagen probably most famous as the setting for shakespeare 's hamlet .
but make it he does , thanks to lots of strong coffee , and he is usually on time for his 7 a.m. work shift .
but to him and a lot of other people who dislike the morning intensely , there is still something distinctly rotten in the state of denmark .
it is a societal routine that requires people to start work or school before their brains have really begun functioning .
" i just feel that our society has moved to a point where we 're not so limited to time and space in your job , " he said , still slightly bleary-eyed .
" so i think society and the services of society have to follow . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping employees do n't do much for the company 's bottom line he has joined a group of like-minded compatriots who are lobbying for change .
called the " b-society , " the group was founded at the beginning of this year but already has around 3,000 members and has attracted a good deal of attention from the media , politicians and trade unions in denmark .
to the danes , morning haters are " b-people , " while those who bound out of bed early , immediately ready to take on the world are dubbed " a-people . "
sleep researchers have found that between 10 and 15 percent of the population falls into the a category , while between 15 and 25 percent are members of the b group .
the rest are somewhere in between .
different strokes for different folks founder camilla kring , an engineer by training whose phd was on striking a balance between work and personal life , said although b-people outnumber a-people , the world is organized around early risers .
for those who ca n't get going before 10 or 11 a.m. , or later , the first part of the work or school day can be a nightmare , or simply a drowsy blur , during which little is accomplished .
as a b-person herself , she is used to the criticism she and others like her get ­ generally involving the world " lazy . "
" but really , us b-people are just as productive as other people , just at different times , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not lazy , just productive a little later in the day kring says the current model of starting work early in the morning harks back to an agricultural era .
then when the industrial age began , shift work on the factory floor became the norm .
but farmers are a tiny minority in denmark today , and much manufacturing in this high-wage country has moved overseas .
as the danish economy moves toward a more high-tech focus , her group wants to see working hours changed too .
" in denmark we have a lot of discussions about becoming an innovation society , " she said .
" when you are working with your brain , it 's not about how many hours you work , it is about when are you most productive and when do you get ideas . "
b-certification the b-society is now compiling a list of companies it is calling " b-certified . "
to make the list , a business will have to show that it is willing to accommodate the needs of morning haters and allow them to work when they are at their best .
the group is also planning b-certification for institutions like day-care centers , schools , and even government offices which have thrown off the yoke of nine to five .
stephen alstrup remembers his own rhythm crashing into his school routine like he was hitting a brick wall .
at exam time during his university studies , he had to begin at 8 a.m. and had four hours to complete the test .
" basically i was sitting there doing nothing for the first three hours , " he said , while he waited for his synapses to start firing .
by the time he came around , he usually had less than an hour to make up the time wasted sitting at the desk in a half-slumber .
when he founded his own company , octoshape , he decided he would respect his employees ' productivity patterns .
one day recently at 11:30 a.m. during a reporter 's visit , there was only one employee at his desk - the staff 's sole a-person .
alstrup said the others generally arrive at around 12:30 or one o 'clock and work until 10:30 or 11 p.m.
selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a treat , a necessity for the later risers for alstrup , the late start brings several advantages : employees are at their desks when they are most mentally awake and they are more satisfied at work in general .
he thinks the b-society 's b-certification could be a powerful recruiting tool for employers since denmark 's low unemployment rate - four percent - has made competition for labor , especially for highly skilled professionals , very intense .
" i think if companies in denmark say ' we have a good company for b-persons , ' that will attract people out there , " he said .
if the world began to expand from the nine to five straitjacket , the b-society says , rush-hour gridlock might lessen , time spent waiting at government offices or on hold on the telephone might become shorter and the overall stress level in a stressed-out society might come down a notch , since people would n't have to rush to get to the bank before it closes at 5:30 .
alstrup says the morning is fine for some , but forcing everyone to get up at the crack of dawn is just an old habit that it is time to break .
" i mean , it just comes from an old tradition when we had to wake up with the animals , " said alstrup .
" at octoshape we do n't have any animals , so it 's really not needed . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german man refuses to testify early in the morning what would you do if you were asked by the police to testify early in the morning ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.03.2007 new eu fundamental rights agency already dodging critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the eu need another rights organization ?
the european union launched a new fundamental rights agency in vienna on thursday .
will it prove to be another bureaucratic toothless tiger , as critics wonder , or can the bureau effectively pack a punch ? asylum , anti-semitism , xenophobia , freedom of movement , data protection , discrimination - this is the to-do list for the european union 's new fundamental rights agency . the organization is there to do research , write reports and raise awareness .
legal action is out of the question . the best case scenario is that the agency will be attentive and offer helpful warnings and admonishments , said hannes tretter from the boltzmann institute for human rights in vienna . " it should keep up the public dialogue with politicians and with all those involved in a democratic , pluralistic society , " added tretter . look but do n't touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european court of human rights in strasbourg has handles human rights issues for decades with its annual reports and regular analyses , the 100-member fundamental rights agency is to draw attention to situations where eu regulations are not being observed in any of the bloc 's 27 member states . the particularly delicate topics , however , are off limits .
the agency wo n't be allowed to criticize police and judicial authorities , for example . " the eu states do n't want interference in their human rights policies , " dick oosting , director of human rights group amnesty international 's europe office , told news agency afp . oosting added that he did n't think the agency would be able to contribute much to the protection of rights in the eu because of the tight restrictions placed on its mandate . too many cooks in the kitchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis of britain is the council of europe 's secretary general the limitations place on human rights in the name of anti-terror measures , the plight of the roma in southeastern european and the devastating situation of many refugees in europe are areas where the eu agency wo n't be effective , said oosting . critics have also emphasized the redundancy of the new fundamental rights agency , as it is the council of europe in strasbourg which has traditionally been responsible for human rights in the bloc .

" we have a big advantage .
they need the parts we make but we do n't need management , " head of the works council in varel , jürgen bruns , said in a fiery speech . " praised !
betrayed !
sold ! " read the banners at the laupheim rally , referring to the bitterness many workers felt after airbus ' sunny outlook just two years ago clouded over setbacks with its a380 superjumbo jet programme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus workers are outraged by the restructuring bid airbus parent company eads triggered the protests with the announcement wednesday of its " power8 " rescue scheme to axe 10,000 jobs in germany , france , britain and spain and trim its factory network . on thursday , airbus also announced it had suspended development of the cargo version of its giant a380 superjumbo jet , but said it would continue looking for clients for the freight plane . three clients had placed orders for the airbus cargo superjumbo plane by november , but since then one has been scrapped and two others were also poised to be cancelled . " we are not stopping the program , " said an airbus spokesman .
" we are suspending development , but we will continue canvassing for business . " union anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-chief executive louis gallois germany 's powerful ig metall trade union for the engineering and metal-working industries vowed to fight the sale of airbus plants and protect german jobs with efforts to boost productivity and create more flexible work contracts . the head of the union 's northern chapter , jutta blankau , announced a european-wide protest movement against the restructuring plan . " we hope to mobilize employees across europe in the next 14 days , " blankau said .
" we have spoken with trade unions in the other countries " where airbus has plants . " " we oppose any sell-off or closure of a plant .
our slogan is if one is affected , all are affected , " she said . bildunterschrift : the head of the works council for the seven airbus plants in germany , rüdiger lütjens , said the decision to slash jobs and trim the network of plants in europe made little sense . " our orders list is full , which shows how popular our products are .
we do not understand why plants need to be sold , " he said . under the restructuring plans , two of the seven german sites - laupheim and varel - are to be sold , while an industrial partner will be sought for nordenham . political support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german airbus plant in varel is to be sold the northern state of lower saxony threw its weight behind the employees .
although he welcomed the plans in principle wednesday , state premier christian wulff promised thursday to fight job cuts in his state . " we reject airbus ' plans to abandon its plants , " he said . chancellor angela merkel said wednesday that germany could have been hit harder if it were not for her government 's efforts , in comments echoed by local leaders thursday . airbus plans to slash jobs across europe in the next four years , with 4,300 cuts in france , 3,700 in germany , 1,600 in britain and 400 in spain . originally , germany had feared that up to 8,000 of its jobs could be on the line .
airbus 's seven german sites currently employ a workforce of around 21,000 . a hot potato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus was the subject of a satirical float at the rose monday carnival parade in mainz the berlin daily der tagesspiegel said that airbus had become a political hot potato , overriding the powers of its chief executive louis gallois . " airbus is becoming an issue in the french election campaign , " it said in an editorial .
" an economically effective overhaul is impossible under these circumstances . " the munich-based newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , however , said it was wise for airbus to gird itself for tougher times . " it is good for the company to undergo a restructuring and cut costs now during an unprecedented boom in the aircraft manufacturing industry , " it said . " only then will airbus survive the inevitable downturn . " international balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for economic affairs , michael glos , left parity in cutting jobs had been requested by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel at a meeting between the heads of state last friday . merkel said on wednesday that the " principle of fair distribution " appeared to have been respected in the restructuring plan for european aircraft maker airbus . germany 's economy minister michael glos said the restructuring plan offered a " good basis " for the future of airbus . " we all agreed that this is about securing the long-term future of company and of a great european project , " he told reporters .
" from my point of view , today 's decision was a good basis for this .
i also think that the distribution of burdens looks balanced . " a turnaround in fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at an airbus plant in hamburg the european planemaker is expected to report an operating loss for 2006 , a sharp turnaround in its fortunes after years of bumper profits .
it also faces pressure from a weakening dollar , which makes airbus airliners more expensive in international markets .

" union anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-chief executive louis gallois germany 's powerful ig metall trade union for the engineering and metal-working industries vowed to fight the sale of airbus plants and protect german jobs with efforts to boost productivity and create more flexible work contracts . the head of the union 's northern chapter , jutta blankau , announced a european-wide protest movement against the restructuring plan . " we hope to mobilize employees across europe in the next 14 days , " blankau said .
" we have spoken with trade unions in the other countries " where airbus has plants . " " we oppose any sell-off or closure of a plant .
our slogan is if one is affected , all are affected , " she said . bildunterschrift : the head of the works council for the seven airbus plants in germany , rüdiger lütjens , said the decision to slash jobs and trim the network of plants in europe made little sense . " our orders list is full , which shows how popular our products are .

" airbus is becoming an issue in the french election campaign , " it said in an editorial .
" an economically effective overhaul is impossible under these circumstances . " the munich-based newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , however , said it was wise for airbus to gird itself for tougher times . " it is good for the company to undergo a restructuring and cut costs now during an unprecedented boom in the aircraft manufacturing industry , " it said . " only then will airbus survive the inevitable downturn . " international balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for economic affairs , michael glos , left parity in cutting jobs had been requested by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel at a meeting between the heads of state last friday . merkel said on wednesday that the " principle of fair distribution " appeared to have been respected in the restructuring plan for european aircraft maker airbus . germany 's economy minister michael glos said the restructuring plan offered a " good basis " for the future of airbus . " we all agreed that this is about securing the long-term future of company and of a great european project , " he told reporters .
" from my point of view , today 's decision was a good basis for this .

" the plan will make airbus better prepared to face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , increased competitive pressure , the financial burden related to the a380 delays , as well as to meet its other future investment needs , " airbus said in a statement . airbus is owned by eads , which is controlled by french shareholders media group lagardere and the french state , and german shareholder car maker daimlerchrysler .

" we have an obligation to offer them a perspective to get closer to the european union and eventually be members , " he said . ministers agree to scale down troops in bosnia on thursday , eu defense ministers brought forward a move to cut troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . jung however declined to put a date on the departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says the eu will partially withdraw troops from bosnia " we need to look at how stability evolves in the region .
we must not jeopardize what we have gradually build up over the years , " he said . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " he also urged bosnia to continue with its police reforms . britain to pull out all troops on wednesday , the outgoing head of the eu military staff , lieutenant general jean-paul perruche , said the troop reduction would take " three or four months " but that the force would be able to do a quick about face if trouble arose . cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . britain thursday announced the withdrawal of all its 600 troops from bosnia amid opposition claims it was being forced to " scratch around " for extra manpower to send to afghanistan . the eu is likely to send 400 people to kosovo to " help the kosovars maintain order , " said an eu diplomat , once the future status of the serbian province becomes clear . but the european union requires a united nations mandate to deploy and replace the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , and it is expected to take some time before a security council resolution can be drawn up . " unmik remains fully in charge until un security council resolution 1244 is replaced by another -lrb- resolution -rrb- , which should provide a clear mandate for the future international presence , " solana said . kosovo future remains uncertain serbian and kosovo authorities are at loggerheads over how much autonomy the province should be granted , and russia is threatening to use its security council veto to block any attempt to impose independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates from serbia and kosovo at the start last month of a final round of talks on the future of kosovo for the time being , the 27 eu countries " can only prepare as much as they can so that when the time comes they can be as efficient , clear and precise as possible , " the diplomat said . " i hope and i wish that the two sides can show a willingness to reach a compromise , " said jung . the 16,000-strong nato force in kosovo will continue to lead military operations there . the ministers , along with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , also looked at ways to improve cooperation between the eu and the western alliance . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .

critics point out that the latest revelations about key church figures coincide with what some regard as a controversial campaign championed by poland ’ s conservative nationalist government , aimed at removing all post-communist influence . since legislation concerning the vetting of public figures for links with the former secret services has not yet come into force , accusations have been made that people are being randomly picked for public humiliation before due process starts . dw staff -lrb- rk / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reparations bill for secret police victims runs into protest new legislation aimed at compensating those who suffered imprisonment under the east german communist regime has been criticized by victims ' groups , who say it does n't go far enough .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place . entitled " priests in the face of the security services , " a recently published book by father tadeusz isakowicz zaleski names around 30 polish clergymen who allegedly acted as spies during the communist period . the publication is the latest in a series of accusations against the polish catholic church for being reluctant to face up to the past complicity of some of its members with the communist regime . author banned from speaking out isakowicz zaleski was himself a victim of communist oppression and has claimed that he was silenced by some powerful church leaders in poland , who he says preferred to sweep the matter under the rug . in fact , father isakowicz zaleski was banned from making public statements when he announced his intention to publish the results of his research . the book names and shames such prominent figures as archbishop juliusz petz of poznan , who is portrayed as a willing collaborator . petz denies the allegations .
however , his name recently appeared in the media during another scandal that involved the molestation of boys in a church-sponsored choir . the book ’ s publication follows the much publicized resignation of archbishop stanislaw wielgus , who was recently forced to step down from the post of archbishop of warsaw after his name was discovered on a list of communist agents .
he later made a public confession . some priests forced to spy in one of his rare interviews , father isakowicz zaleski explained the motivation behind his book .
using a quote from a poem he wrote , he said that , in a world full of people who do not respect christian values , it is his duty to come out with the truth to reach out to ordinary polish roman catholics . the church , he stressed , must confess and repent in order to heal old wounds . church sources admit that some 10 percent of polish priests were once involved in collaboration with the secret police , many of them having been coerced into serving the communist state . normalization will take time there have been few official reactions to the publication from polish church circles , apart from a statement by józef kloch , spokesman for the polish episcopate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church must confess and repent , said father isakowicz zaleski " one needs time to fully digest the facts contained in the book , " said kloch .

" we have an obligation to offer them a perspective to get closer to the european union and eventually be members , " he said . ministers agree to scale down troops in bosnia on thursday , eu defense ministers brought forward a move to cut troop numbers in bosnia to around 2,500 this year from 6,500 now , as security in the former hotspot improves . " as a first step , we want to withdraw around 3,500 soldiers , then watch what happens before we move on , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung , who hosted the gathering . jung however declined to put a date on the departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says the eu will partially withdraw troops from bosnia " we need to look at how stability evolves in the region .
we must not jeopardize what we have gradually build up over the years , " he said . in december , eu foreign ministers noted that security in bosnia had evolved enough to permit them to " decide in principle on a transition " to lower troop numbers . " the situation in bosnia is way better .
security is going very well , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana , but he added : " politically there are still a lot of things to do . " he also urged bosnia to continue with its police reforms . britain to pull out all troops on wednesday , the outgoing head of the eu military staff , lieutenant general jean-paul perruche , said the troop reduction would take " three or four months " but that the force would be able to do a quick about face if trouble arose . cutting the size of eufor in bosnia will free up forces for use elsewhere as peacekeeping and security operations abound . britain thursday announced the withdrawal of all its 600 troops from bosnia amid opposition claims it was being forced to " scratch around " for extra manpower to send to afghanistan . the eu is likely to send 400 people to kosovo to " help the kosovars maintain order , " said an eu diplomat , once the future status of the serbian province becomes clear . but the european union requires a united nations mandate to deploy and replace the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- , and it is expected to take some time before a security council resolution can be drawn up . " unmik remains fully in charge until un security council resolution 1244 is replaced by another -lrb- resolution -rrb- , which should provide a clear mandate for the future international presence , " solana said . kosovo future remains uncertain serbian and kosovo authorities are at loggerheads over how much autonomy the province should be granted , and russia is threatening to use its security council veto to block any attempt to impose independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates from serbia and kosovo at the start last month of a final round of talks on the future of kosovo for the time being , the 27 eu countries " can only prepare as much as they can so that when the time comes they can be as efficient , clear and precise as possible , " the diplomat said . " i hope and i wish that the two sides can show a willingness to reach a compromise , " said jung . the 16,000-strong nato force in kosovo will continue to lead military operations there . the ministers , along with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , also looked at ways to improve cooperation between the eu and the western alliance . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

the icm phone poll also suggests 3 may 's vote could see another low turnout .
when it came to the recognition factor , only first minister rhodri morgan scored well , with 43 % able to name him .
just 7 % could name plaid leader ieuan wyn jones , and only 6 % recognised tory leader nick bourne or his welsh liberal democrat counterpart mike german .
it appears that despite all of the main political parties campaigning hard since last autumn , only half of people polled were even aware that there was an election in may .
the recognition was stronger in key battlegrounds such as blaenau gwent and conwy and lowest in cardiff , bridgend and the border county of flintshire .
another worry for the parties was the suggestion that only 40 % were certain to vote , with the figure rising to 60 % who were either likely , very likely or certain to vote .

more than 80 % of people said the departure of tony blair from downing street ahead of the election would not make a difference to their vote .
the poll suggested a " bounce " of about + 7 % for labour if the prime minister went .

a massive dust plume , estimated to be 150 miles -lrb- 240km -rrb- high , can be seen erupting from io 's tvashtar volcano .
on wednesday , the us probe flew by jupiter , using the planet 's gravity to boost its speed , reducing the travel time to its ultimate target of pluto .
new horizons also took photos of the icy moons europa and ganymede in the run-up to its encounter with jupiter .
turning its cameras to the giant planet itself , the spacecraft captured an image of jupiter 's little red spot , a nascent storm south of the famous great red spot .
volcanic fallout new horizons made its closest approach to jupiter at 0543 gmt -lrb- 1243 est -rrb- on wednesday , passing within 2.3 million km -lrb- 1.4 million miles -rrb- of the planet .
red jr is a swirling storm in jupiter 's atmosphere the gravity " kick " will accelerate the probe 's speed by 14,000kmph -lrb- 9,000mph -rrb- .
the probe will carry out more than 700 observations of the jupiter system by june , in a dry run for its planned rendezvous with pluto and its moons in 2015 .
the pictures of io provide the best glimpse yet of tvashtar , one of the most active volcanoes on io .
the volcano can be seen in the " 11 o 'clock " position in the images .
it is surrounded by a dark patch the size of texas consisting of the fallout from the eruption .
the probe 's observations of icy moons like europa and ganymede will allow scientists to map their surface features and composition .
subsurface ocean europa is an attractive target ; planetary scientists consider it one of the best places in the solar system to find extraterrestrial life forms .
europa is a promising target in the search for extraterrestrial life beneath its outer shell of ice , the moon is thought to host an ocean of water warmed by heat from the interior .
the little red spot , or red jr , is a swirling storm that formed from three smaller features between 1998 and 2000 .
its larger counterpart , the great red spot , is jupiter 's most famous feature .
it has been in existence for at least 130 years .
after an eight year cruise across , new horizons will conduct a five-month study of pluto and its three moons in 2015 , characterising their geology , structure and composition .

however , although sales in germany fell by 5 % for the year , internationally they were 13.6 % higher .
the firm has issued two profit warnings over the past six months , as it faces rivalry in germany 's fixed-line market .
an increasing number of companies in germany are offering discounted broadband deals , making it harder for the former state monopoly to survive .
late in january , the firm said it expected profits of 19bn euros -lrb- $ 24.5bn ; £ 12.5bn -rrb- , after an earlier estimate of between 19.7bn euros and 20.2bn euros in 2007 .
the shortfall was due to " extremely tough domestic competitive environment " as well as " the developments in foreign exchange rates " , the company said at the time .
the firm 's new chief executive , rene oberman , is expected to reveal how deutsche telekom , whose businesses also include t-mobile uk and t-mobile usa , is going to become more competitive later on thursday .

the owner of bank of scotland , hbos , saw its annual pre-tax profits rise by almost a fifth to £ 5.7bn on wednesday .
on thursday , its historic rival , the royal bank of scotland -lrb- rbs -rrb- , announced pre-tax profits of £ 9.2 .
hbos announced profits of £ 5.7bn to put it another way , if the costs of the london olympics reach £ 8bn as some critics fear then the profits of hbos and rbs could pay for them twice over .
however , whether or not this is something to celebrate polarises opinion .
a wide gulf exists between the banks ' supporters and detractors .
in the scottish business community , the success of hbos and rbs is a source of pride .
rbs in particular is seen as a world class scottish company - what was a modest regional bank is now a big hitter globally .
bank charging yet some customers and campaigners feel very differently .
the senior managers at hbos and rbs would need to lead very sheltered lives not to detect a certain unease in some quarters over the huge amount they are making .
the criticisms vary .
for some campaigners the issue is bank charging - the surcharges for unplanned overdrafts or the difficulty in finding a cash machine which is free to use in rural or deprived areas .
for others , it may be a concern over how they believe banks treat poorer or more vulnerable customers .
sometimes there may be a specific issue .
the collapse of farepak left some people blaming its bankers farepak campaigners blamed hbos for the collapse of the christmas savings scheme after the company pulled the plug on the parent firm 's overdraft .
yes , hbos may have donated £ 2m to help farepak victims - but , campaigners claim , this is pocket money for a company making £ 15m a day .
however , to the banks ' supporters rbs and hbos are all-too-rare examples of world-class companies with their headquarters in scotland .
both the banks make most of their profits outside scotland , much of it from business customers .
and - as with any major business - a high proportion of their profits go to the treasury in taxation , helping to pay for schools , hospitals and other public services .
if the banks ' successes help keep the investors happy , it 's good news for the people who invest our pension funds .
supporters warn that if rbs and hbos were n't so successful they could fall victim to a takeover and end up as branch offices of companies based outside the uk - just like the clydesdale bank , which is part of the national australia bank group .
when banks make big profits , everyone that has a pension benefits due to the boost the stock market receives john , edinburgh have your say at a time when a spanish company is set to buy scottish power , highly profitable scottish companies , they say , are to be cherished .
rbs realised it was kill or be killed .
in the late 1980s it took its first major step overseas .
high street branches of the royal bank of scotland form the symbolic heart of a global empire with interests in the united states and china , not to mention other successful operations such as direct line insurance .
the bank took on its present scale when it bought the english bank natwest in 2000 .
the bank , in its various incarnations , has more branches across the world than the coffee shop starbucks .
rbs took over natwest in 2000 hbos was formed by the bank of scotland 's merger with the former building society the halifax soon after rbs bought the natwest .
while many of the very top jobs are south of the border - and some critics claim that in many respects it seemed as though the halifax had taken over the bank of scotland - the company is still proud of its world famous headquarters on the mound .
it is a major contributor to both the scottish economy and edinburgh 's financial services industry .
some supporters wonder if the real challenge for rbs and hbos - and indeed the big banks based south of the border - is to communicate their success more effectively to the wider public .
to help customers understand how their huge profits are actually being generated and what would happen otherwise .
they say it 's important to separate the issue of profitability from what may or may not be the legitimate complaints of customers .
who , they wonder , would trust their savings to a bank which is losing money ?
account holders it is certainly true that some customers feel a certain lethargy or anxiety when it comes to changing banks .
they fear problems with standing orders or that it would simply be too much hassle .
the reality is all the major banks are keen to attract new customers and say they will do what they can to ease the process .
some even offer incentives to new account holders .
consumer groups urge savers and borrowers to shop around for the best deals and make sure that their custom is not taken for granted .
however we feel about the big banks , it is a fact that competition only works if consumers are prepared to flex their muscles - and by looking around for the best deals and taking action if we feel unhappy , we can all help to keep the big banks on their toes .

the owner of bank of scotland , hbos , saw its annual pre-tax profits rise by almost a fifth to £ 5.7bn on wednesday .
on thursday , its historic rival , the royal bank of scotland -lrb- rbs -rrb- , announced pre-tax profits of £ 9.2 .
hbos announced profits of £ 5.7bn to put it another way , if the costs of the london olympics reach £ 8bn as some critics fear then the profits of hbos and rbs could pay for them twice over .
however , whether or not this is something to celebrate polarises opinion .
a wide gulf exists between the banks ' supporters and detractors .
in the scottish business community , the success of hbos and rbs is a source of pride .
rbs in particular is seen as a world class scottish company - what was a modest regional bank is now a big hitter globally .
bank charging yet some customers and campaigners feel very differently .
the senior managers at hbos and rbs would need to lead very sheltered lives not to detect a certain unease in some quarters over the huge amount they are making .
the criticisms vary .
for some campaigners the issue is bank charging - the surcharges for unplanned overdrafts or the difficulty in finding a cash machine which is free to use in rural or deprived areas .
for others , it may be a concern over how they believe banks treat poorer or more vulnerable customers .
sometimes there may be a specific issue .
the collapse of farepak left some people blaming its bankers farepak campaigners blamed hbos for the collapse of the christmas savings scheme after the company pulled the plug on the parent firm 's overdraft .
yes , hbos may have donated £ 2m to help farepak victims - but , campaigners claim , this is pocket money for a company making £ 15m a day .
however , to the banks ' supporters rbs and hbos are all-too-rare examples of world-class companies with their headquarters in scotland .
both the banks make most of their profits outside scotland , much of it from business customers .
and - as with any major business - a high proportion of their profits go to the treasury in taxation , helping to pay for schools , hospitals and other public services .
if the banks ' successes help keep the investors happy , it 's good news for the people who invest our pension funds .
supporters warn that if rbs and hbos were n't so successful they could fall victim to a takeover and end up as branch offices of companies based outside the uk - just like the clydesdale bank , which is part of the national australia bank group .
when banks make big profits , everyone that has a pension benefits due to the boost the stock market receives john , edinburgh have your say at a time when a spanish company is set to buy scottish power , highly profitable scottish companies , they say , are to be cherished .
rbs realised it was kill or be killed .
in the late 1980s it took its first major step overseas .
high street branches of the royal bank of scotland form the symbolic heart of a global empire with interests in the united states and china , not to mention other successful operations such as direct line insurance .
the bank took on its present scale when it bought the english bank natwest in 2000 .
the bank , in its various incarnations , has more branches across the world than the coffee shop starbucks .
rbs took over natwest in 2000 hbos was formed by the bank of scotland 's merger with the former building society the halifax soon after rbs bought the natwest .
while many of the very top jobs are south of the border - and some critics claim that in many respects it seemed as though the halifax had taken over the bank of scotland - the company is still proud of its world famous headquarters on the mound .
it is a major contributor to both the scottish economy and edinburgh 's financial services industry .
some supporters wonder if the real challenge for rbs and hbos - and indeed the big banks based south of the border - is to communicate their success more effectively to the wider public .
to help customers understand how their huge profits are actually being generated and what would happen otherwise .
they say it 's important to separate the issue of profitability from what may or may not be the legitimate complaints of customers .
who , they wonder , would trust their savings to a bank which is losing money ?
account holders it is certainly true that some customers feel a certain lethargy or anxiety when it comes to changing banks .
they fear problems with standing orders or that it would simply be too much hassle .

it said that legislation making it practically illegal to trade in the us - where it had generated 75 % of its earnings - had proved a " bitter blow " .
profits were $ 138.9m -lrb- £ 70.8m -rrb- - after the firm spent $ 250.4m on reorganising costs - mainly after the us ruling .
however , business elsewhere was in " excellent shape " , it said .
illegal like other gaming firms including 888.com and sportingbet , gibraltar-based partygaming withdrew from the us and began focusing on other markets .
in october , president george w bush signed the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act - making it , in effect , illegal for firms to collect money there .
total revenue from its websites - which include partygammon.com and empirepoker.com as well as the partygaming brand , was up 13 % to $ 1.1bn -lrb- £ 561m -rrb- .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- pressure grows against khat trade bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 1 march 2007 , 08:46 gmt pressure grows against khat trade by noel mwakugu bbc news website , nairobi for decades , khat , or miraa as it is popularly known across east africa , has been the lifeline for farmers in eastern kenya , but pressure to convince them to abandon the trade is now mounting .
the growing numbers of young adults chewing the mild stimulant has become a major concern among anti-drugs campaigners who fear dependency could ruin a generation .
some 30 tonnes of khat are harvested each day by both small- and large-scale khat farmers who cultivate the crop in meru district .
most of the crop is consumed in kenya , but some is exported to somalia and united kingdom .
somalia traders say some 3,000kg of khat are flown to somalia 's capital everyday where its chewing has become the norm at social gatherings across mogadishu .
photo gallery some blame it for somalia 's misfortunes .
during islamist rule last year it was banned and the streets were the calmest for decades , but there was resistance .
most militiamen have a high dependence on the stimulant and it is argued that it causes them to be irrational and easily provoked .
when the islamist militia seized a consignment worth about $ 40,000 and set it on fire to mark the beginning of the ban , there was a riot and a curfew had to be imposed to contain the upheaval .
but since the islamists were defeated at the turn of the year , exports of khat from kenya have resumed and so has its consumption .
kenya now the pressure to have khat banned is being stepped up in kenya , where its consumption is on the rise .
facts about khat there are two main types of khat - miraa and hereri miraa is grown mainly in kenya hereri comes from ethiopia a bundle of khat costs about £ 3 -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- in britain khat is illegal in the us and a bundle there sells for between $ 50 -lrb- £ 28 -rrb- and $ 80 -lrb- £ 41 -rrb- a survey done by the government drug watchdog , national campaign against drugs abuse , shows a big rise in new users on the coast and in the capital , nairobi .
" reports by our officers show that when a khat ban was enforced in somalia the local dealers become very aggressive and were off loading the surplus products into the local market , " the watchdog 's national co-ordinator jennifer kimani told the bbc .
now her organisation is advising the government to initiate a process where khat farmers are gradually encouraged to switch to other cash crops .
apart from the negative health effects to the user , which include loss of appetite , lack of sleep , hallucinations , mental health issues and sometimes impotence , khat is also blamed social problems .
for instance in khat-growing areas , cases of boys dropping out of school are rampant .
" boys choose to work at khat plantations or sell the stimulant instead of going to school because there they make quick money , " ms kimani says .
casual workers at a khat farm can earn up to $ 20 a shift while small-scale traders in markets across kenya may earn 10 times that in daily sales .
problems in mombasa , special restaurants , as seen in yemen , have been designated as khat joints where groups of adults converge daily to chew the shoots and chat or cut business deals . "
i have not treated anybody suffering from ailments caused by its use " dr samuel murega but women complain of the long hours their husbands spend in these joints .
imam arshad salim imam says that numerous cases have been brought before religious leaders by women who report that their husbands have abandoned their family responsibilities .
" we have women who complain that they do not get their conjugal rights because their husbands remain occupied most of the night chewing khat , " says imam salim he further notes that a lot of family income is committed to the habit at the expense of other needs like education , food and health .
for this reason , imam salim insists that the government should impose a ban on khat just like neighbouring tanzania where it illegal to sell or consume the stimulant .
defence but dr samuel murega , a medic and khat farmer in maua , eastern kenya , believes calls to ban the stimulant are misguided .
instead of banning the plant , he thinks the government should license and encourage its growth .
he also denies negative health claims .
" i run an active health clinic here ... but i have not treated anybody suffering from ailments caused by its use , " says dr murega .
" some people mix khat with other narcotic drugs to get high and they end up in undesirable state .
and since they were chewing it openly then the blame goes on the stimulant and not the drugs they have taken which is unfair , " argues dr murega .
at present the trade is probably too lucrative for an imminent ban , but the remarkable changes in behaviour seen in mogadishu when khat was banned has given officials plenty of food for thought .
what do you think ?
should khat be banned ?
tell us your experiences using the postform below .
the effects of khat chewing are less than those of smoking .
therefore before considering imposing ban on khat chewing , we should ban tobacco smoking first .
secondly , it 's a major cash crop and only income earner in some parts of kenya .
myself i do n't see any problem in its consumption and i have friends who routinely chew it with no notable side effects .
peter karenju , zanzibar banning khat overnight is completely unrealistic - the reality is that many people in eastern ethiopia rely on khat production for financial support , and would suffer if they did not have this means of income .
it is true that for the many men , women and children who chew khat , it can be incredibly destructive to their health -lrb- an estimated 80 % of ' psychotic ' patients in ethiopia 's only mental hospital are the result of khat-induced psychosis -rrb- , as well as their productivity , and the health of their marriages and relationships .
but banning the addictive substance will not solve anything - if khat is eradicated , it will happen with the support of the ethiopian government , -lrb- which incidentally takes in millions in khat taxes each year -rrb- .
the government must condemn khat use and conduct research and spread public health messages about the negative health ramifications of khat , but must simultaneously support farmers and coffee growers so they do not have to rely on khat to produce a sustainable income , support education so children will have a greater incentive to go to school , rather than sell khat on the street , and support widows who are the sole bread winners of the family , so they do not have to resort to the khat trade to support their families .
only through a comprehensive approach to this region-wide addiction will there be any progress in the growing fight against khat .
elizabeth arend , jijiga , ethiopia there is no need of banning khat .
instead , the kenya government should regulate and market it as a cash crop since it has the potential of earning substantial foreign exchange .
in spite of the negative publicity it is receiving here , khat is not even listed in the handbook of recreational drugs .
as compared with synthetic and processed hard drugs like cocaine , heroine , lsd and amphetamines , khat is but a mild stimulant .
nacada has always justified its existence by spreading alarmist messages and recommending solutions that are not only impractical , but also out of touch with reality .
kipkoriony rutto , matsuyama , japan maybe we can liken the propensity to chew khat to the huge appetite for beer in the western world .
which is the better of the two evils ?
at least khat is not manufactured .
temperance , however , would be an essential if not critical element here to consider .
larry whyte , kingston , jamaica having lived in ethiopia i enjoyed the ceremony surrounding khat consumption .
it was nice for the community to somewhat shut down on saturday afternoon and sit with friends to enjoy their company .
understanding that there are other issues , why not look at the level of cigarette consumption in africa countries , or better yet , alcohol .
those are far greater problems .
ds , us for me it 's good news if it 's true that miraa is about to be banned .
it is the major source of social problem in mombas , kenya as well in yemen .
i personally saw from my father .
he would chew khat the whole night and sleep during the day .
and when he woke up every body was his enemy till he got another supply and life went on like that .
a huge loss to the family income .

the growing numbers of young adults chewing the mild stimulant has become a major concern among anti-drugs campaigners who fear dependency could ruin a generation .
some 30 tonnes of khat are harvested each day by both small- and large-scale khat farmers who cultivate the crop in meru district .
most of the crop is consumed in kenya , but some is exported to somalia and united kingdom .
somalia traders say some 3,000kg of khat are flown to somalia 's capital everyday where its chewing has become the norm at social gatherings across mogadishu .
photo gallery in pictures : growing khat widow turns to khat some blame it for somalia 's misfortunes .
during islamist rule last year it was banned and the streets were the calmest for decades , but there was resistance .
most militiamen have a high dependence on the stimulant and it is argued that it causes them to be irrational and easily provoked .
when the islamist militia seized a consignment worth about $ 40,000 and set it on fire to mark the beginning of the ban , there was a riot and a curfew had to be imposed to contain the upheaval .
but since the islamists were defeated at the turn of the year , exports of khat from kenya have resumed and so has its consumption .
kenya now the pressure to have khat banned is being stepped up in kenya , where its consumption is on the rise .
facts about khat there are two main types of khat - miraa and hereri miraa is grown mainly in kenya hereri comes from ethiopia a bundle of khat costs about £ 3 -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- in britain khat is illegal in the us and a bundle there sells for between $ 50 -lrb- £ 28 -rrb- and $ 80 -lrb- £ 41 -rrb- a survey done by the government drug watchdog , national campaign against drugs abuse , shows a big rise in new users on the coast and in the capital , nairobi .
" reports by our officers show that when a khat ban was enforced in somalia the local dealers become very aggressive and were off loading the surplus products into the local market , " the watchdog 's national co-ordinator jennifer kimani told the bbc .
now her organisation is advising the government to initiate a process where khat farmers are gradually encouraged to switch to other cash crops .
apart from the negative health effects to the user , which include loss of appetite , lack of sleep , hallucinations , mental health issues and sometimes impotence , khat is also blamed social problems .
for instance in khat-growing areas , cases of boys dropping out of school are rampant .
" boys choose to work at khat plantations or sell the stimulant instead of going to school because there they make quick money , " ms kimani says .
casual workers at a khat farm can earn up to $ 20 a shift while small-scale traders in markets across kenya may earn 10 times that in daily sales .
problems in mombasa , special restaurants , as seen in yemen , have been designated as khat joints where groups of adults converge daily to chew the shoots and chat or cut business deals .
i have not treated anybody suffering from ailments caused by its use dr samuel murega but women complain of the long hours their husbands spend in these joints .
imam arshad salim imam says that numerous cases have been brought before religious leaders by women who report that their husbands have abandoned their family responsibilities .
" we have women who complain that they do not get their conjugal rights because their husbands remain occupied most of the night chewing khat , " says imam salim he further notes that a lot of family income is committed to the habit at the expense of other needs like education , food and health .
for this reason , imam salim insists that the government should impose a ban on khat just like neighbouring tanzania where it illegal to sell or consume the stimulant .
defence but dr samuel murega , a medic and khat farmer in maua , eastern kenya , believes calls to ban the stimulant are misguided .
instead of banning the plant , he thinks the government should license and encourage its growth .
he also denies negative health claims .
" i run an active health clinic here ... but i have not treated anybody suffering from ailments caused by its use , " says dr murega .
" some people mix khat with other narcotic drugs to get high and they end up in undesirable state .
and since they were chewing it openly then the blame goes on the stimulant and not the drugs they have taken which is unfair , " argues dr murega .
at present the trade is probably too lucrative for an imminent ban , but the remarkable changes in behaviour seen in mogadishu when khat was banned has given officials plenty of food for thought .
what do you think ?
should khat be banned ?
tell us your experiences using the postform below .
the effects of khat chewing are less than those of smoking .
therefore before considering imposing ban on khat chewing , we should ban tobacco smoking first .
secondly , it 's a major cash crop and only income earner in some parts of kenya .
myself i do n't see any problem in its consumption and i have friends who routinely chew it with no notable side effects .
peter karenju , zanzibar banning khat overnight is completely unrealistic - the reality is that many people in eastern ethiopia rely on khat production for financial support , and would suffer if they did not have this means of income .
it is true that for the many men , women and children who chew khat , it can be incredibly destructive to their health -lrb- an estimated 80 % of ' psychotic ' patients in ethiopia 's only mental hospital are the result of khat-induced psychosis -rrb- , as well as their productivity , and the health of their marriages and relationships .
but banning the addictive substance will not solve anything - if khat is eradicated , it will happen with the support of the ethiopian government , -lrb- which incidentally takes in millions in khat taxes each year -rrb- .
the government must condemn khat use and conduct research and spread public health messages about the negative health ramifications of khat , but must simultaneously support farmers and coffee growers so they do not have to rely on khat to produce a sustainable income , support education so children will have a greater incentive to go to school , rather than sell khat on the street , and support widows who are the sole bread winners of the family , so they do not have to resort to the khat trade to support their families .
only through a comprehensive approach to this region-wide addiction will there be any progress in the growing fight against khat .
elizabeth arend , jijiga , ethiopia there is no need of banning khat .
instead , the kenya government should regulate and market it as a cash crop since it has the potential of earning substantial foreign exchange .
in spite of the negative publicity it is receiving here , khat is not even listed in the handbook of recreational drugs .
as compared with synthetic and processed hard drugs like cocaine , heroine , lsd and amphetamines , khat is but a mild stimulant .
nacada has always justified its existence by spreading alarmist messages and recommending solutions that are not only impractical , but also out of touch with reality .
kipkoriony rutto , matsuyama , japan maybe we can liken the propensity to chew khat to the huge appetite for beer in the western world .
which is the better of the two evils ?
at least khat is not manufactured .
temperance , however , would be an essential if not critical element here to consider .
larry whyte , kingston , jamaica having lived in ethiopia i enjoyed the ceremony surrounding khat consumption .
it was nice for the community to somewhat shut down on saturday afternoon and sit with friends to enjoy their company .
understanding that there are other issues , why not look at the level of cigarette consumption in africa countries , or better yet , alcohol .
those are far greater problems .
ds , us for me it 's good news if it 's true that miraa is about to be banned .
it is the major source of social problem in mombas , kenya as well in yemen .
i personally saw from my father .
he would chew khat the whole night and sleep during the day .
and when he woke up every body was his enemy till he got another supply and life went on like that .
a huge loss to the family income .

the growing numbers of young adults chewing the mild stimulant has become a major concern among anti-drugs campaigners who fear dependency could ruin a generation .
some 30 tonnes of khat are harvested each day by both small- and large-scale khat farmers who cultivate the crop in meru district .
most of the crop is consumed in kenya , but some is exported to somalia and united kingdom .
somalia traders say some 3,000kg of khat are flown to somalia 's capital everyday where its chewing has become the norm at social gatherings across mogadishu .

imam arshad salim imam says that numerous cases have been brought before religious leaders by women who report that their husbands have abandoned their family responsibilities .
" we have women who complain that they do not get their conjugal rights because their husbands remain occupied most of the night chewing khat , " says imam salim he further notes that a lot of family income is committed to the habit at the expense of other needs like education , food and health .
for this reason , imam salim insists that the government should impose a ban on khat just like neighbouring tanzania where it illegal to sell or consume the stimulant .
defence but dr samuel murega , a medic and khat farmer in maua , eastern kenya , believes calls to ban the stimulant are misguided .
instead of banning the plant , he thinks the government should license and encourage its growth .
he also denies negative health claims .
" i run an active health clinic here ... but i have not treated anybody suffering from ailments caused by its use , " says dr murega .
" some people mix khat with other narcotic drugs to get high and they end up in undesirable state .
and since they were chewing it openly then the blame goes on the stimulant and not the drugs they have taken which is unfair , " argues dr murega .
at present the trade is probably too lucrative for an imminent ban , but the remarkable changes in behaviour seen in mogadishu when khat was banned has given officials plenty of food for thought .
what do you think ?
should khat be banned ?
tell us your experiences using the postform below .
the effects of khat chewing are less than those of smoking .
therefore before considering imposing ban on khat chewing , we should ban tobacco smoking first .
secondly , it 's a major cash crop and only income earner in some parts of kenya .
myself i do n't see any problem in its consumption and i have friends who routinely chew it with no notable side effects .
peter karenju , zanzibar banning khat overnight is completely unrealistic - the reality is that many people in eastern ethiopia rely on khat production for financial support , and would suffer if they did not have this means of income .
it is true that for the many men , women and children who chew khat , it can be incredibly destructive to their health -lrb- an estimated 80 % of ' psychotic ' patients in ethiopia 's only mental hospital are the result of khat-induced psychosis -rrb- , as well as their productivity , and the health of their marriages and relationships .
but banning the addictive substance will not solve anything - if khat is eradicated , it will happen with the support of the ethiopian government , -lrb- which incidentally takes in millions in khat taxes each year -rrb- .
the government must condemn khat use and conduct research and spread public health messages about the negative health ramifications of khat , but must simultaneously support farmers and coffee growers so they do not have to rely on khat to produce a sustainable income , support education so children will have a greater incentive to go to school , rather than sell khat on the street , and support widows who are the sole bread winners of the family , so they do not have to resort to the khat trade to support their families .
only through a comprehensive approach to this region-wide addiction will there be any progress in the growing fight against khat .
elizabeth arend , jijiga , ethiopia there is no need of banning khat .
instead , the kenya government should regulate and market it as a cash crop since it has the potential of earning substantial foreign exchange .
in spite of the negative publicity it is receiving here , khat is not even listed in the handbook of recreational drugs .
as compared with synthetic and processed hard drugs like cocaine , heroine , lsd and amphetamines , khat is but a mild stimulant .
nacada has always justified its existence by spreading alarmist messages and recommending solutions that are not only impractical , but also out of touch with reality .
kipkoriony rutto , matsuyama , japan maybe we can liken the propensity to chew khat to the huge appetite for beer in the western world .
which is the better of the two evils ?
at least khat is not manufactured .
temperance , however , would be an essential if not critical element here to consider .
larry whyte , kingston , jamaica having lived in ethiopia i enjoyed the ceremony surrounding khat consumption .
it was nice for the community to somewhat shut down on saturday afternoon and sit with friends to enjoy their company .
understanding that there are other issues , why not look at the level of cigarette consumption in africa countries , or better yet , alcohol .
those are far greater problems .
ds , us for me it 's good news if it 's true that miraa is about to be banned .
it is the major source of social problem in mombas , kenya as well in yemen .
i personally saw from my father .
he would chew khat the whole night and sleep during the day .
and when he woke up every body was his enemy till he got another supply and life went on like that .
a huge loss to the family income .

the growing numbers of young adults chewing the mild stimulant has become a major concern among anti-drugs campaigners who fear dependency could ruin a generation .
some 30 tonnes of khat are harvested each day by both small- and large-scale khat farmers who cultivate the crop in meru district .
most of the crop is consumed in kenya , but some is exported to somalia and united kingdom .
somalia traders say some 3,000kg of khat are flown to somalia 's capital everyday where its chewing has become the norm at social gatherings across mogadishu .
photo gallery in pictures : growing khat widow turns to khat some blame it for somalia 's misfortunes .
during islamist rule last year it was banned and the streets were the calmest for decades , but there was resistance .
most militiamen have a high dependence on the stimulant and it is argued that it causes them to be irrational and easily provoked .
when the islamist militia seized a consignment worth about $ 40,000 and set it on fire to mark the beginning of the ban , there was a riot and a curfew had to be imposed to contain the upheaval .
but since the islamists were defeated at the turn of the year , exports of khat from kenya have resumed and so has its consumption .
kenya now the pressure to have khat banned is being stepped up in kenya , where its consumption is on the rise .
facts about khat there are two main types of khat - miraa and hereri miraa is grown mainly in kenya hereri comes from ethiopia a bundle of khat costs about £ 3 -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- in britain khat is illegal in the us and a bundle there sells for between $ 50 -lrb- £ 28 -rrb- and $ 80 -lrb- £ 41 -rrb- a survey done by the government drug watchdog , national campaign against drugs abuse , shows a big rise in new users on the coast and in the capital , nairobi .
" reports by our officers show that when a khat ban was enforced in somalia the local dealers become very aggressive and were off loading the surplus products into the local market , " the watchdog 's national co-ordinator jennifer kimani told the bbc .
now her organisation is advising the government to initiate a process where khat farmers are gradually encouraged to switch to other cash crops .
apart from the negative health effects to the user , which include loss of appetite , lack of sleep , hallucinations , mental health issues and sometimes impotence , khat is also blamed social problems .
for instance in khat-growing areas , cases of boys dropping out of school are rampant .
" boys choose to work at khat plantations or sell the stimulant instead of going to school because there they make quick money , " ms kimani says .
casual workers at a khat farm can earn up to $ 20 a shift while small-scale traders in markets across kenya may earn 10 times that in daily sales .
problems in mombasa , special restaurants , as seen in yemen , have been designated as khat joints where groups of adults converge daily to chew the shoots and chat or cut business deals .

the situation began on wednesday evening and at one point there were no available ambulances to send to emergency calls .
it is the second time in a month that ambulances have had to queue outside the uhw because of a high volume of 999-calls and a shortage of available beds .

" its crews experienced delays as they waited to discharge their patients to the emergency unit .
" every effort was made to discharge as many patients as possible from the hospital to make room for new patients but , unfortunately , demand exceeded bed availability . "
bed shortages less than two weeks ago the welsh ambulance service declared a state of " special emergency " after record demand in cardiff and the vale in mid-february .
people were urged to dial 999 only in life-threatening cases after calls reached " unprecedented levels " .
speaking about the situation , the chairman of the british medical association 's welsh council said there would always be " peak and troughs " within the system .
dr tony calland said : " it is difficult to predict these sudden surges .
it is a capacity problem , you 've got difficulty getting people out , mainly because there are a lot more elderly people in hospital . "
he added the aging population was putting huge pressure on social services to find carers for them once they leave hospital .
" there are constraints on the nursing homes - many have had to close because they are uneconomical .
" there is pressure on social services .
there is pressure all along the line . "
some patients ' had to be transferred to nearby llandough hospital .
on monday people waited more than two hours on to be admitted to the royal glamorgan hospital in llantrisant as emergencies " overwhelmed " the hospital .
up to seven ambulances queued outside the hospital .

the film , which will focus on the early lives of captain james t kirk and mr spock , will begin shooting this autumn .
no further details have been announced and the movie has yet to be cast .
but abrams - who directed the third mission : impossible film last year - said he wanted " to make a picture for life-long fans and the uninitiated " .
" needless to say i am honoured and excited to be part of this next chapter of star trek , " he added .
' brilliance and optimism ' the original star trek tv series , created by gene roddenberry , ran from 1966 to 1969 .
it went on to spawn 10 feature films , numerous spin-offs and a billion-dollar industry of books , computer games and consumer products .

the latest feature , which has yet to be named , will tell of kirk and spock 's first meeting at starfleet academy and their first outer space mission .
alex kurtzman and roberto orci , who worked with abrams on mission : impossible iii , have written the screenplay .
" if there 's something i 'm dying to see , it 's the brilliance and optimism of roddenberry 's world brought back to the big screen , " said abrams .
" alex and bob wrote an amazing script that embraces and respects trek canon but charts its own course . "
paramount pictures chairman and ceo brad grey said he " could not be more thrilled to be back in business with jj abrams " .
as well as directing the film , abrams will co-produce with lost co-creator damon lindelof .
