köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .
meinhoff had committed suicide in 1976 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic german president köhler is under pressure after meeting with klar feedback send us an e-mail .

there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .
meinhoff had committed suicide in 1976 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic german president köhler is under pressure after meeting with klar feedback send us an e-mail .

politicians want to help parents stay one technical step ahead of their kids . at some schools in germany , it 's a daily occurrence : kids beat up fellow students just so they can record the brutality on their mobile phones .
then they use the taped violence to show off to their friends .
" a friend of mine showed me a video where they threw this guy on the ground and then they kicked him the whole time , " an unidentified student told deutsche welle .

" when the device is turned on for the first time , parents have the opportunity to turn on the child protection function , which is accessible with a pin code , " said jarzombek .
" it should be possible to set the device so that only content can be played back that is definitely appropriate for young people . "
he added that this kind of child protection setting is already possible for video games and pay-per-view television programs .
nearly every teenager in germany owns a cell phone and , according to experts , around two-thirds of all young mobile phone users have used the device to receive violent videos .
hotline for technically challenged parents jarzombek said the cell phone companies bear some of the responsibility for restricting access to videos with adult content .
germany ’ s largest mobile operator t-mobile sees it differently , however .
" the material that is exchanged - from vacation pictures and concert videos to negative content that glorifies violence - has nothing to do with t-mobile and the network technology , " said t-mobile spokeswoman ramona stahl .
" it ’ s private material and could be considered more of a social phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : videos are sent to other phones using wireless technology stahl said t-mobile offers a hotline for confused parents who do n't know how to use their children 's complicated cell phones . jarzombek said he did n't think the hotline was a sufficient solution .
kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .
do kids want to watch ?
students , however , said they doubted that parental pin codes would be effective against violent videos .
" it ’ s just like the smoking laws , " said one student .
" people tell kids under 16 they ca n't smoke , but they can still get cigarettes everywhere . "
another teenager said he was confident the child-proof function could be hacked into .
" even if 20 percent hack into it , the provision would still help 80 percent , " said jarzombek .
" young people are interested in things that are forbidden , but are more or less harmless .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .

the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .
" we now have very , very clear options on how to deal with climate change , " said stephanie tunmore , a greenpeace climate and energy campaigner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : reducing global warming wo n't derail world economy controlling global warming is economically feasible .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .

but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .
meinhoff had committed suicide in 1976 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic german president köhler is under pressure after meeting with klar feedback send us an e-mail .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .

the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.05.2007 pressure on as title race heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke need to do better than against bochum last week with three weeks left to go in the season , a pair of points is all that separates the trio at the top of the table .
none of the frontrunners schalke , stuttgart or bremen have easy opponents . schalke have the toughest foe - at least as far as the standings are concerned . coach hans meyer has had fifth-place nuremberg playing consistently well all season .
their clash with schalke pits the bundesliga 's two best defensive teams against one another , so goals could be at a premium . what 's worse for schalke , nuremberg have only lost six times - compared to 15 draws and 10 wins .
after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .
having already qualified for the uefa cup by reaching the german cup final , it does n't really matter to meyer 's minions where they end up in the table . of mainz and men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stuttgart help send another struggler down to the second division ?
stuttgart 's next foes , on the other hand , have all the motivation in the world .
second-to-last mainz are in acute danger of relegation and are sure to fight their hearts out when they visit gottlieb daimler stadium . mainz have one of the league 's hottest strikers in mohamed zidan .
the egyptian has scored 12 goals since coming from bremen during the winter break , almost single-handedly giving the team a chance to stay up and mainz fans something to talk about . the good news for stuttgart fans is that mainz are on a six-game winless streak , while stuttgart themselves have won their last five .
the hosts could also be bolstered by the long-awaited return of striker mario gomez from injury . a tour through the capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have only two days to recover from their uefa cup match on thursday on sunday , bremen travel to berlin to take on ever-enigmatic hertha .
hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .
should they lose , and schalke and stuttgart win , they would five points adrift with only two games to play . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .
" we now have very , very clear options on how to deal with climate change , " said stephanie tunmore , a greenpeace climate and energy campaigner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : reducing global warming wo n't derail world economy controlling global warming is economically feasible .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .
little progress made so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite program has not made the progress the eu commission hoped for almost two years after being named , a private french , german , spanish , british and italian consortium of industry giants has made little progress on the project , angering the commission .
the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "
in june , eu transport ministers are to re-examine the galileo project , which is aimed at breaking europe 's dependence on the free gps system used aboard many cars , boats and aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans discover " second earth " in universe the first habitable planet similar in size and conditions to the earth has been located in a distant solar system , once again raising the possibility of life on other planets , scientists revealed wednesday .

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .
meinhoff had committed suicide in 1976 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic german president köhler is under pressure after meeting with klar feedback send us an e-mail .

none of the frontrunners schalke , stuttgart or bremen have easy opponents . schalke have the toughest foe - at least as far as the standings are concerned . coach hans meyer has had fifth-place nuremberg playing consistently well all season .
their clash with schalke pits the bundesliga 's two best defensive teams against one another , so goals could be at a premium . what 's worse for schalke , nuremberg have only lost six times - compared to 15 draws and 10 wins .
after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .

stuttgart 's next foes , on the other hand , have all the motivation in the world .
second-to-last mainz are in acute danger of relegation and are sure to fight their hearts out when they visit gottlieb daimler stadium . mainz have one of the league 's hottest strikers in mohamed zidan .
the egyptian has scored 12 goals since coming from bremen during the winter break , almost single-handedly giving the team a chance to stay up and mainz fans something to talk about . the good news for stuttgart fans is that mainz are on a six-game winless streak , while stuttgart themselves have won their last five .
the hosts could also be bolstered by the long-awaited return of striker mario gomez from injury . a tour through the capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have only two days to recover from their uefa cup match on thursday on sunday , bremen travel to berlin to take on ever-enigmatic hertha .
hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .
little progress made so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite program has not made the progress the eu commission hoped for almost two years after being named , a private french , german , spanish , british and italian consortium of industry giants has made little progress on the project , angering the commission .
the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "

after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .

that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .

hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .

under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .

environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .
little progress made so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite program has not made the progress the eu commission hoped for almost two years after being named , a private french , german , spanish , british and italian consortium of industry giants has made little progress on the project , angering the commission .
the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "
in june , eu transport ministers are to re-examine the galileo project , which is aimed at breaking europe 's dependence on the free gps system used aboard many cars , boats and aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans discover " second earth " in universe the first habitable planet similar in size and conditions to the earth has been located in a distant solar system , once again raising the possibility of life on other planets , scientists revealed wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 05.05.2007 eu leads clamor for carbon cuts after un climate report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas criticized a german plan to build at least 26 new coal-fired power plants europe led demands for a deal to slash global greenhouse gas emissions after the un 's top scientific panel said early , deep cuts could avert the worst of long-term climate damage - and at a modest cost . in a statement shortly after the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- published its report on friday , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas called for a breakthrough in efforts to shape a successor to the kyoto protocol .
" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .
" we now have very , very clear options on how to deal with climate change , " said stephanie tunmore , a greenpeace climate and energy campaigner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : reducing global warming wo n't derail world economy controlling global warming is economically feasible .

the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .
" we now have very , very clear options on how to deal with climate change , " said stephanie tunmore , a greenpeace climate and energy campaigner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : reducing global warming wo n't derail world economy controlling global warming is economically feasible .
much of the technology already exists , but quick action is needed , according to the final report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc . -rrb- -lrb- 04.05.2007 -rrb- germany 's largest glacier keeps melting despite " sun screen " workers began stretching a huge tarpaulin thursday over parts of germany 's highest mountain in a battle against the effects of global warming on the snow-covered peak - a process that leaves environmentalists sceptical .

none of the frontrunners schalke , stuttgart or bremen have easy opponents . schalke have the toughest foe - at least as far as the standings are concerned . coach hans meyer has had fifth-place nuremberg playing consistently well all season .
their clash with schalke pits the bundesliga 's two best defensive teams against one another , so goals could be at a premium . what 's worse for schalke , nuremberg have only lost six times - compared to 15 draws and 10 wins .
after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .

second-to-last mainz are in acute danger of relegation and are sure to fight their hearts out when they visit gottlieb daimler stadium . mainz have one of the league 's hottest strikers in mohamed zidan .
the egyptian has scored 12 goals since coming from bremen during the winter break , almost single-handedly giving the team a chance to stay up and mainz fans something to talk about . the good news for stuttgart fans is that mainz are on a six-game winless streak , while stuttgart themselves have won their last five .

that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .

politicians want to help parents stay one technical step ahead of their kids . at some schools in germany , it 's a daily occurrence : kids beat up fellow students just so they can record the brutality on their mobile phones .
then they use the taped violence to show off to their friends .
" a friend of mine showed me a video where they threw this guy on the ground and then they kicked him the whole time , " an unidentified student told deutsche welle .
" it was pretty bad . "
parental pin code bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cell phone cameras are being used for more than kodak moments thomas jarzombek a state christian democratic union politician has developed a plan to keep brutal violence , as well as pornography , out of the hands of underage cell phone users .
" when the device is turned on for the first time , parents have the opportunity to turn on the child protection function , which is accessible with a pin code , " said jarzombek .
" it should be possible to set the device so that only content can be played back that is definitely appropriate for young people . "
he added that this kind of child protection setting is already possible for video games and pay-per-view television programs .
nearly every teenager in germany owns a cell phone and , according to experts , around two-thirds of all young mobile phone users have used the device to receive violent videos .
hotline for technically challenged parents jarzombek said the cell phone companies bear some of the responsibility for restricting access to videos with adult content .
germany ’ s largest mobile operator t-mobile sees it differently , however .
" the material that is exchanged - from vacation pictures and concert videos to negative content that glorifies violence - has nothing to do with t-mobile and the network technology , " said t-mobile spokeswoman ramona stahl .
" it ’ s private material and could be considered more of a social phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : videos are sent to other phones using wireless technology stahl said t-mobile offers a hotline for confused parents who do n't know how to use their children 's complicated cell phones . jarzombek said he did n't think the hotline was a sufficient solution .
kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .
do kids want to watch ?
students , however , said they doubted that parental pin codes would be effective against violent videos .
" it ’ s just like the smoking laws , " said one student .
" people tell kids under 16 they ca n't smoke , but they can still get cigarettes everywhere . "
another teenager said he was confident the child-proof function could be hacked into .
" even if 20 percent hack into it , the provision would still help 80 percent , " said jarzombek .
" young people are interested in things that are forbidden , but are more or less harmless .
but these videos are so extremely violent that even adults ca n't sleep at night when they 've seen them .
i don ’ t think that most kids really want to see them .

having already qualified for the uefa cup by reaching the german cup final , it does n't really matter to meyer 's minions where they end up in the table . of mainz and men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stuttgart help send another struggler down to the second division ?
stuttgart 's next foes , on the other hand , have all the motivation in the world .
second-to-last mainz are in acute danger of relegation and are sure to fight their hearts out when they visit gottlieb daimler stadium . mainz have one of the league 's hottest strikers in mohamed zidan .
the egyptian has scored 12 goals since coming from bremen during the winter break , almost single-handedly giving the team a chance to stay up and mainz fans something to talk about . the good news for stuttgart fans is that mainz are on a six-game winless streak , while stuttgart themselves have won their last five .
the hosts could also be bolstered by the long-awaited return of striker mario gomez from injury . a tour through the capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have only two days to recover from their uefa cup match on thursday on sunday , bremen travel to berlin to take on ever-enigmatic hertha .
hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .
should they lose , and schalke and stuttgart win , they would five points adrift with only two games to play . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .

politicians want to help parents stay one technical step ahead of their kids . at some schools in germany , it 's a daily occurrence : kids beat up fellow students just so they can record the brutality on their mobile phones .
then they use the taped violence to show off to their friends .
" a friend of mine showed me a video where they threw this guy on the ground and then they kicked him the whole time , " an unidentified student told deutsche welle .
" it was pretty bad . "
parental pin code bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cell phone cameras are being used for more than kodak moments thomas jarzombek a state christian democratic union politician has developed a plan to keep brutal violence , as well as pornography , out of the hands of underage cell phone users .
" when the device is turned on for the first time , parents have the opportunity to turn on the child protection function , which is accessible with a pin code , " said jarzombek .
" it should be possible to set the device so that only content can be played back that is definitely appropriate for young people . "
he added that this kind of child protection setting is already possible for video games and pay-per-view television programs .
nearly every teenager in germany owns a cell phone and , according to experts , around two-thirds of all young mobile phone users have used the device to receive violent videos .
hotline for technically challenged parents jarzombek said the cell phone companies bear some of the responsibility for restricting access to videos with adult content .
germany ’ s largest mobile operator t-mobile sees it differently , however .
" the material that is exchanged - from vacation pictures and concert videos to negative content that glorifies violence - has nothing to do with t-mobile and the network technology , " said t-mobile spokeswoman ramona stahl .
" it ’ s private material and could be considered more of a social phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : videos are sent to other phones using wireless technology stahl said t-mobile offers a hotline for confused parents who do n't know how to use their children 's complicated cell phones . jarzombek said he did n't think the hotline was a sufficient solution .
kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .
do kids want to watch ?

none of the frontrunners schalke , stuttgart or bremen have easy opponents . schalke have the toughest foe - at least as far as the standings are concerned . coach hans meyer has had fifth-place nuremberg playing consistently well all season .
their clash with schalke pits the bundesliga 's two best defensive teams against one another , so goals could be at a premium . what 's worse for schalke , nuremberg have only lost six times - compared to 15 draws and 10 wins .
after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .
having already qualified for the uefa cup by reaching the german cup final , it does n't really matter to meyer 's minions where they end up in the table . of mainz and men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stuttgart help send another struggler down to the second division ?
stuttgart 's next foes , on the other hand , have all the motivation in the world .
second-to-last mainz are in acute danger of relegation and are sure to fight their hearts out when they visit gottlieb daimler stadium . mainz have one of the league 's hottest strikers in mohamed zidan .
the egyptian has scored 12 goals since coming from bremen during the winter break , almost single-handedly giving the team a chance to stay up and mainz fans something to talk about . the good news for stuttgart fans is that mainz are on a six-game winless streak , while stuttgart themselves have won their last five .
the hosts could also be bolstered by the long-awaited return of striker mario gomez from injury . a tour through the capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have only two days to recover from their uefa cup match on thursday on sunday , bremen travel to berlin to take on ever-enigmatic hertha .
hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .
should they lose , and schalke and stuttgart win , they would five points adrift with only two games to play . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .

in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .

" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .

nearly every teenager in germany owns a cell phone and , according to experts , around two-thirds of all young mobile phone users have used the device to receive violent videos .
hotline for technically challenged parents jarzombek said the cell phone companies bear some of the responsibility for restricting access to videos with adult content .
germany ’ s largest mobile operator t-mobile sees it differently , however .
" the material that is exchanged - from vacation pictures and concert videos to negative content that glorifies violence - has nothing to do with t-mobile and the network technology , " said t-mobile spokeswoman ramona stahl .
" it ’ s private material and could be considered more of a social phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : videos are sent to other phones using wireless technology stahl said t-mobile offers a hotline for confused parents who do n't know how to use their children 's complicated cell phones . jarzombek said he did n't think the hotline was a sufficient solution .
kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .
do kids want to watch ?
students , however , said they doubted that parental pin codes would be effective against violent videos .
" it ’ s just like the smoking laws , " said one student .
" people tell kids under 16 they ca n't smoke , but they can still get cigarettes everywhere . "
another teenager said he was confident the child-proof function could be hacked into .
" even if 20 percent hack into it , the provision would still help 80 percent , " said jarzombek .
" young people are interested in things that are forbidden , but are more or less harmless .
but these videos are so extremely violent that even adults ca n't sleep at night when they 've seen them .
i don ’ t think that most kids really want to see them .

hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .
should they lose , and schalke and stuttgart win , they would five points adrift with only two games to play . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .

but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "

politicians want to help parents stay one technical step ahead of their kids . at some schools in germany , it 's a daily occurrence : kids beat up fellow students just so they can record the brutality on their mobile phones .
then they use the taped violence to show off to their friends .
" a friend of mine showed me a video where they threw this guy on the ground and then they kicked him the whole time , " an unidentified student told deutsche welle .
" it was pretty bad . "
parental pin code bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cell phone cameras are being used for more than kodak moments thomas jarzombek a state christian democratic union politician has developed a plan to keep brutal violence , as well as pornography , out of the hands of underage cell phone users .
" when the device is turned on for the first time , parents have the opportunity to turn on the child protection function , which is accessible with a pin code , " said jarzombek .
" it should be possible to set the device so that only content can be played back that is definitely appropriate for young people . "
he added that this kind of child protection setting is already possible for video games and pay-per-view television programs .
nearly every teenager in germany owns a cell phone and , according to experts , around two-thirds of all young mobile phone users have used the device to receive violent videos .
hotline for technically challenged parents jarzombek said the cell phone companies bear some of the responsibility for restricting access to videos with adult content .
germany ’ s largest mobile operator t-mobile sees it differently , however .
" the material that is exchanged - from vacation pictures and concert videos to negative content that glorifies violence - has nothing to do with t-mobile and the network technology , " said t-mobile spokeswoman ramona stahl .
" it ’ s private material and could be considered more of a social phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : videos are sent to other phones using wireless technology stahl said t-mobile offers a hotline for confused parents who do n't know how to use their children 's complicated cell phones . jarzombek said he did n't think the hotline was a sufficient solution .
kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .
do kids want to watch ?
students , however , said they doubted that parental pin codes would be effective against violent videos .
" it ’ s just like the smoking laws , " said one student .
" people tell kids under 16 they ca n't smoke , but they can still get cigarettes everywhere . "
another teenager said he was confident the child-proof function could be hacked into .
" even if 20 percent hack into it , the provision would still help 80 percent , " said jarzombek .
" young people are interested in things that are forbidden , but are more or less harmless .
but these videos are so extremely violent that even adults ca n't sleep at night when they 've seen them .
i don ’ t think that most kids really want to see them .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .
" we now have very , very clear options on how to deal with climate change , " said stephanie tunmore , a greenpeace climate and energy campaigner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : reducing global warming wo n't derail world economy controlling global warming is economically feasible .

there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .

" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 05.05.2007 politician wants cell phone lock to curb violent student videos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians and parents want to monitor how kids use their cell phones some school-age bullies are n't just picking on other students ; they 're filming the beatings with cell phones and sending the clips to friends .
politicians want to help parents stay one technical step ahead of their kids . at some schools in germany , it 's a daily occurrence : kids beat up fellow students just so they can record the brutality on their mobile phones .
then they use the taped violence to show off to their friends .
" a friend of mine showed me a video where they threw this guy on the ground and then they kicked him the whole time , " an unidentified student told deutsche welle .
" it was pretty bad . "
parental pin code bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cell phone cameras are being used for more than kodak moments thomas jarzombek a state christian democratic union politician has developed a plan to keep brutal violence , as well as pornography , out of the hands of underage cell phone users .
" when the device is turned on for the first time , parents have the opportunity to turn on the child protection function , which is accessible with a pin code , " said jarzombek .
" it should be possible to set the device so that only content can be played back that is definitely appropriate for young people . "
he added that this kind of child protection setting is already possible for video games and pay-per-view television programs .
nearly every teenager in germany owns a cell phone and , according to experts , around two-thirds of all young mobile phone users have used the device to receive violent videos .
hotline for technically challenged parents jarzombek said the cell phone companies bear some of the responsibility for restricting access to videos with adult content .
germany ’ s largest mobile operator t-mobile sees it differently , however .
" the material that is exchanged - from vacation pictures and concert videos to negative content that glorifies violence - has nothing to do with t-mobile and the network technology , " said t-mobile spokeswoman ramona stahl .
" it ’ s private material and could be considered more of a social phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : videos are sent to other phones using wireless technology stahl said t-mobile offers a hotline for confused parents who do n't know how to use their children 's complicated cell phones . jarzombek said he did n't think the hotline was a sufficient solution .
kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .
do kids want to watch ?
students , however , said they doubted that parental pin codes would be effective against violent videos .
" it ’ s just like the smoking laws , " said one student .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.05.2007 pressure on as title race heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke need to do better than against bochum last week with three weeks left to go in the season , a pair of points is all that separates the trio at the top of the table .
none of the frontrunners schalke , stuttgart or bremen have easy opponents . schalke have the toughest foe - at least as far as the standings are concerned . coach hans meyer has had fifth-place nuremberg playing consistently well all season .
their clash with schalke pits the bundesliga 's two best defensive teams against one another , so goals could be at a premium . what 's worse for schalke , nuremberg have only lost six times - compared to 15 draws and 10 wins .
after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .
having already qualified for the uefa cup by reaching the german cup final , it does n't really matter to meyer 's minions where they end up in the table . of mainz and men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stuttgart help send another struggler down to the second division ?
stuttgart 's next foes , on the other hand , have all the motivation in the world .

none of the frontrunners schalke , stuttgart or bremen have easy opponents . schalke have the toughest foe - at least as far as the standings are concerned . coach hans meyer has had fifth-place nuremberg playing consistently well all season .
their clash with schalke pits the bundesliga 's two best defensive teams against one another , so goals could be at a premium . what 's worse for schalke , nuremberg have only lost six times - compared to 15 draws and 10 wins .
after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .
little progress made so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite program has not made the progress the eu commission hoped for almost two years after being named , a private french , german , spanish , british and italian consortium of industry giants has made little progress on the project , angering the commission .
the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "
in june , eu transport ministers are to re-examine the galileo project , which is aimed at breaking europe 's dependence on the free gps system used aboard many cars , boats and aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans discover " second earth " in universe the first habitable planet similar in size and conditions to the earth has been located in a distant solar system , once again raising the possibility of life on other planets , scientists revealed wednesday .

politicians want to help parents stay one technical step ahead of their kids . at some schools in germany , it 's a daily occurrence : kids beat up fellow students just so they can record the brutality on their mobile phones .
then they use the taped violence to show off to their friends .
" a friend of mine showed me a video where they threw this guy on the ground and then they kicked him the whole time , " an unidentified student told deutsche welle .
" it was pretty bad . "
parental pin code bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cell phone cameras are being used for more than kodak moments thomas jarzombek a state christian democratic union politician has developed a plan to keep brutal violence , as well as pornography , out of the hands of underage cell phone users .
" when the device is turned on for the first time , parents have the opportunity to turn on the child protection function , which is accessible with a pin code , " said jarzombek .
" it should be possible to set the device so that only content can be played back that is definitely appropriate for young people . "
he added that this kind of child protection setting is already possible for video games and pay-per-view television programs .
nearly every teenager in germany owns a cell phone and , according to experts , around two-thirds of all young mobile phone users have used the device to receive violent videos .
hotline for technically challenged parents jarzombek said the cell phone companies bear some of the responsibility for restricting access to videos with adult content .
germany ’ s largest mobile operator t-mobile sees it differently , however .
" the material that is exchanged - from vacation pictures and concert videos to negative content that glorifies violence - has nothing to do with t-mobile and the network technology , " said t-mobile spokeswoman ramona stahl .
" it ’ s private material and could be considered more of a social phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : videos are sent to other phones using wireless technology stahl said t-mobile offers a hotline for confused parents who do n't know how to use their children 's complicated cell phones . jarzombek said he did n't think the hotline was a sufficient solution .
kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .
do kids want to watch ?
students , however , said they doubted that parental pin codes would be effective against violent videos .
" it ’ s just like the smoking laws , " said one student .
" people tell kids under 16 they ca n't smoke , but they can still get cigarettes everywhere . "
another teenager said he was confident the child-proof function could be hacked into .
" even if 20 percent hack into it , the provision would still help 80 percent , " said jarzombek .
" young people are interested in things that are forbidden , but are more or less harmless .
but these videos are so extremely violent that even adults ca n't sleep at night when they 've seen them .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .
" we now have very , very clear options on how to deal with climate change , " said stephanie tunmore , a greenpeace climate and energy campaigner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : reducing global warming wo n't derail world economy controlling global warming is economically feasible .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .

klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .

" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 05.05.2007 eu considers running galileo gps project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may decide to take the galileo project out of a european consortium 's hands the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said . eu officials said friday that transport commissioner jacques barrot will present on may 16 a list of alternatives for the struggling project , which is meant to compete with the us global positioning satellite -lrb- gps -rrb- navigation system .
the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .
little progress made so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite program has not made the progress the eu commission hoped for almost two years after being named , a private french , german , spanish , british and italian consortium of industry giants has made little progress on the project , angering the commission .
the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .

many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .

politicians want to help parents stay one technical step ahead of their kids . at some schools in germany , it 's a daily occurrence : kids beat up fellow students just so they can record the brutality on their mobile phones .
then they use the taped violence to show off to their friends .
" a friend of mine showed me a video where they threw this guy on the ground and then they kicked him the whole time , " an unidentified student told deutsche welle .
" it was pretty bad . "
parental pin code bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cell phone cameras are being used for more than kodak moments thomas jarzombek a state christian democratic union politician has developed a plan to keep brutal violence , as well as pornography , out of the hands of underage cell phone users .
" when the device is turned on for the first time , parents have the opportunity to turn on the child protection function , which is accessible with a pin code , " said jarzombek .
" it should be possible to set the device so that only content can be played back that is definitely appropriate for young people . "
he added that this kind of child protection setting is already possible for video games and pay-per-view television programs .
nearly every teenager in germany owns a cell phone and , according to experts , around two-thirds of all young mobile phone users have used the device to receive violent videos .
hotline for technically challenged parents jarzombek said the cell phone companies bear some of the responsibility for restricting access to videos with adult content .
germany ’ s largest mobile operator t-mobile sees it differently , however .
" the material that is exchanged - from vacation pictures and concert videos to negative content that glorifies violence - has nothing to do with t-mobile and the network technology , " said t-mobile spokeswoman ramona stahl .
" it ’ s private material and could be considered more of a social phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : videos are sent to other phones using wireless technology stahl said t-mobile offers a hotline for confused parents who do n't know how to use their children 's complicated cell phones . jarzombek said he did n't think the hotline was a sufficient solution .
kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .
do kids want to watch ?
students , however , said they doubted that parental pin codes would be effective against violent videos .
" it ’ s just like the smoking laws , " said one student .
" people tell kids under 16 they ca n't smoke , but they can still get cigarettes everywhere . "
another teenager said he was confident the child-proof function could be hacked into .
" even if 20 percent hack into it , the provision would still help 80 percent , " said jarzombek .
" young people are interested in things that are forbidden , but are more or less harmless .
but these videos are so extremely violent that even adults ca n't sleep at night when they 've seen them .
i don ’ t think that most kids really want to see them .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .
meinhoff had committed suicide in 1976 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic german president köhler is under pressure after meeting with klar feedback send us an e-mail .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .
little progress made so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite program has not made the progress the eu commission hoped for almost two years after being named , a private french , german , spanish , british and italian consortium of industry giants has made little progress on the project , angering the commission .
the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "
in june , eu transport ministers are to re-examine the galileo project , which is aimed at breaking europe 's dependence on the free gps system used aboard many cars , boats and aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans discover " second earth " in universe the first habitable planet similar in size and conditions to the earth has been located in a distant solar system , once again raising the possibility of life on other planets , scientists revealed wednesday .

none of the frontrunners schalke , stuttgart or bremen have easy opponents . schalke have the toughest foe - at least as far as the standings are concerned . coach hans meyer has had fifth-place nuremberg playing consistently well all season .
their clash with schalke pits the bundesliga 's two best defensive teams against one another , so goals could be at a premium . what 's worse for schalke , nuremberg have only lost six times - compared to 15 draws and 10 wins .
after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .

the egyptian has scored 12 goals since coming from bremen during the winter break , almost single-handedly giving the team a chance to stay up and mainz fans something to talk about . the good news for stuttgart fans is that mainz are on a six-game winless streak , while stuttgart themselves have won their last five .
the hosts could also be bolstered by the long-awaited return of striker mario gomez from injury . a tour through the capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have only two days to recover from their uefa cup match on thursday on sunday , bremen travel to berlin to take on ever-enigmatic hertha .
hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .

none of the frontrunners schalke , stuttgart or bremen have easy opponents . schalke have the toughest foe - at least as far as the standings are concerned . coach hans meyer has had fifth-place nuremberg playing consistently well all season .
their clash with schalke pits the bundesliga 's two best defensive teams against one another , so goals could be at a premium . what 's worse for schalke , nuremberg have only lost six times - compared to 15 draws and 10 wins .
after blowing a lead at bochum last week and seeing their advantage over stuttgart reduced to a single point , schalke know that anything less than a victory would probably cost them the top spot and confirm their reputation as perennial runners up . but schalke are playing at home , and nuremberg may lack motivation .
having already qualified for the uefa cup by reaching the german cup final , it does n't really matter to meyer 's minions where they end up in the table . of mainz and men bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stuttgart help send another struggler down to the second division ?
stuttgart 's next foes , on the other hand , have all the motivation in the world .
second-to-last mainz are in acute danger of relegation and are sure to fight their hearts out when they visit gottlieb daimler stadium . mainz have one of the league 's hottest strikers in mohamed zidan .
the egyptian has scored 12 goals since coming from bremen during the winter break , almost single-handedly giving the team a chance to stay up and mainz fans something to talk about . the good news for stuttgart fans is that mainz are on a six-game winless streak , while stuttgart themselves have won their last five .
the hosts could also be bolstered by the long-awaited return of striker mario gomez from injury . a tour through the capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have only two days to recover from their uefa cup match on thursday on sunday , bremen travel to berlin to take on ever-enigmatic hertha .
hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .
should they lose , and schalke and stuttgart win , they would five points adrift with only two games to play . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .
little progress made so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite program has not made the progress the eu commission hoped for almost two years after being named , a private french , german , spanish , british and italian consortium of industry giants has made little progress on the project , angering the commission .
the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "
in june , eu transport ministers are to re-examine the galileo project , which is aimed at breaking europe 's dependence on the free gps system used aboard many cars , boats and aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans discover " second earth " in universe the first habitable planet similar in size and conditions to the earth has been located in a distant solar system , once again raising the possibility of life on other planets , scientists revealed wednesday .

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .

many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .

" negotiations on a new global climate change agreement must be launched at the next un ministerial conference in december , " dimas said .
" it is now time for the rest of the international community to follow our lead and commit to ambitious reduction targets . "
the 27 eu countries have vowed to cut their emissions of heat-trapping carbon gases by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
it has offered to deepen this to 30 percent if other major polluters follow suit .
menu for emissions control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipcc report said cutting greenhouse emissions would n't cost the world the ipcc report , released in bangkok on friday , laid out a menu of options for limiting emissions , adding that cleaner fuels , more efficient technology and confirmed policy options were all available for achieving this goal .
under one of the report 's scenarios , to keep warming to 2.0-2.4 c -lrb- 3.6-4.3 f -rrb- over pre-industrial times , emissions would have to peak by 2015 and reduce to 50 percent to 85 percent of 2000 levels by 2050 .
yet the cost would shave only around 0.12 percentage points off annual global economic growth .
the kyoto protocol , the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , expires at the end of 2012 .
talks on renewing the deal are under way , with the next big round scheduled to take place on the indonesian resort island of bali in december .
but progress faces two big stumbling blocks - the absence of the united states , the world 's biggest polluter , from the present treaty ; and the reluctance of china , india , brazil and other large developing countries to be drawn into promising targeted emissions cuts .
under the present kyoto format , only industrialized countries , which are most to blame for global warming , make these pledges .
" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .

the possibilities are expected to range from totally taking over galileo , a system of some 30 satellites which could be operational as late as 2013 , partially financing the project or abandoning it altogether , officials have said .
an industry representative said one option seriously being considered would be for the eu to finance the first 18 satellites .
one official said that completely taking it over would cost a little less than 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- on top of the 1.5 billion euros the european commission already allocated in the 2007-2013 budget period .

the concession contract for galileo remains unsigned as the firms squabble over who will do what and eu transport ministers have set them a may 10 deadline to work out their differences .
but a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the commission last week virtually assures that wednesday 's deadline is unlikely to be met .
" they have come up with new conditions , they want more time , more money and more public guarantees , " one official close to the project said .
" if we give them more time , it could delay our satellite orders . "

" we can prevent it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said it 's time to put together an international climate policy germany , which is current president of the eu and group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , on friday said the ipcc report showed " climate catastrophe is not inevitable .
we can prevent it . "
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali .
science has done its work , now politics must do its work , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the head of kyoto 's parent organization said the bangkok report clearly showed climate change could be addressed at a reasonable cost .
" we can tackle the issue , limit and reduce the co2 emissions without destroying the world economy , " yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , said at a press conference in berlin .
" the report gives a very encouraging signal that we have at our disposal the technologies , " de boer said .
" with these options we have a chance of preventing some of the most catastrophic scenarios , " washington low-key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wanted politicians to take faster action against climate change in contrast , the rhetoric in washington was low-key and businesslike .
the us government voiced support for the ipcc document as a report that would help policymakers " make more informed decisions " and said the united states had been an " active and constructive participant " in bangkok .
it gave no indicator as to whether washington would shift its opposition to emissions caps , which the eu champions .
environmental groups , meanwhile , seized on the ipcc report as confirmation that carbon pollution could be tackled affordably .
stephan singer , european head of climate and energy with the conservation organization wwf , said the report showed " for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune . "
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse , " he said .
" we now have very , very clear options on how to deal with climate change , " said stephanie tunmore , a greenpeace climate and energy campaigner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : reducing global warming wo n't derail world economy controlling global warming is economically feasible .

kids would just turn the data transmission function back on after their parents had shut it off with the guidance of the hotline operator .
or , even worse , " other students might force them to turn everything back on and watch the trash , " jarzombek added .

" people tell kids under 16 they ca n't smoke , but they can still get cigarettes everywhere . "
another teenager said he was confident the child-proof function could be hacked into .

second-to-last mainz are in acute danger of relegation and are sure to fight their hearts out when they visit gottlieb daimler stadium . mainz have one of the league 's hottest strikers in mohamed zidan .
the egyptian has scored 12 goals since coming from bremen during the winter break , almost single-handedly giving the team a chance to stay up and mainz fans something to talk about . the good news for stuttgart fans is that mainz are on a six-game winless streak , while stuttgart themselves have won their last five .
the hosts could also be bolstered by the long-awaited return of striker mario gomez from injury . a tour through the capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have only two days to recover from their uefa cup match on thursday on sunday , bremen travel to berlin to take on ever-enigmatic hertha .
hertha have vacillated this season between playing just like a top-five team and just playing terribly - usually within the space of a week . so perhaps it 's good omen for bremen that berlin thrashed aachen last week .
that win removed all fears of relegation , and hertha could well let down their guard amidst their usual day-dreaming about how they 're going to win the league next year . but marko pantelic - the league 's most dangerous striker in the season 's first half - has finally broken a long scoring drought , and seventh-place hertha still have an outside chance of qualifying for the uefa cup . of all the top three , bremen most need a victory .

köhler is to announce his decision on the clemency application during the course of the week .
klar , who was sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 assassination of chief prosecutor siegfried buback and the abduction and murder the same year of employers ' federation chief hanns-martin schleyer , has been in jail for the past 24 years .
there is strong opposition in germany to klar 's release , not least because he and other members of the " rote armee fraktion " - also known as the baader-meinhoff gang - have refused to reveal details of the killings .
klar called for " completing the defeat of the plans of capital and opening the door for a different future " in a letter read at a left-wing conference in january .
conservatives against pardon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pardon could endanger köhler 's political future rumors have spread that politicians in the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , would vote against a second term for köhler , should he decide to pardon klar , according to der speigel .
many in germany also expressed their anger last month when klar was granted supervised day-long outings from prison .
" it is a core concern of the conservatives that terrorists who do not show any remorse are not released early , " said markus söder , the csu 's general secretary .
earlier in the week the german news magazine stern reported that köhler was leaning toward clemency for klar , whose mandatory jail sentence will expire in 2009 .
the president 's office would not comment on the stern report .
brigitte mohnhaupt , regarded as the main organizing force behind the second raf generation after andreas baader , ulrike meinhoff and others were jailed , was released in march after serving 24 years .
a total of eight raf terrorists have been pardoned since 1988 .
lasting impression in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stormed a hijacked lufthansa plane in 1977 the events of 1977 , still known as the " german autumn , " culminated in a spectacular hijacking and baader 's suicide .
in october of that year , palestinian terrorists , acting in concert with the raf , hijacked a lufthansa passenger jet to mogadishu in somalia in an attempt to press the german government to release baader and others .
the successful storming of the aircraft by german police led baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe to commit suicide in the stammheim prison built especially to house them .
meinhoff had committed suicide in 1976 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic video : german president köhler is under pressure after meeting with klar feedback feedback : send us an e-mail .

password protected the laptop was stolen in a burglary on 18 april from a printing firm that had been given the personal information so that it could write to m & s employees about pension changes .

a los angeles judge ruled she must start her sentence on 5 june and has no prospect of an early release .
ms hilton told the judge she was very sorry and that she would " pay complete attention to everything " from now on .
the socialite said she did not know her licence had been suspended when caught driving without headlights in february .
according to papers filed in los angeles ' superior court , ms hilton was stopped by california highway patrol officers on 15 january and informed she was driving on a suspended licence .
the 26-year-old then reportedly signed a document acknowledging she was not allowed to drive .
i 'm very sorry and from now on i 'm going to pay complete attention to everything paris hilton on 27 february , she was stopped by los angeles county sheriff 's department for speeding on sunset boulevard with her car 's headlights off and charged with violating her probation .
although ms hilton maintained she was not aware her licence had been suspended , court papers said the document she signed in january was found in her car 's glove compartment .
she was also accused of failing to enrol in an alcohol education programme by a court-ordered deadline .
late entrance ms hilton was sentenced to three years ' probation , fined $ 1,150 -lrb- £ 582 -rrb- , and lost her licence at the end of january after pleading no contest to a drink driving charge in september .
despite prosecutors saying the heiress deserved a jail sentence prior to friday 's hearing , ms hilton arrived at the court at least 10 minutes late .
hilton first gained notoriety for her constant partying as a teenager one of the world 's most photographed women , her arrival attracted a swarm of paparazzi at a courthouse whose most glamorous work usually consists of dealing with parking fines .
her mother , kathy , laughed when the demand for a custodial sentence was made during the prosecution 's closing argument and asked judge michael sauer for his autograph .
" i 'm very sorry and from now on i 'm going to pay complete attention to everything , " ms hilton told the court before she was sentenced .
" i 'm sorry and i did not do it on purpose at all , " she said .
but the judge was unmoved .
the 26-year-old heiress wept when the ruling was announced , and her mother shouted at the prosecutor : " you 're pathetic . "
one of ms hilton 's lawyers said the jail sentence was unfair .
" to sentence paris hilton to 45 days in jail to me was uncalled for , inappropriate and bordered on the ludicrous .
i think she was singled out because she 's who she is , " howard weitzman said .
if ms hilton does not report to jail on 5 june she will face 90 days behind bars .
ms hilton , heiress to the hilton hotel fortune , first gained notoriety for her constant partying as a teenager .
the bbc 's david willis says the austere surrounding of the all-women 's detention centre will be a far cry from the five-star luxury the hotel heiress has become used to .

a los angeles judge ruled she must start her sentence on 5 june and has no prospect of an early release .
ms hilton told the judge she was very sorry and that she would " pay complete attention to everything " from now on .
the socialite said she did not know her licence had been suspended when caught driving without headlights in february .
according to papers filed in los angeles ' superior court , ms hilton was stopped by california highway patrol officers on 15 january and informed she was driving on a suspended licence .
the 26-year-old then reportedly signed a document acknowledging she was not allowed to drive .
i 'm very sorry and from now on i 'm going to pay complete attention to everything paris hilton on 27 february , she was stopped by los angeles county sheriff 's department for speeding on sunset boulevard with her car 's headlights off and charged with violating her probation .
although ms hilton maintained she was not aware her licence had been suspended , court papers said the document she signed in january was found in her car 's glove compartment .
she was also accused of failing to enrol in an alcohol education programme by a court-ordered deadline .

despite prosecutors saying the heiress deserved a jail sentence prior to friday 's hearing , ms hilton arrived at the court at least 10 minutes late .
hilton first gained notoriety for her constant partying as a teenager one of the world 's most photographed women , her arrival attracted a swarm of paparazzi at a courthouse whose most glamorous work usually consists of dealing with parking fines .
her mother , kathy , laughed when the demand for a custodial sentence was made during the prosecution 's closing argument and asked judge michael sauer for his autograph .
" i 'm very sorry and from now on i 'm going to pay complete attention to everything , " ms hilton told the court before she was sentenced .
" i 'm sorry and i did not do it on purpose at all , " she said .
but the judge was unmoved .
the 26-year-old heiress wept when the ruling was announced , and her mother shouted at the prosecutor : " you 're pathetic . "
one of ms hilton 's lawyers said the jail sentence was unfair .
" to sentence paris hilton to 45 days in jail to me was uncalled for , inappropriate and bordered on the ludicrous .

if ms hilton does not report to jail on 5 june she will face 90 days behind bars .
ms hilton , heiress to the hilton hotel fortune , first gained notoriety for her constant partying as a teenager .
the bbc 's david willis says the austere surrounding of the all-women 's detention centre will be a far cry from the five-star luxury the hotel heiress has become used to .

lord lloyd-webber is seeking a new star for the west end show through bbc one talent contest any dream will do .
and the winner will make his stage debut in the role at the concert for diana at wembley stadium on 1 july .
" everybody who 's on it is going to be advertising something on there - it does n't matter who you are , " he said .
" that 's what 's performers and artists do . "
lord lloyd-webber is in charge of a 20-minute slot at the concert and said any dream will do was one of princess diana 's favourite songs .
large audience bbc radio five live entertainment reporter colin paterson asked lord lloyd-webber about accusations that he would use the occasion for advertising .
" if i 'm doing 20 minutes and it was her favourite song , who else would you do it with ? " he said .
" you might as well do it with your joseph who 's about to open in london . "
previews for the west end show begin five days after the concert , which will be watched by 62,000 people at the stadium and millions more on tv around the world .
the charity concert will mark the princess of wales ' 46th birthday and the 10th anniversary of her death .
the event has been organised by princes william and harry , who said they wanted it to be " the best birthday present " for their mother .
tv extension sir elton john , rod stewart , take that , duran duran and lily allen will be among the other performers .
lord lloyd-webber also said the bbc had asked him to extend the run of any dream will do .
" i said : ' look , minor problem about extending a programme where you 're casting somebody for a west end show - there is a west end show . '
" we go into rehearsal on the monday after the we do our last programme .
i said : ' very flattering , i do n't think we can . " '
a spokesman for the corporation said : " the bbc are delighted with the success of any dream will do , but presently there are no plans to extend the run . "
' rubbish ' list lord lloyd-webber 's fortune was valued at £ 750m in the recent sunday times rich list - making him richer than sir paul mccartney .
but the theatre producer disputed the valuations , saying he had written to the compiler to ask how it was calculated .
" it 's all rubbish because what it does n't say in there is that we 've got £ 120m debt in the theatres , " he said .
" i know , i 'm jolly lucky .
i 'm worth about half what it says in there if i sold everything up - it 's still a huge amount of money .
but it 's all fabricated , it seems to me . "

certainly the bosses of the big us tv networks were taking no chances .
they sent their star anchor-persons to the cuban capital , havana , this week hoping the big may day parade would see president fidel castro return to the public stage .
" we should be able to see him from here , " said craig , a canadian computer technician as he arrived at revolution square on may day morning .
the self-described " international activist " had found a prime spot , in the shadow of the monument to cuban independence hero jose marti , overlooking the plaza .
in front of us , the vast square had been turned into a parade ground .
an orchestra was rehearsing opposite a grandstand framed with posters of cuban revolutionary heroes .
to the left , you could glimpse the first row of a line of maybe half a million people , ready to start walking when the signal was given .
just behind us was the vip area .
shrouded in mystery but would fidel castro appear ?
would this day mark his return to power after a nine-month saga which , by all accounts , had brought him close to death ?
no-one knew .
so we looked for clues .
someone had noticed that the podium was in a slightly different position than usual .
had it been re-designed so that mr castro did not have to walk down any steps ?
a rumour was also going about that the president 's white-haired head of security had been spotted .
did that mean that the man he was protecting was close ?
and then there were the american television networks .
they had sent their star reporters in and had even been authorised to use satellite broadcast equipment ... permission that is rarely given in cuba .
would the cubans have allowed that unless they were certain fidel castro was going to show up ?
soon we would know .
the other castro cubans are not famed for their punctuality , but mass rallies are an exception .
at precisely 0800 local time , the most senior members of the government filed onto the podium .
carlos lage , a former doctor , now vice president , was there .
so was ricardo alarcon , the cigar-smoking head of cuba 's national assembly .
then raul castro , fidel 's younger brother , cuban defence minister , and acting president appeared .
he waved to the crowd .
that , we assumed , meant fidel was not coming .
we all phoned our editors .
" no , it is not fidel , it is raul castro , " shouted one spanish journalist down the phone , trying to undo the confusion which can arise when two of the most powerful men in a country share the same surname .
' millions of fidels ' the march began .
the american tv executives looked a little downcast .
as did the solidarity activists . "
fidel castro , even unseen and unwell , remains an utterly dominant figure in this country " but if the hundreds of thousands of cubans who started to throng past were disappointed , they really did not show it .
they had a job to do .
" bush , fascist , " shouted the smiling class of 2007 from havana 's information technology school .
" homeland or death , " chanted a group of sportsmen .
few of them seemed to be looking closely at ranks of the cuban top brass to see who was there .
fidel 's illness , recuperation , and possible return to power , has become an obsession with cuba watchers , but cubans themselves seem almost nonchalant about the whole thing .
that might be partly because they feel that , for better or worse , nothing much is going to change in cuba , with or without fidel at the helm .
certainly cuban government officials appear to be getting bored of being asked how president castro is , and whether , and when , and in what capacity he might return to power .
" i have n't the least idea , " said a slightly cross ricardo alarcon when he was last asked whether fidel would make a public appearance .
the government 's view is that the president should be left in peace to recover as quickly as possible and that the cuban revolution is about more than one man .
" cuba has millions of fidels , " is a stock response to the question of what happens here after he is gone .
but not one of those millions is putting their hat in the ring yet , because the reality is that fidel castro , even unseen and unwell , remains an utterly dominant figure in this country .
still in charge on the eve of the mayday march he wrote a lengthy article for the morning edition of granma , the main daily newspaper .
in it he spelt out his views on the dangers of us initiatives to convert corn to ethanol , warning that the policy would turn a food crop for the poor into a fuel for the rich .
the piece was crammed full of statistics , right down to the number of flexing leg movements a sugar cane worker apparently needs to make to produce 12 tons of sugar cane .
-lrb- the number , incidentally is 36,630 -rrb- .
on the lunchtime news that day , the cuban presenter had the not unchallenging task of reading the article out in its entirety .
it was the first item and went on for 15 minutes , preceding all the other reports about mayday .
it might appear that the absent fidel castro is only in the background of government here , but it is a government which still hangs on his every word .

certainly the bosses of the big us tv networks were taking no chances .
they sent their star anchor-persons to the cuban capital , havana , this week hoping the big may day parade would see president fidel castro return to the public stage .
president fidel castro has attended the may day parade for decades " we should be able to see him from here , " said craig , a canadian computer technician as he arrived at revolution square on may day morning .
the self-described " international activist " had found a prime spot , in the shadow of the monument to cuban independence hero jose marti , overlooking the plaza .
in front of us , the vast square had been turned into a parade ground .
an orchestra was rehearsing opposite a grandstand framed with posters of cuban revolutionary heroes .
to the left , you could glimpse the first row of a line of maybe half a million people , ready to start walking when the signal was given .
just behind us was the vip area .
shrouded in mystery but would fidel castro appear ?
would this day mark his return to power after a nine-month saga which , by all accounts , had brought him close to death ?
fidel castro has been recovering from an intestinal ailment no-one knew .
so we looked for clues .
someone had noticed that the podium was in a slightly different position than usual .
had it been re-designed so that mr castro did not have to walk down any steps ?
a rumour was also going about that the president 's white-haired head of security had been spotted .
did that mean that the man he was protecting was close ?
and then there were the american television networks .
they had sent their star reporters in and had even been authorised to use satellite broadcast equipment ... permission that is rarely given in cuba .
would the cubans have allowed that unless they were certain fidel castro was going to show up ?
soon we would know .
the other castro cubans are not famed for their punctuality , but mass rallies are an exception .
raul castro has been fulfilling many of his brother 's duties at precisely 0800 local time , the most senior members of the government filed onto the podium .
carlos lage , a former doctor , now vice president , was there .
so was ricardo alarcon , the cigar-smoking head of cuba 's national assembly .
then raul castro , fidel 's younger brother , cuban defence minister , and acting president appeared .
he waved to the crowd .
that , we assumed , meant fidel was not coming .
we all phoned our editors .
" no , it is not fidel , it is raul castro , " shouted one spanish journalist down the phone , trying to undo the confusion which can arise when two of the most powerful men in a country share the same surname .
' millions of fidels ' the march began .
the american tv executives looked a little downcast .
as did the solidarity activists .
fidel castro , even unseen and unwell , remains an utterly dominant figure in this country but if the hundreds of thousands of cubans who started to throng past were disappointed , they really did not show it .
they had a job to do .
" bush , fascist , " shouted the smiling class of 2007 from havana 's information technology school .
" homeland or death , " chanted a group of sportsmen .
few of them seemed to be looking closely at ranks of the cuban top brass to see who was there .
fidel 's illness , recuperation , and possible return to power , has become an obsession with cuba watchers , but cubans themselves seem almost nonchalant about the whole thing .
that might be partly because they feel that , for better or worse , nothing much is going to change in cuba , with or without fidel at the helm .
certainly cuban government officials appear to be getting bored of being asked how president castro is , and whether , and when , and in what capacity he might return to power .
" i have n't the least idea , " said a slightly cross ricardo alarcon when he was last asked whether fidel would make a public appearance .
the government 's view is that the president should be left in peace to recover as quickly as possible and that the cuban revolution is about more than one man .
" cuba has millions of fidels , " is a stock response to the question of what happens here after he is gone .
but not one of those millions is putting their hat in the ring yet , because the reality is that fidel castro , even unseen and unwell , remains an utterly dominant figure in this country .
still in charge on the eve of the mayday march he wrote a lengthy article for the morning edition of granma , the main daily newspaper .
in it he spelt out his views on the dangers of us initiatives to convert corn to ethanol , warning that the policy would turn a food crop for the poor into a fuel for the rich .
the piece was crammed full of statistics , right down to the number of flexing leg movements a sugar cane worker apparently needs to make to produce 12 tons of sugar cane .
-lrb- the number , incidentally is 36,630 -rrb- .
on the lunchtime news that day , the cuban presenter had the not unchallenging task of reading the article out in its entirety .
it was the first item and went on for 15 minutes , preceding all the other reports about mayday .
it might appear that the absent fidel castro is only in the background of government here , but it is a government which still hangs on his every word .

turks are well aware that if it continues , the military may decide to step in .
a couple of weeks ago a new poster appeared outside my local supermarket .
it was a photograph of a smiling abdullah gul with a message underneath - " congratulations ! "
that now looks more than a little premature .
mr gul 's nomination for president sparked such a strong reaction here it is now highly unlikely the foreign minister will ever take up residence in the president 's pink palace .
but these are uncertain times in turkish politics , so i would not bet on anything .
protests and demonstrations the first fevered speculation here was over whether or not the prime minister himself would run for the presidency .
he kept a stony silence for weeks , while the turkish media chattered about almost nothing else .
recep tayyip erdogan belonged to an openly pro-islamic party recep tayyip erdogan used to belong to an openly pro-islamic party and although he broke away from those roots to found the governing ak party five years ago , the idea of a president erdogan sent many turks into a state of panic .
hundreds of thousands protested in ankara , gathering around the monumental mausoleum of ataturk , the general who made turkey a modern , secular republic .
amid the flood of turkish flags i saw pensioners up on their balconies waving their support - one man still in his pyjamas , another with a window wide open , and a crackly recording of the national anthem on a loop .
the demonstrators down below cheered and clapped as they marched past .
they told me they had come out onto the street to defend the secular republic .
women said they were there to protect their freedoms , above all the right never to wear the islamic headscarf .
it was an impressive show of force .
but it was only one side of the argument , and of turkey .
buzz of excitement in the steep streets and smoke-filled coffee houses of kasimpasa i felt a very different kind of buzz : of excitement .
key dates 2 may : ruling party requests early elections 16 may : president ahmet necdet sezer 's term ends 24 june : requested dates for early polls 4 november : scheduled date for polls send us your comments the engin family welcomed me into their cramped top floor flat , in the poor istanbul suburb where recep tayyip erdogan grew up .
inside they were glued to the television news , looking forward to seeing someone who represents them in power at last .
one of their hopes was to see turkey 's first ever first lady in the islamic headscarf , a hot issue for many families here in a country that is more conservative - by and large - than its capital .
" ataturk 's own mother covered her head , " hayri engin told me , fuming at the protests against mr erdogan .
" of course it does not mean secularism is in danger . "
kebire engin wears a headscarf , but her two daughters do not .
they are still at school , where it is forbidden .
she hopes an ak party president would mean those rules could be relaxed .
" people should be able to study in a headscarf or in a mini-skirt .
it should be their choice , " she told me .
" it is what is in your heart that matters . "
military intervention mr gul 's headscarf-wearing wife is a source of concern for some critics families like the engins helped the ak party come to power five years ago .
so rather than abandon them , prime minister erdogan decided to nominate abdullah gul to run for president .
it was a compromise gesture , made under pressure , but it was also an act of deliberate defiance , choosing another man whose wife wears the headscarf .
turkey 's secularists were furious .
and so was the military .
the night mr gul failed to get elected in the first vote in parliament , i flew home to istanbul from ankara .
as i landed at midnight , i heard that the army general staff had issued a statement claiming this presidential election was a threat to the secular regime in turkey .
the military declared itself ready to intervene - if required - to defend that .
my turkish colleague 's phone rang continually with calls from friends horrified by the implications .
" i told you there would be another coup here , " one journalist reminded me , when i phoned him .
" the generals are saying ' beware , be afraid ' .
it is an open threat to the government .
the military has had enough . "
another told me later he did not sleep at all that night .
" i think everyone my age thought the same : there is a coup coming , " dogan tilic said .
when the military took over in turkey in 1980 , he was jailed along with thousands of others .
as a student activist , he says he was tortured for over a month .
" that statement from the military means it can all happen again " , he said .
" it is hard to believe we are talking about yet another coup . "
need for compromise the military seems to have stepped back from the brink for now .
the presidential vote seems likely to be put on hold and turkey will instead first elect a new parliament .
like so much in recent weeks , the end result is still anyone 's guess .
but when it is time to nominate a candidate for president again , most turks seem to believe both sides will see the urgent need for compromise .
with that in mind , i looked for that poster of abdullah gul again this week .
but it is gone .
there is an advert for apple juice up there now instead .
