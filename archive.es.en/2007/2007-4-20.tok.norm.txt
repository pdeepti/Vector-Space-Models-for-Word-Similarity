his controversial remarks - made even before the 2005 riots in the rundown paris suburbs , in which he described young delinquents as " racaille , " or scum , coupled with more recent talk of deporting illegal immigrants and setting up a separate ministry for immigration and national identity , have convinced many on the left that he is little more than a respectable version of the far-right leader jean-marie le pen . his detractors say that the 52-year-old former protégé of outgoing president jacques chirac , is a divisive character who has no chance of uniting a country of 60 million people behind the many reforms he says are needed . sarkozy retorts that such personal attacks were made against former presidents , such as charles de gaulle and chirac 's socialist predecessor francois mitterrand , during their election campaigns , and that " this was a good sign . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right candidate jean-marie le pen is the campaign 's darkhorse proponent of " anglo-saxon " reforms he has advocated economic reforms that would transform france into the " anglo-saxon " model : a deregulated economy , curbing of trade union powers , privatization of public housing , reducing the number of civil servants and private investment in the university system . as interior minister , he set up the country 's first official islamic body .
he argues for us-style affirmative action programs to help disadvantaged youth of black and arab origin .
his call for state aid in setting up mosques for muslims was also denounced . favors us , opposed to turkey 's eu bid on the foreign policy front , he strongly opposes turkish membership in the european union , and has atlanticist leanings , though he was opposed to the war in iraq .
he wants france to improve its ties with the united states , leading the opposition socialist party to describe him as an " american neo-con with a french passport . " sarkozy , 52 , had a privileged upbringing in the affluent paris suburb of neuilly , where he later served as mayor from 1983 to 2002 . he studied law - and later worked as a lawyer - but did not attend the prestigious national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- that for generations has supplied france with many of its top politicians and business leaders . sarkozy likes to point out that , unlike his main rival , the socialist segolene royal , he is not a member of this elite . personal life as fodder for the tabloids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- was once sarkozy 's mentor twice married , he has three children - the third by his current wife , cecilia .
their stormy relationship has received widespread coverage in the gossip magazines . cecilia has been noticeably absent from sarkozy 's side during the election campaign , prompting jean-marie le pen to allude this week to rumors of fresh marital troubles . his political career began in the 1970s as a supporter of chirac , who initially saw him as a possible successor .
but they had a falling out after sarkozy backed a rival in the 1995 presidential election . with chirac 's re-election in 2002 , sarkozy was overlooked for the post of prime minister and instead took over at interior , where he began preparing his bid for the 2007 presidential election . the first round of elections will take place on sunday .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .
the pressure is on those who are chasing schalke .
they have to catch us . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke keeping an eye on german title little changed in the german top flight .
as the number of remaining matches dwindles , schalke kept up their led on the rest of the league while the fight among to avoid relegation continued at the bottom of the table .

voters initially gave a warm response to a politician who seemed willing to break taboos - calling for " boot camps " for young offenders and " citizen juries " to assess elected officials . her political background however is strictly conventional .
after attending the elite sciences po and national administration school -lrb- l 'ena -rrb- , which have groomed generations of top leaders , she was cherry-picked by former socialist president francois mitterrand and spent six years as one of his advisors . in 1988 , she was elected to the national assembly , and four years later , served for one year as environment minister . focus on social , education issues in the socialist government of 1997 to 2002 , she was junior minister for education , then later vice minister for family affairs .
she has also tended to focus her campaign on social issues , rather than on economic or foreign policy matters . in france , presidents have a strong mandate in foreign policy , and royal has been struggling to erase the perception that she is a novice in this area .
asked whether turkey should be allowed to join the european union , she merely responded " my opinion is that of the french people . "
on another crucial issue , that of iran 's nuclear ambitions , royal also appeared to fumble . political breakthrough as a " woman to watch " royal 's breakthrough came in the regional elections of 2004 when she wrested control of the poitou-charentes region from then prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
after that she was marked by the media as a " woman to watch . " one of eight children of a military officer from lorraine in northeast france , who was born in senegal .
royal 's former political rival and partner is socialist leader francois hollande , with whom she has four children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal with partner francois hollande elegant and immaculately dressed , she was voted last year as the world 's sixth sexiest woman in a french magazine after appearing on another cover in a bikini .
she is also articulate , outspoken and believes profoundly in the mission to create a new contract between politicians and the public . detractors on the left and right but detractor , s such as her former top campaign advisor eric besson , say she is an authoritarian with , " an ultra-personal conception of power . " critics on the right say that the manifesto speech of february 11 was nakedly left-wing and stripped away any pretence of a tony blair-style " third way . " but in march she was accused of playing into the hands of the far-right after calling for her supporters to reclaim the national anthem and display the flag in state schools . royal 's rallies have been wrapping up with loudspeakers blasting out " la marseillaise , " which is more often associated in french politics with jean-marie le pen 's far-right , anti-immigration national front party . dw staff / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french election campaign swerves to the right as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs .

voters initially gave a warm response to a politician who seemed willing to break taboos - calling for " boot camps " for young offenders and " citizen juries " to assess elected officials . her political background however is strictly conventional .
after attending the elite sciences po and national administration school -lrb- l 'ena -rrb- , which have groomed generations of top leaders , she was cherry-picked by former socialist president francois mitterrand and spent six years as one of his advisors . in 1988 , she was elected to the national assembly , and four years later , served for one year as environment minister . focus on social , education issues in the socialist government of 1997 to 2002 , she was junior minister for education , then later vice minister for family affairs .
she has also tended to focus her campaign on social issues , rather than on economic or foreign policy matters . in france , presidents have a strong mandate in foreign policy , and royal has been struggling to erase the perception that she is a novice in this area .
asked whether turkey should be allowed to join the european union , she merely responded " my opinion is that of the french people . "
on another crucial issue , that of iran 's nuclear ambitions , royal also appeared to fumble . political breakthrough as a " woman to watch " royal 's breakthrough came in the regional elections of 2004 when she wrested control of the poitou-charentes region from then prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
after that she was marked by the media as a " woman to watch . " one of eight children of a military officer from lorraine in northeast france , who was born in senegal .
royal 's former political rival and partner is socialist leader francois hollande , with whom she has four children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal with partner francois hollande elegant and immaculately dressed , she was voted last year as the world 's sixth sexiest woman in a french magazine after appearing on another cover in a bikini .
she is also articulate , outspoken and believes profoundly in the mission to create a new contract between politicians and the public . detractors on the left and right but detractor , s such as her former top campaign advisor eric besson , say she is an authoritarian with , " an ultra-personal conception of power . " critics on the right say that the manifesto speech of february 11 was nakedly left-wing and stripped away any pretence of a tony blair-style " third way . " but in march she was accused of playing into the hands of the far-right after calling for her supporters to reclaim the national anthem and display the flag in state schools . royal 's rallies have been wrapping up with loudspeakers blasting out " la marseillaise , " which is more often associated in french politics with jean-marie le pen 's far-right , anti-immigration national front party . dw staff / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french election campaign swerves to the right as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs .

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much . " effective engagement is surely as much about understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say , " he argues in an advance copy of the speech distributed in brussels . on saturday in cyprus , there will be a key meeting between eu health commissioner markos kyprianou and russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev to discuss the embargo on polish meat and other farm products . it is hoped those talks will make some progress ahead of a visit to luxembourg on monday by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of his eu counterparts where all the contentious issues are expected to be addressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

his movie , " auf der anderen seite , " is the only german entry competing for the golden palm . fatih akin achieved widespread acclaim with his film " head on " -lrb- " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which was the hit of the 2004 berlin film festival .
his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "
akin told reporters on thursday that he was immensely pleased that his film was nominated for the top award , for which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced .
" i 've just arrived at where i wanted to go , " he said .
" we 'll see where the journey goes from here . "
six lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin posed with the golden bear he won in berlin in 2004 his film tells the story of six people whose lives take unexpected turns .
as he did in " head on , " akin explores the often emotionally laden points where turkish and german culture intersect .
one character , a female university student , falls in love with a turkish political activist who has fled from istanbul to germany , much to the horror of her mother .
the life of a german professor of turkish descent collides with that of his traditional father when he meets his father 's female companion .
she is working as a prostitute in germany in order to pay for her daughter 's studies in istanbul .
" auf der anderen seite " is scheduled to appear this fall in german cinemas .

michael moore , who won the palm in 2004 for his biting documentary " fahrenheit 9/11 , " will be back with another out-of-competition film , " sicko , " about the us health system .
british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .
wong , the hong kong director who was jury president last year , will be given the honor of opening the festival with " my blueberry nights , " an english-language road-trip movie starring singer norah jones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer-clad starlets are n't always the only ones on the red carpet at cannes quentin tarantino - who already won the palm in 1994 for " pulp fiction " - will present " death proof , " a movie packed with the us director 's trademark banter and bloodshed and which has been released in the us as half of a two-part gore collaboration called " grindhouse . "
they will be joined by several new faces , among them an iranian , marjane satrapi , who will be bringing her popular comic books about life in tehran to the big screen .
this year 's palme d 'or jury is headed by british director stephen frears , who made the award-winning film " the queen . "
he will be accompanied by eight other personalities from the cinema and literary worlds , including actresses toni colette from australia and maggie cheung from china , and nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk from turkey .

seehofer wants to see better nutritional information presented to the public and an obesity prevention strategy formulated that calls on the participation of politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry .
he said in may he would present the key points of the strategy that would promote more balanced nutrition and encourage more physical activity .

wolfgang zöller , deputy head of the conservative union bloc in the german parliament , blamed the weight gain , especially among children , on recent decisions often associated with cost cutting .
" it makes little sense to talk about a healthy diet when at the same time , schools are cutting their physical education classes and government offices slashing jobs for nutritionists , " he told the daily .
" when you see what 's on offer at school snack bars , it might be considered criminal assault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children do far too much of this , experts say the food industry also came in for criticism .
renate künast , former agriculture minister and now the head of the green party 's parliamentary group , said new rules on advertising are needed as well as labeling guidelines that clearly indicate the content of foods and snacks .
" firms like ferrero have cashed in for years with so-called children 's foods , which are much too fatty and sweet , " she said .
the aok health insurance company , one of germany 's largest , called the study " alarming , " primarily because so many children and youth were affected .

it found that among eu countries , germany has the most overweight women and men .

" firms like ferrero have cashed in for years with so-called children 's foods , which are much too fatty and sweet , " she said .
the aok health insurance company , one of germany 's largest , called the study " alarming , " primarily because so many children and youth were affected .
" just like with anti-smoking initiatives , we have to finally realize that action is needed regarding obesity and -lrb- being -rrb- overweight , " said hans-jörg freese , a spokesman for the company . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for bulky bicyclist , fatter was better where does a 440-pound man fall off his bike ?

voters initially gave a warm response to a politician who seemed willing to break taboos - calling for " boot camps " for young offenders and " citizen juries " to assess elected officials . her political background however is strictly conventional .
after attending the elite sciences po and national administration school -lrb- l 'ena -rrb- , which have groomed generations of top leaders , she was cherry-picked by former socialist president francois mitterrand and spent six years as one of his advisors . in 1988 , she was elected to the national assembly , and four years later , served for one year as environment minister . focus on social , education issues in the socialist government of 1997 to 2002 , she was junior minister for education , then later vice minister for family affairs .
she has also tended to focus her campaign on social issues , rather than on economic or foreign policy matters . in france , presidents have a strong mandate in foreign policy , and royal has been struggling to erase the perception that she is a novice in this area .
asked whether turkey should be allowed to join the european union , she merely responded " my opinion is that of the french people . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.04.2007 french candidates wind up campaigns ahead of election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to the voters now candidates for the french presidency wound up their campaigns friday ahead of the first round of voting on sunday , in which right-winger nicolas sarkozy is expected to emerge as winner ahead of socialist segolene royal . official campaigning for round one was due to close at midnight friday , after which opinion polls are prohibited and the media banned from reporting statements from the 12 candidates . after a day meant for discussion among family and friends , voting opens across france at 8 a.m.
sunday morning and ends 12 hours later , with normally reliable projections due out immediately . the two front-runners from the ballot qualify for a decisive second round on may 6 - the system having been devised for the 49-year-old fifth republic so that all presidents are elected with more than half the vote . the leading contenders held their last rallies on thursday evening , appealing to the third of the 44.5 million voters that pollsters say are still undecided .
on friday , sarkozy , royal and bayrou limited themselves to photo-calls , with short declarations to accompanying reporters . sarkozy in the saddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy posed as a cowboy for the photographers sarkozy , the 52-year-old former interior minister and head of the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , visited a bull ranch in the southern camargue region , posing for photographers in jeans and checkered shirt . " a presidential campaign is obviously exhausting , but i do n't feel exhausted , i do n't feel at the end of my resources .
i still have things to say , " he said . royal shops for voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal tried a strawberry as the cameras were watching royal , 53 , who is a former environment minister and wants to be france 's first female president , was in paris where she shared a walkabout in a city center market with socialist mayor bertrand delanoe . earlier she urged " all those who have republican and humanist values " to vote for her in round one " because the history of france must be written with the largest number of citizens . " bayrou is confident bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou reached out on thursday bayrou , the 55-year-old leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , visited the world war i cemetery and memorial at verdun , where he said he was " confident that the french will vote for me , because everyone knows that my candidacy can beat the super-favorite in round two . " with sarkozy seemingly assured by opinion polls of a place in the decisive second round , speculation is focusing on who will come in second on sunday . royal has been consistently placed a few points ahead of bayrou , but the udf leader is the only candidate that polls suggest is sure of beating sarkozy on may 6 .
this raises the possibility that left-wing voters will switch tactically to bayrou in order to keep out sarkozy , analysts said . le pen wo n't go away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen warned that he still needs to be reckoned with another unknown is the level of support for far-right veteran jean-marie le pen , 78 , who says that his poll rating of between 12 and 16 percent underestimates his true level of support . in the 2002 election , le pen transfixed the world when he beat socialist candidate lionel jospin in round one - despite polls that had put him well behind in the run-up . cleaning up after chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's not too pleased with any of his potential successors france is choosing a successor to jacques chirac - who has been president since 1995 - in an election seen as one of the most exciting and important in recent times . all three main candidates come from a new generation of political leaders , and all claim to represent a radical break from the past .
all also describe france as a country in crisis , thanks to massive debt , high unemployment , low income levels and simmering discord in the riot-hit suburbs . in sarkozy and royal , voters face a clear choice between a right-wing program based on free-market ideas and a left winger promising to safeguard the country 's " social model . " all eight other candidates have been polling at less than 5 percent .
they include three trotskyites , a communist , a green and anti-capitalist campaigner jose bove .
the other two are a hunters ' rights candidate and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france 's next president : sarko vs. sego dw-world.de reviews the candidates and issues that drove the french presidential campaign ahead of sunday 's vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.04.2007 schalke fans brace for first-ever bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen faithful are convinced that schalke 04 will be lifting the real thing in may the wounds inflicted by the great bundesliga robbery of 2001 are still raw for many schalke 04 fans .
but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .

his movie , " auf der anderen seite , " is the only german entry competing for the golden palm . fatih akin achieved widespread acclaim with his film " head on " -lrb- " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which was the hit of the 2004 berlin film festival .
his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "
akin told reporters on thursday that he was immensely pleased that his film was nominated for the top award , for which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced .
" i 've just arrived at where i wanted to go , " he said .
" we 'll see where the journey goes from here . "
six lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin posed with the golden bear he won in berlin in 2004 his film tells the story of six people whose lives take unexpected turns .

michael moore , who won the palm in 2004 for his biting documentary " fahrenheit 9/11 , " will be back with another out-of-competition film , " sicko , " about the us health system .
british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .
wong , the hong kong director who was jury president last year , will be given the honor of opening the festival with " my blueberry nights , " an english-language road-trip movie starring singer norah jones .

"
they will be joined by several new faces , among them an iranian , marjane satrapi , who will be bringing her popular comic books about life in tehran to the big screen .
this year 's palme d 'or jury is headed by british director stephen frears , who made the award-winning film " the queen . "
he will be accompanied by eight other personalities from the cinema and literary worlds , including actresses toni colette from australia and maggie cheung from china , and nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk from turkey .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .

why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .

his controversial remarks - made even before the 2005 riots in the rundown paris suburbs , in which he described young delinquents as " racaille , " or scum , coupled with more recent talk of deporting illegal immigrants and setting up a separate ministry for immigration and national identity , have convinced many on the left that he is little more than a respectable version of the far-right leader jean-marie le pen . his detractors say that the 52-year-old former protégé of outgoing president jacques chirac , is a divisive character who has no chance of uniting a country of 60 million people behind the many reforms he says are needed . sarkozy retorts that such personal attacks were made against former presidents , such as charles de gaulle and chirac 's socialist predecessor francois mitterrand , during their election campaigns , and that " this was a good sign . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right candidate jean-marie le pen is the campaign 's darkhorse proponent of " anglo-saxon " reforms he has advocated economic reforms that would transform france into the " anglo-saxon " model : a deregulated economy , curbing of trade union powers , privatization of public housing , reducing the number of civil servants and private investment in the university system . as interior minister , he set up the country 's first official islamic body .
he argues for us-style affirmative action programs to help disadvantaged youth of black and arab origin .
his call for state aid in setting up mosques for muslims was also denounced . favors us , opposed to turkey 's eu bid on the foreign policy front , he strongly opposes turkish membership in the european union , and has atlanticist leanings , though he was opposed to the war in iraq .
he wants france to improve its ties with the united states , leading the opposition socialist party to describe him as an " american neo-con with a french passport . " sarkozy , 52 , had a privileged upbringing in the affluent paris suburb of neuilly , where he later served as mayor from 1983 to 2002 . he studied law - and later worked as a lawyer - but did not attend the prestigious national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- that for generations has supplied france with many of its top politicians and business leaders . sarkozy likes to point out that , unlike his main rival , the socialist segolene royal , he is not a member of this elite . personal life as fodder for the tabloids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- was once sarkozy 's mentor twice married , he has three children - the third by his current wife , cecilia .
their stormy relationship has received widespread coverage in the gossip magazines . cecilia has been noticeably absent from sarkozy 's side during the election campaign , prompting jean-marie le pen to allude this week to rumors of fresh marital troubles . his political career began in the 1970s as a supporter of chirac , who initially saw him as a possible successor .
but they had a falling out after sarkozy backed a rival in the 1995 presidential election . with chirac 's re-election in 2002 , sarkozy was overlooked for the post of prime minister and instead took over at interior , where he began preparing his bid for the 2007 presidential election . the first round of elections will take place on sunday .

voters initially gave a warm response to a politician who seemed willing to break taboos - calling for " boot camps " for young offenders and " citizen juries " to assess elected officials . her political background however is strictly conventional .
after attending the elite sciences po and national administration school -lrb- l 'ena -rrb- , which have groomed generations of top leaders , she was cherry-picked by former socialist president francois mitterrand and spent six years as one of his advisors . in 1988 , she was elected to the national assembly , and four years later , served for one year as environment minister . focus on social , education issues in the socialist government of 1997 to 2002 , she was junior minister for education , then later vice minister for family affairs .
she has also tended to focus her campaign on social issues , rather than on economic or foreign policy matters . in france , presidents have a strong mandate in foreign policy , and royal has been struggling to erase the perception that she is a novice in this area .
asked whether turkey should be allowed to join the european union , she merely responded " my opinion is that of the french people . "
on another crucial issue , that of iran 's nuclear ambitions , royal also appeared to fumble . political breakthrough as a " woman to watch " royal 's breakthrough came in the regional elections of 2004 when she wrested control of the poitou-charentes region from then prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
after that she was marked by the media as a " woman to watch . " one of eight children of a military officer from lorraine in northeast france , who was born in senegal .
royal 's former political rival and partner is socialist leader francois hollande , with whom she has four children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal with partner francois hollande elegant and immaculately dressed , she was voted last year as the world 's sixth sexiest woman in a french magazine after appearing on another cover in a bikini .
she is also articulate , outspoken and believes profoundly in the mission to create a new contract between politicians and the public . detractors on the left and right but detractor , s such as her former top campaign advisor eric besson , say she is an authoritarian with , " an ultra-personal conception of power . " critics on the right say that the manifesto speech of february 11 was nakedly left-wing and stripped away any pretence of a tony blair-style " third way . " but in march she was accused of playing into the hands of the far-right after calling for her supporters to reclaim the national anthem and display the flag in state schools . royal 's rallies have been wrapping up with loudspeakers blasting out " la marseillaise , " which is more often associated in french politics with jean-marie le pen 's far-right , anti-immigration national front party . dw staff / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french election campaign swerves to the right as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 20.04.2007 schalke fans brace for first-ever bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen faithful are convinced that schalke 04 will be lifting the real thing in may the wounds inflicted by the great bundesliga robbery of 2001 are still raw for many schalke 04 fans .
but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .
the pressure is on those who are chasing schalke .
they have to catch us . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke keeping an eye on german title little changed in the german top flight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.04.2007 schalke fans brace for first-ever bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen faithful are convinced that schalke 04 will be lifting the real thing in may the wounds inflicted by the great bundesliga robbery of 2001 are still raw for many schalke 04 fans .
but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .
the pressure is on those who are chasing schalke .
they have to catch us . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke keeping an eye on german title little changed in the german top flight .
as the number of remaining matches dwindles , schalke kept up their led on the rest of the league while the fight among to avoid relegation continued at the bottom of the table .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .
the pressure is on those who are chasing schalke .
they have to catch us . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke keeping an eye on german title little changed in the german top flight .
as the number of remaining matches dwindles , schalke kept up their led on the rest of the league while the fight among to avoid relegation continued at the bottom of the table .
-lrb- 16.04.2007 -rrb- schalke and bremen battle for the title a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .

his movie , " auf der anderen seite , " is the only german entry competing for the golden palm . fatih akin achieved widespread acclaim with his film " head on " -lrb- " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which was the hit of the 2004 berlin film festival .
his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "
akin told reporters on thursday that he was immensely pleased that his film was nominated for the top award , for which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced .
" i 've just arrived at where i wanted to go , " he said .
" we 'll see where the journey goes from here . "
six lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin posed with the golden bear he won in berlin in 2004 his film tells the story of six people whose lives take unexpected turns .
as he did in " head on , " akin explores the often emotionally laden points where turkish and german culture intersect .
one character , a female university student , falls in love with a turkish political activist who has fled from istanbul to germany , much to the horror of her mother .
the life of a german professor of turkish descent collides with that of his traditional father when he meets his father 's female companion .
she is working as a prostitute in germany in order to pay for her daughter 's studies in istanbul .
" auf der anderen seite " is scheduled to appear this fall in german cinemas .
before 2004 , no german film had made it into the festival 's central competition for 11 years .
in 2004 , " the edukators " made the cuts , and in 2005 , wim wender 's " do n't come knocking " was nominated .
old pros and new faces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , the film " the edukators " broke a long dry spell for germans at cannes this year , veteran directors quentin tarantino , emir kusturica , gus van sant and wong kar wai will be vying against a large group of up-and-coming young filmmakers for the golden palm .
for the 60th festival , the red-carpet glamour will be stepped up , with brad pitt , george clooney , julia roberts , catherine zeta-jones , matt damon , al pacino and andy garcia all expected for the premiere of " ocean 's thirteen , " which will be screened out of competition .
michael moore , who won the palm in 2004 for his biting documentary " fahrenheit 9/11 , " will be back with another out-of-competition film , " sicko , " about the us health system .
british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .
wong , the hong kong director who was jury president last year , will be given the honor of opening the festival with " my blueberry nights , " an english-language road-trip movie starring singer norah jones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer-clad starlets are n't always the only ones on the red carpet at cannes quentin tarantino - who already won the palm in 1994 for " pulp fiction " - will present " death proof , " a movie packed with the us director 's trademark banter and bloodshed and which has been released in the us as half of a two-part gore collaboration called " grindhouse . "
they will be joined by several new faces , among them an iranian , marjane satrapi , who will be bringing her popular comic books about life in tehran to the big screen .
this year 's palme d 'or jury is headed by british director stephen frears , who made the award-winning film " the queen . "
he will be accompanied by eight other personalities from the cinema and literary worlds , including actresses toni colette from australia and maggie cheung from china , and nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk from turkey .

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much . " effective engagement is surely as much about understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say , " he argues in an advance copy of the speech distributed in brussels . on saturday in cyprus , there will be a key meeting between eu health commissioner markos kyprianou and russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev to discuss the embargo on polish meat and other farm products . it is hoped those talks will make some progress ahead of a visit to luxembourg on monday by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of his eu counterparts where all the contentious issues are expected to be addressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

his controversial remarks - made even before the 2005 riots in the rundown paris suburbs , in which he described young delinquents as " racaille , " or scum , coupled with more recent talk of deporting illegal immigrants and setting up a separate ministry for immigration and national identity , have convinced many on the left that he is little more than a respectable version of the far-right leader jean-marie le pen . his detractors say that the 52-year-old former protégé of outgoing president jacques chirac , is a divisive character who has no chance of uniting a country of 60 million people behind the many reforms he says are needed . sarkozy retorts that such personal attacks were made against former presidents , such as charles de gaulle and chirac 's socialist predecessor francois mitterrand , during their election campaigns , and that " this was a good sign . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right candidate jean-marie le pen is the campaign 's darkhorse proponent of " anglo-saxon " reforms he has advocated economic reforms that would transform france into the " anglo-saxon " model : a deregulated economy , curbing of trade union powers , privatization of public housing , reducing the number of civil servants and private investment in the university system . as interior minister , he set up the country 's first official islamic body .
he argues for us-style affirmative action programs to help disadvantaged youth of black and arab origin .
his call for state aid in setting up mosques for muslims was also denounced . favors us , opposed to turkey 's eu bid on the foreign policy front , he strongly opposes turkish membership in the european union , and has atlanticist leanings , though he was opposed to the war in iraq .
he wants france to improve its ties with the united states , leading the opposition socialist party to describe him as an " american neo-con with a french passport . " sarkozy , 52 , had a privileged upbringing in the affluent paris suburb of neuilly , where he later served as mayor from 1983 to 2002 . he studied law - and later worked as a lawyer - but did not attend the prestigious national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- that for generations has supplied france with many of its top politicians and business leaders . sarkozy likes to point out that , unlike his main rival , the socialist segolene royal , he is not a member of this elite . personal life as fodder for the tabloids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- was once sarkozy 's mentor twice married , he has three children - the third by his current wife , cecilia .
their stormy relationship has received widespread coverage in the gossip magazines . cecilia has been noticeably absent from sarkozy 's side during the election campaign , prompting jean-marie le pen to allude this week to rumors of fresh marital troubles . his political career began in the 1970s as a supporter of chirac , who initially saw him as a possible successor .
but they had a falling out after sarkozy backed a rival in the 1995 presidential election . with chirac 's re-election in 2002 , sarkozy was overlooked for the post of prime minister and instead took over at interior , where he began preparing his bid for the 2007 presidential election . the first round of elections will take place on sunday .

after attending the elite sciences po and national administration school -lrb- l 'ena -rrb- , which have groomed generations of top leaders , she was cherry-picked by former socialist president francois mitterrand and spent six years as one of his advisors . in 1988 , she was elected to the national assembly , and four years later , served for one year as environment minister . focus on social , education issues in the socialist government of 1997 to 2002 , she was junior minister for education , then later vice minister for family affairs .
she has also tended to focus her campaign on social issues , rather than on economic or foreign policy matters . in france , presidents have a strong mandate in foreign policy , and royal has been struggling to erase the perception that she is a novice in this area .
asked whether turkey should be allowed to join the european union , she merely responded " my opinion is that of the french people . "
on another crucial issue , that of iran 's nuclear ambitions , royal also appeared to fumble . political breakthrough as a " woman to watch " royal 's breakthrough came in the regional elections of 2004 when she wrested control of the poitou-charentes region from then prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
after that she was marked by the media as a " woman to watch . " one of eight children of a military officer from lorraine in northeast france , who was born in senegal .
royal 's former political rival and partner is socialist leader francois hollande , with whom she has four children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal with partner francois hollande elegant and immaculately dressed , she was voted last year as the world 's sixth sexiest woman in a french magazine after appearing on another cover in a bikini .
she is also articulate , outspoken and believes profoundly in the mission to create a new contract between politicians and the public . detractors on the left and right but detractor , s such as her former top campaign advisor eric besson , say she is an authoritarian with , " an ultra-personal conception of power . " critics on the right say that the manifesto speech of february 11 was nakedly left-wing and stripped away any pretence of a tony blair-style " third way . " but in march she was accused of playing into the hands of the far-right after calling for her supporters to reclaim the national anthem and display the flag in state schools . royal 's rallies have been wrapping up with loudspeakers blasting out " la marseillaise , " which is more often associated in french politics with jean-marie le pen 's far-right , anti-immigration national front party . dw staff / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french election campaign swerves to the right as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs .

after attending the elite sciences po and national administration school -lrb- l 'ena -rrb- , which have groomed generations of top leaders , she was cherry-picked by former socialist president francois mitterrand and spent six years as one of his advisors . in 1988 , she was elected to the national assembly , and four years later , served for one year as environment minister . focus on social , education issues in the socialist government of 1997 to 2002 , she was junior minister for education , then later vice minister for family affairs .
she has also tended to focus her campaign on social issues , rather than on economic or foreign policy matters . in france , presidents have a strong mandate in foreign policy , and royal has been struggling to erase the perception that she is a novice in this area .
asked whether turkey should be allowed to join the european union , she merely responded " my opinion is that of the french people . "
on another crucial issue , that of iran 's nuclear ambitions , royal also appeared to fumble . political breakthrough as a " woman to watch " royal 's breakthrough came in the regional elections of 2004 when she wrested control of the poitou-charentes region from then prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
after that she was marked by the media as a " woman to watch . " one of eight children of a military officer from lorraine in northeast france , who was born in senegal .
royal 's former political rival and partner is socialist leader francois hollande , with whom she has four children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal with partner francois hollande elegant and immaculately dressed , she was voted last year as the world 's sixth sexiest woman in a french magazine after appearing on another cover in a bikini .
she is also articulate , outspoken and believes profoundly in the mission to create a new contract between politicians and the public . detractors on the left and right but detractor , s such as her former top campaign advisor eric besson , say she is an authoritarian with , " an ultra-personal conception of power . " critics on the right say that the manifesto speech of february 11 was nakedly left-wing and stripped away any pretence of a tony blair-style " third way . " but in march she was accused of playing into the hands of the far-right after calling for her supporters to reclaim the national anthem and display the flag in state schools . royal 's rallies have been wrapping up with loudspeakers blasting out " la marseillaise , " which is more often associated in french politics with jean-marie le pen 's far-right , anti-immigration national front party . dw staff / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french election campaign swerves to the right as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs .

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much . " effective engagement is surely as much about understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say , " he argues in an advance copy of the speech distributed in brussels . on saturday in cyprus , there will be a key meeting between eu health commissioner markos kyprianou and russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev to discuss the embargo on polish meat and other farm products . it is hoped those talks will make some progress ahead of a visit to luxembourg on monday by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of his eu counterparts where all the contentious issues are expected to be addressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

his controversial remarks - made even before the 2005 riots in the rundown paris suburbs , in which he described young delinquents as " racaille , " or scum , coupled with more recent talk of deporting illegal immigrants and setting up a separate ministry for immigration and national identity , have convinced many on the left that he is little more than a respectable version of the far-right leader jean-marie le pen . his detractors say that the 52-year-old former protégé of outgoing president jacques chirac , is a divisive character who has no chance of uniting a country of 60 million people behind the many reforms he says are needed . sarkozy retorts that such personal attacks were made against former presidents , such as charles de gaulle and chirac 's socialist predecessor francois mitterrand , during their election campaigns , and that " this was a good sign .

he wants france to improve its ties with the united states , leading the opposition socialist party to describe him as an " american neo-con with a french passport . " sarkozy , 52 , had a privileged upbringing in the affluent paris suburb of neuilly , where he later served as mayor from 1983 to 2002 . he studied law - and later worked as a lawyer - but did not attend the prestigious national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- that for generations has supplied france with many of its top politicians and business leaders . sarkozy likes to point out that , unlike his main rival , the socialist segolene royal , he is not a member of this elite . personal life as fodder for the tabloids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- was once sarkozy 's mentor twice married , he has three children - the third by his current wife , cecilia .
their stormy relationship has received widespread coverage in the gossip magazines . cecilia has been noticeably absent from sarkozy 's side during the election campaign , prompting jean-marie le pen to allude this week to rumors of fresh marital troubles . his political career began in the 1970s as a supporter of chirac , who initially saw him as a possible successor .
but they had a falling out after sarkozy backed a rival in the 1995 presidential election . with chirac 's re-election in 2002 , sarkozy was overlooked for the post of prime minister and instead took over at interior , where he began preparing his bid for the 2007 presidential election . the first round of elections will take place on sunday .

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much . " effective engagement is surely as much about understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say , " he argues in an advance copy of the speech distributed in brussels . on saturday in cyprus , there will be a key meeting between eu health commissioner markos kyprianou and russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev to discuss the embargo on polish meat and other farm products . it is hoped those talks will make some progress ahead of a visit to luxembourg on monday by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of his eu counterparts where all the contentious issues are expected to be addressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer he told the berliner zeitung daily that the increase in the number of people who are overweight or even obese " presents , due to its consequences on public health , a societal problem that must be addressed . "
seehofer wants to see better nutritional information presented to the public and an obesity prevention strategy formulated that calls on the participation of politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry .
he said in may he would present the key points of the strategy that would promote more balanced nutrition and encourage more physical activity .
fattest europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian women are the eu 's thinnest , the study found the new initiative was spurred on by a study released by the international association for the study of obesity .
it found that among eu countries , germany has the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight ; 75.4 percent of men are carrying excess pounds .
running a close second among women was the uk , where 58.5 percent of women are overweight .

beer , fatty foods and a lack of physical activity are the principle culprits behind germans ' weight gain , according to experts , and rates of obesity and overweight in germany now match those in the united states .
who 's to blame ?
wolfgang zöller , deputy head of the conservative union bloc in the german parliament , blamed the weight gain , especially among children , on recent decisions often associated with cost cutting .
" it makes little sense to talk about a healthy diet when at the same time , schools are cutting their physical education classes and government offices slashing jobs for nutritionists , " he told the daily .
" when you see what 's on offer at school snack bars , it might be considered criminal assault . "

renate künast , former agriculture minister and now the head of the green party 's parliamentary group , said new rules on advertising are needed as well as labeling guidelines that clearly indicate the content of foods and snacks .
" firms like ferrero have cashed in for years with so-called children 's foods , which are much too fatty and sweet , " she said .
the aok health insurance company , one of germany 's largest , called the study " alarming , " primarily because so many children and youth were affected .
" just like with anti-smoking initiatives , we have to finally realize that action is needed regarding obesity and -lrb- being -rrb- overweight , " said hans-jörg freese , a spokesman for the company . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for bulky bicyclist , fatter was better where does a 440-pound man fall off his bike ?

" unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor .

his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "

british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .
wong , the hong kong director who was jury president last year , will be given the honor of opening the festival with " my blueberry nights , " an english-language road-trip movie starring singer norah jones .

his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "
akin told reporters on thursday that he was immensely pleased that his film was nominated for the top award , for which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced .
" i 've just arrived at where i wanted to go , " he said .
" we 'll see where the journey goes from here . "
six lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin posed with the golden bear he won in berlin in 2004 his film tells the story of six people whose lives take unexpected turns .
as he did in " head on , " akin explores the often emotionally laden points where turkish and german culture intersect .
one character , a female university student , falls in love with a turkish political activist who has fled from istanbul to germany , much to the horror of her mother .
the life of a german professor of turkish descent collides with that of his traditional father when he meets his father 's female companion .
she is working as a prostitute in germany in order to pay for her daughter 's studies in istanbul .
" auf der anderen seite " is scheduled to appear this fall in german cinemas .

michael moore , who won the palm in 2004 for his biting documentary " fahrenheit 9/11 , " will be back with another out-of-competition film , " sicko , " about the us health system .
british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .
wong , the hong kong director who was jury president last year , will be given the honor of opening the festival with " my blueberry nights , " an english-language road-trip movie starring singer norah jones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer-clad starlets are n't always the only ones on the red carpet at cannes quentin tarantino - who already won the palm in 1994 for " pulp fiction " - will present " death proof , " a movie packed with the us director 's trademark banter and bloodshed and which has been released in the us as half of a two-part gore collaboration called " grindhouse . "
they will be joined by several new faces , among them an iranian , marjane satrapi , who will be bringing her popular comic books about life in tehran to the big screen .
this year 's palme d 'or jury is headed by british director stephen frears , who made the award-winning film " the queen . "
he will be accompanied by eight other personalities from the cinema and literary worlds , including actresses toni colette from australia and maggie cheung from china , and nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk from turkey .

his movie , " auf der anderen seite , " is the only german entry competing for the golden palm . fatih akin achieved widespread acclaim with his film " head on " -lrb- " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which was the hit of the 2004 berlin film festival .
his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "
akin told reporters on thursday that he was immensely pleased that his film was nominated for the top award , for which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced .
" i 've just arrived at where i wanted to go , " he said .
" we 'll see where the journey goes from here . "

for the 60th festival , the red-carpet glamour will be stepped up , with brad pitt , george clooney , julia roberts , catherine zeta-jones , matt damon , al pacino and andy garcia all expected for the premiere of " ocean 's thirteen , " which will be screened out of competition .
michael moore , who won the palm in 2004 for his biting documentary " fahrenheit 9/11 , " will be back with another out-of-competition film , " sicko , " about the us health system .
british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much .

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much . " effective engagement is surely as much about understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say , " he argues in an advance copy of the speech distributed in brussels . on saturday in cyprus , there will be a key meeting between eu health commissioner markos kyprianou and russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev to discuss the embargo on polish meat and other farm products . it is hoped those talks will make some progress ahead of a visit to luxembourg on monday by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of his eu counterparts where all the contentious issues are expected to be addressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

his controversial remarks - made even before the 2005 riots in the rundown paris suburbs , in which he described young delinquents as " racaille , " or scum , coupled with more recent talk of deporting illegal immigrants and setting up a separate ministry for immigration and national identity , have convinced many on the left that he is little more than a respectable version of the far-right leader jean-marie le pen . his detractors say that the 52-year-old former protégé of outgoing president jacques chirac , is a divisive character who has no chance of uniting a country of 60 million people behind the many reforms he says are needed . sarkozy retorts that such personal attacks were made against former presidents , such as charles de gaulle and chirac 's socialist predecessor francois mitterrand , during their election campaigns , and that " this was a good sign . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right candidate jean-marie le pen is the campaign 's darkhorse proponent of " anglo-saxon " reforms he has advocated economic reforms that would transform france into the " anglo-saxon " model : a deregulated economy , curbing of trade union powers , privatization of public housing , reducing the number of civil servants and private investment in the university system . as interior minister , he set up the country 's first official islamic body .
he argues for us-style affirmative action programs to help disadvantaged youth of black and arab origin .
his call for state aid in setting up mosques for muslims was also denounced . favors us , opposed to turkey 's eu bid on the foreign policy front , he strongly opposes turkish membership in the european union , and has atlanticist leanings , though he was opposed to the war in iraq .
he wants france to improve its ties with the united states , leading the opposition socialist party to describe him as an " american neo-con with a french passport . " sarkozy , 52 , had a privileged upbringing in the affluent paris suburb of neuilly , where he later served as mayor from 1983 to 2002 . he studied law - and later worked as a lawyer - but did not attend the prestigious national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- that for generations has supplied france with many of its top politicians and business leaders . sarkozy likes to point out that , unlike his main rival , the socialist segolene royal , he is not a member of this elite . personal life as fodder for the tabloids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- was once sarkozy 's mentor twice married , he has three children - the third by his current wife , cecilia .
their stormy relationship has received widespread coverage in the gossip magazines . cecilia has been noticeably absent from sarkozy 's side during the election campaign , prompting jean-marie le pen to allude this week to rumors of fresh marital troubles . his political career began in the 1970s as a supporter of chirac , who initially saw him as a possible successor .
but they had a falling out after sarkozy backed a rival in the 1995 presidential election . with chirac 's re-election in 2002 , sarkozy was overlooked for the post of prime minister and instead took over at interior , where he began preparing his bid for the 2007 presidential election . the first round of elections will take place on sunday .

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much . " effective engagement is surely as much about understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say , " he argues in an advance copy of the speech distributed in brussels . on saturday in cyprus , there will be a key meeting between eu health commissioner markos kyprianou and russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev to discuss the embargo on polish meat and other farm products . it is hoped those talks will make some progress ahead of a visit to luxembourg on monday by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of his eu counterparts where all the contentious issues are expected to be addressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much . " effective engagement is surely as much about understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say , " he argues in an advance copy of the speech distributed in brussels . on saturday in cyprus , there will be a key meeting between eu health commissioner markos kyprianou and russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev to discuss the embargo on polish meat and other farm products . it is hoped those talks will make some progress ahead of a visit to luxembourg on monday by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of his eu counterparts where all the contentious issues are expected to be addressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

his movie , " auf der anderen seite , " is the only german entry competing for the golden palm . fatih akin achieved widespread acclaim with his film " head on " -lrb- " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which was the hit of the 2004 berlin film festival .
his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "
akin told reporters on thursday that he was immensely pleased that his film was nominated for the top award , for which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced .
" i 've just arrived at where i wanted to go , " he said .
" we 'll see where the journey goes from here . "
six lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin posed with the golden bear he won in berlin in 2004 his film tells the story of six people whose lives take unexpected turns .
as he did in " head on , " akin explores the often emotionally laden points where turkish and german culture intersect .
one character , a female university student , falls in love with a turkish political activist who has fled from istanbul to germany , much to the horror of her mother .
the life of a german professor of turkish descent collides with that of his traditional father when he meets his father 's female companion .

michael moore , who won the palm in 2004 for his biting documentary " fahrenheit 9/11 , " will be back with another out-of-competition film , " sicko , " about the us health system .
british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .
wong , the hong kong director who was jury president last year , will be given the honor of opening the festival with " my blueberry nights , " an english-language road-trip movie starring singer norah jones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer-clad starlets are n't always the only ones on the red carpet at cannes quentin tarantino - who already won the palm in 1994 for " pulp fiction " - will present " death proof , " a movie packed with the us director 's trademark banter and bloodshed and which has been released in the us as half of a two-part gore collaboration called " grindhouse . "
they will be joined by several new faces , among them an iranian , marjane satrapi , who will be bringing her popular comic books about life in tehran to the big screen .
this year 's palme d 'or jury is headed by british director stephen frears , who made the award-winning film " the queen . "
he will be accompanied by eight other personalities from the cinema and literary worlds , including actresses toni colette from australia and maggie cheung from china , and nobel prize-winning author orhan pamuk from turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 20.04.2007 schalke fans brace for first-ever bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen faithful are convinced that schalke 04 will be lifting the real thing in may the wounds inflicted by the great bundesliga robbery of 2001 are still raw for many schalke 04 fans .
but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .
the pressure is on those who are chasing schalke .
they have to catch us . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke keeping an eye on german title little changed in the german top flight .
as the number of remaining matches dwindles , schalke kept up their led on the rest of the league while the fight among to avoid relegation continued at the bottom of the table .
-lrb- 16.04.2007 -rrb- schalke and bremen battle for the title a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .

his controversial remarks - made even before the 2005 riots in the rundown paris suburbs , in which he described young delinquents as " racaille , " or scum , coupled with more recent talk of deporting illegal immigrants and setting up a separate ministry for immigration and national identity , have convinced many on the left that he is little more than a respectable version of the far-right leader jean-marie le pen . his detractors say that the 52-year-old former protégé of outgoing president jacques chirac , is a divisive character who has no chance of uniting a country of 60 million people behind the many reforms he says are needed . sarkozy retorts that such personal attacks were made against former presidents , such as charles de gaulle and chirac 's socialist predecessor francois mitterrand , during their election campaigns , and that " this was a good sign . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right candidate jean-marie le pen is the campaign 's darkhorse proponent of " anglo-saxon " reforms he has advocated economic reforms that would transform france into the " anglo-saxon " model : a deregulated economy , curbing of trade union powers , privatization of public housing , reducing the number of civil servants and private investment in the university system . as interior minister , he set up the country 's first official islamic body .
he argues for us-style affirmative action programs to help disadvantaged youth of black and arab origin .
his call for state aid in setting up mosques for muslims was also denounced . favors us , opposed to turkey 's eu bid on the foreign policy front , he strongly opposes turkish membership in the european union , and has atlanticist leanings , though he was opposed to the war in iraq .
he wants france to improve its ties with the united states , leading the opposition socialist party to describe him as an " american neo-con with a french passport . " sarkozy , 52 , had a privileged upbringing in the affluent paris suburb of neuilly , where he later served as mayor from 1983 to 2002 . he studied law - and later worked as a lawyer - but did not attend the prestigious national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- that for generations has supplied france with many of its top politicians and business leaders . sarkozy likes to point out that , unlike his main rival , the socialist segolene royal , he is not a member of this elite . personal life as fodder for the tabloids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- was once sarkozy 's mentor twice married , he has three children - the third by his current wife , cecilia .
their stormy relationship has received widespread coverage in the gossip magazines . cecilia has been noticeably absent from sarkozy 's side during the election campaign , prompting jean-marie le pen to allude this week to rumors of fresh marital troubles . his political career began in the 1970s as a supporter of chirac , who initially saw him as a possible successor .
but they had a falling out after sarkozy backed a rival in the 1995 presidential election . with chirac 's re-election in 2002 , sarkozy was overlooked for the post of prime minister and instead took over at interior , where he began preparing his bid for the 2007 presidential election . the first round of elections will take place on sunday .

voters initially gave a warm response to a politician who seemed willing to break taboos - calling for " boot camps " for young offenders and " citizen juries " to assess elected officials . her political background however is strictly conventional .
after attending the elite sciences po and national administration school -lrb- l 'ena -rrb- , which have groomed generations of top leaders , she was cherry-picked by former socialist president francois mitterrand and spent six years as one of his advisors . in 1988 , she was elected to the national assembly , and four years later , served for one year as environment minister . focus on social , education issues in the socialist government of 1997 to 2002 , she was junior minister for education , then later vice minister for family affairs .
she has also tended to focus her campaign on social issues , rather than on economic or foreign policy matters . in france , presidents have a strong mandate in foreign policy , and royal has been struggling to erase the perception that she is a novice in this area .
asked whether turkey should be allowed to join the european union , she merely responded " my opinion is that of the french people . "
on another crucial issue , that of iran 's nuclear ambitions , royal also appeared to fumble . political breakthrough as a " woman to watch " royal 's breakthrough came in the regional elections of 2004 when she wrested control of the poitou-charentes region from then prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
after that she was marked by the media as a " woman to watch . " one of eight children of a military officer from lorraine in northeast france , who was born in senegal .
royal 's former political rival and partner is socialist leader francois hollande , with whom she has four children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal with partner francois hollande elegant and immaculately dressed , she was voted last year as the world 's sixth sexiest woman in a french magazine after appearing on another cover in a bikini .
she is also articulate , outspoken and believes profoundly in the mission to create a new contract between politicians and the public . detractors on the left and right but detractor , s such as her former top campaign advisor eric besson , say she is an authoritarian with , " an ultra-personal conception of power . " critics on the right say that the manifesto speech of february 11 was nakedly left-wing and stripped away any pretence of a tony blair-style " third way .

voters initially gave a warm response to a politician who seemed willing to break taboos - calling for " boot camps " for young offenders and " citizen juries " to assess elected officials . her political background however is strictly conventional .
after attending the elite sciences po and national administration school -lrb- l 'ena -rrb- , which have groomed generations of top leaders , she was cherry-picked by former socialist president francois mitterrand and spent six years as one of his advisors . in 1988 , she was elected to the national assembly , and four years later , served for one year as environment minister . focus on social , education issues in the socialist government of 1997 to 2002 , she was junior minister for education , then later vice minister for family affairs .
she has also tended to focus her campaign on social issues , rather than on economic or foreign policy matters . in france , presidents have a strong mandate in foreign policy , and royal has been struggling to erase the perception that she is a novice in this area .
asked whether turkey should be allowed to join the european union , she merely responded " my opinion is that of the french people . "
on another crucial issue , that of iran 's nuclear ambitions , royal also appeared to fumble . political breakthrough as a " woman to watch " royal 's breakthrough came in the regional elections of 2004 when she wrested control of the poitou-charentes region from then prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
after that she was marked by the media as a " woman to watch . " one of eight children of a military officer from lorraine in northeast france , who was born in senegal .
royal 's former political rival and partner is socialist leader francois hollande , with whom she has four children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal with partner francois hollande elegant and immaculately dressed , she was voted last year as the world 's sixth sexiest woman in a french magazine after appearing on another cover in a bikini .
she is also articulate , outspoken and believes profoundly in the mission to create a new contract between politicians and the public . detractors on the left and right but detractor , s such as her former top campaign advisor eric besson , say she is an authoritarian with , " an ultra-personal conception of power . " critics on the right say that the manifesto speech of february 11 was nakedly left-wing and stripped away any pretence of a tony blair-style " third way .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .

" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.04.2007 schalke fans brace for first-ever bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen faithful are convinced that schalke 04 will be lifting the real thing in may the wounds inflicted by the great bundesliga robbery of 2001 are still raw for many schalke 04 fans .
but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .
the pressure is on those who are chasing schalke .
they have to catch us . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke keeping an eye on german title little changed in the german top flight .
as the number of remaining matches dwindles , schalke kept up their led on the rest of the league while the fight among to avoid relegation continued at the bottom of the table .
-lrb- 16.04.2007 -rrb- schalke and bremen battle for the title a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.04.2007 schalke fans brace for first-ever bundesliga title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen faithful are convinced that schalke 04 will be lifting the real thing in may the wounds inflicted by the great bundesliga robbery of 2001 are still raw for many schalke 04 fans .
but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .
the pressure is on those who are chasing schalke .
they have to catch us . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke keeping an eye on german title little changed in the german top flight .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .
the pain of 2001 endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four minutes later , the tears of joy turned to tears of sorrow the 2001 bundesliga finale is still the closest the club has come to ending its 49-year title drought even though schalke again finished runners-up to bayern in 2005 , albeit by a more significant margin of 14 points .
the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .
" it 's like formula one , " said ulli nöther , a supporter buying a schalke overall for babies in the club 's fan shop .
" the teams beneath us have all had their pit stops , their dips in form .
we may have lost some games which we should have won but we have n't really faltered yet .
my fear is that it may come soon .
my hope is that schalke can finish the race without the wheels coming off . "
" even if our rivals win , we wo n't lose " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans believe the pressure is on the chasing pack wolf ströhmann , a proud north stand " ultra , " saw things differently .
" since we have been in either first or second place , we have only really had a consecutive run of two bad games , " he said , sipping a frothy glass of the locally produced gruben gold beer in der schalker , the bar that overlooks the club 's training ground .
" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .
since then , except when we lost to bayern and drew at hanover , the rest have been victories .
we 're strong this year and know we can win .
it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .
since hitting the top spot in week 13 of the season , schalke have only been out of the driving seat for a total of five weeks when they slipped to second at the beginning of december .
mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?

" neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said . missile shield stressing relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is concerned about us missile shield plans for eastern europe europe and russia find themselves at odds , among other things , over us plans for parts of a missile defense system to be based in poland and the czech republic and on the future status of the serbian province of kosovo . " unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape left behind by the last century , we risk getting the eu-russia relationship badly wrong , " said mandelson . in his view , russia tends to see the eu 's relations with former soviet-bloc states " not as the concern of a friendly partner , but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbor . " on monday , the diplomatic wrangling took a new turn when the german presidency of the european union voiced concern over a russian crackdown on opposition demonstrations over the weekend and urged moscow to respect democratic freedoms . energy , trade disputes continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to make sure its energy supplies remain stable last week the eu 's energy commissioner again advocated diversifying the bloc 's supplies of natural gas to reduce dependence on russian giant gazprom . on top of that , a lingering russian embargo on polish foodstuffs has delayed the start of a new wide-ranging partnership agreement . mandelson warned that trade issues between the eu and russia should not become heavily politicized . " both believe the other is using the energy weapon as an instrument of politics , " he said .
" neither thinks they enjoy the respect from the other they are entitled to expect . " little progress expected at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said eu-russia relations are hitting a low point ahead of an eu-russia summit next month , he believes that the discussions on democratic values may not accomplish much . " effective engagement is surely as much about understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say , " he argues in an advance copy of the speech distributed in brussels . on saturday in cyprus , there will be a key meeting between eu health commissioner markos kyprianou and russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev to discuss the embargo on polish meat and other farm products . it is hoped those talks will make some progress ahead of a visit to luxembourg on monday by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of his eu counterparts where all the contentious issues are expected to be addressed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .
there 's olaf thon holding the 1997 uefa cup aloft and the back-to-back dfb cup wins of 2001 and 2002 but there is one very obvious omission from the contemporary snapshots of success : there is no bundesliga championship win being celebrated .

sunday morning and ends 12 hours later , with normally reliable projections due out immediately . the two front-runners from the ballot qualify for a decisive second round on may 6 - the system having been devised for the 49-year-old fifth republic so that all presidents are elected with more than half the vote . the leading contenders held their last rallies on thursday evening , appealing to the third of the 44.5 million voters that pollsters say are still undecided .
on friday , sarkozy , royal and bayrou limited themselves to photo-calls , with short declarations to accompanying reporters . sarkozy in the saddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy posed as a cowboy for the photographers sarkozy , the 52-year-old former interior minister and head of the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , visited a bull ranch in the southern camargue region , posing for photographers in jeans and checkered shirt . " a presidential campaign is obviously exhausting , but i do n't feel exhausted , i do n't feel at the end of my resources .
i still have things to say , " he said . royal shops for voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal tried a strawberry as the cameras were watching royal , 53 , who is a former environment minister and wants to be france 's first female president , was in paris where she shared a walkabout in a city center market with socialist mayor bertrand delanoe . earlier she urged " all those who have republican and humanist values " to vote for her in round one " because the history of france must be written with the largest number of citizens . " bayrou is confident bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou reached out on thursday bayrou , the 55-year-old leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , visited the world war i cemetery and memorial at verdun , where he said he was " confident that the french will vote for me , because everyone knows that my candidacy can beat the super-favorite in round two . " with sarkozy seemingly assured by opinion polls of a place in the decisive second round , speculation is focusing on who will come in second on sunday . royal has been consistently placed a few points ahead of bayrou , but the udf leader is the only candidate that polls suggest is sure of beating sarkozy on may 6 .
this raises the possibility that left-wing voters will switch tactically to bayrou in order to keep out sarkozy , analysts said . le pen wo n't go away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen warned that he still needs to be reckoned with another unknown is the level of support for far-right veteran jean-marie le pen , 78 , who says that his poll rating of between 12 and 16 percent underestimates his true level of support . in the 2002 election , le pen transfixed the world when he beat socialist candidate lionel jospin in round one - despite polls that had put him well behind in the run-up . cleaning up after chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's not too pleased with any of his potential successors france is choosing a successor to jacques chirac - who has been president since 1995 - in an election seen as one of the most exciting and important in recent times . all three main candidates come from a new generation of political leaders , and all claim to represent a radical break from the past .
all also describe france as a country in crisis , thanks to massive debt , high unemployment , low income levels and simmering discord in the riot-hit suburbs . in sarkozy and royal , voters face a clear choice between a right-wing program based on free-market ideas and a left winger promising to safeguard the country 's " social model . " all eight other candidates have been polling at less than 5 percent .
they include three trotskyites , a communist , a green and anti-capitalist campaigner jose bove .

his movie , " auf der anderen seite , " is the only german entry competing for the golden palm . fatih akin achieved widespread acclaim with his film " head on " -lrb- " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which was the hit of the 2004 berlin film festival .
his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "
akin told reporters on thursday that he was immensely pleased that his film was nominated for the top award , for which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced .

for the 60th festival , the red-carpet glamour will be stepped up , with brad pitt , george clooney , julia roberts , catherine zeta-jones , matt damon , al pacino and andy garcia all expected for the premiere of " ocean 's thirteen , " which will be screened out of competition .
michael moore , who won the palm in 2004 for his biting documentary " fahrenheit 9/11 , " will be back with another out-of-competition film , " sicko , " about the us health system .
british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .
wong , the hong kong director who was jury president last year , will be given the honor of opening the festival with " my blueberry nights , " an english-language road-trip movie starring singer norah jones .

his movie , " auf der anderen seite , " is the only german entry competing for the golden palm . fatih akin achieved widespread acclaim with his film " head on " -lrb- " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which was the hit of the 2004 berlin film festival .
his latest film , which literally translated means " on the other side , " is one of 22 entries in the film festival 's central competition .
organizers unveiled the selection for this year 's cannes festival on thursday , saying they had programmed films that combined " heritage and modernity ... great names and young hopefuls . "
akin told reporters on thursday that he was immensely pleased that his film was nominated for the top award , for which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced .
" i 've just arrived at where i wanted to go , " he said .
" we 'll see where the journey goes from here . "
six lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin posed with the golden bear he won in berlin in 2004 his film tells the story of six people whose lives take unexpected turns .
as he did in " head on , " akin explores the often emotionally laden points where turkish and german culture intersect .
one character , a female university student , falls in love with a turkish political activist who has fled from istanbul to germany , much to the horror of her mother .
the life of a german professor of turkish descent collides with that of his traditional father when he meets his father 's female companion .

for the 60th festival , the red-carpet glamour will be stepped up , with brad pitt , george clooney , julia roberts , catherine zeta-jones , matt damon , al pacino and andy garcia all expected for the premiere of " ocean 's thirteen , " which will be screened out of competition .
michael moore , who won the palm in 2004 for his biting documentary " fahrenheit 9/11 , " will be back with another out-of-competition film , " sicko , " about the us health system .
british director michael winterbottom will be screening his film about the murder of us journalist daniel pearl .
wong , the hong kong director who was jury president last year , will be given the honor of opening the festival with " my blueberry nights , " an english-language road-trip movie starring singer norah jones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer-clad starlets are n't always the only ones on the red carpet at cannes quentin tarantino - who already won the palm in 1994 for " pulp fiction " - will present " death proof , " a movie packed with the us director 's trademark banter and bloodshed and which has been released in the us as half of a two-part gore collaboration called " grindhouse . "
they will be joined by several new faces , among them an iranian , marjane satrapi , who will be bringing her popular comic books about life in tehran to the big screen .
this year 's palme d 'or jury is headed by british director stephen frears , who made the award-winning film " the queen . "

but despite the ominously tight battle for the title this year , the majority believe their team can stay the course . " it is like an eternal bruise over my heart , " ingo meier said , his heavy-lidded eyes fixed on the remnants of his third beer of the day .
" it is a blue reminder of the pain of that day , a schalke blue spot that never stops aching . "
ingo was one of the many thousands of schalke 04 fans who celebrated wildly on may 19 , 2001 as the whistle blew on their final game of that bundesliga season ; believing amid the chaos that the 5-3 victory over unterhaching had been enough to secure the royal blues their first title since 1958 in the very last game at the club 's parkstadion home .
however , after four minutes of delirium , news broke from hamburg that bayern munich 's patrik andersson had equalized in the last minute of added time to give the bavarians the one point they needed to snatch the championship from schalke 's grasp .
in the auf schalke bar on gelsenkirchen 's kurt-schumacher-strasse , the walls are adorned with ageing photos of triumph .
fading black and white images of cup wins from a bygone age give the local a faintly melancholic atmosphere while the few colour photos of recent players celebrating attempt to inject some optimism into the surroundings .

the fact that a single point kept the team from glory six years ago still smarts with the fans and gives the 2006/2007 title run-in an ominous sense of impending symmetry .
schalke lead the bundesliga by two points with five games to go while the three clubs behind them continue to keep pace in positions from which any could capitalize should the leaders get a case of the wobbles again .
while the die-hard fans have only one choice but to believe in the imminent end of the championship curse , realists among the royal blue army are having increasingly sleepless nights .

" we lost to leverkusen and then hamburg at the end of february .

it is bad for our rivals to rely on us losing .
even if they continue to win , they will not be champions because we will not lose . "
while the failure of 2001 continues to stalk schalke 04 , many fans believe that the 2007 team is better equipped to see the championship challenge through to a successful end .

mental strength and staying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans hope any run of bad form is behind schalke it took them two weeks after the winter break to find their feet again and have now led the bundesliga for a further ten weeks .
this record suggests that the current team has the mental strength to fight back and deal with the pressure at the top .
" the lead over werder is still only two points , " said ingo meier , " but it 's their job to chase us .
in the past we would be looking over our shoulder but this season , smolka has the team looking ahead to a possible bundesliga title .
he has them fearing no-one and we have shown that we can beat anyone .
why should we be worried about what happens behind us ? "
mirko slomka was appointed as coach in january 2006 and with barely half a season to impose himself on the team he hauled schalke to a fourth place finish and narrowly missed out on a uefa cup final place .
this season schalke are his team , playing to his game plan and the fruits of this period of continuity can be seen in the way the players have reacted .
slomka keeps schalke out of mind games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the players ' coach : slomka keeps schalke focused wolf ströhmann believes that slomka has made the difference this season , getting the best out of players who had suffered motivational problems and extended dips in form .
" coach slomka is not the kind of guy to shout around and get into squabbles with people like -lrb- bayern 's -rrb- hoeness and rummenigge , " he said .
" he concentrates on the team , the players and the results .
in the past , our coaches have been distracted by the mind games .
in 2001 , schalke lost games they should have won because everyone was affected by bayern people talking about pressure .
" where 's the pressure now ?
the pressure to win ?
there 's always that pressure if you are first or last .
the pressure is on those who are chasing schalke .
they have to catch us . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke keeping an eye on german title little changed in the german top flight .

richard keen , from barmouth , gwynedd , checked on ebay for a similar trailer after his was stolen , but recognised his own and bid £ 1,500 for it .
his successful bid meant the seller 's details were revealed .
stefan rowe , 37 , from sandycroft , deeside , admitted handling stolen goods and was given 80 hours community service at dolgellau magistrates court .
prosecutor tom morgan jones told magistrates that once the seller 's details had been revealed the " warning bells must have started ringing " .
he added : " mr keen was told that there had been a misunderstanding and the trailer was withdrawn from the auction . "
' shady ' mr keen asked his brother from devon to make a bid and gave his mobile telephone number .
mr jones said the builder then went to sandycroft , deeside , where he viewed his stolen trailer and recognised some changes that he had previously made to it .
it had been bought for £ 800 by rowe and put up for sale on ebay for £ 1,500 .
mr keen informed the police and rowe later admitted handling stolen goods .
the court heard rowe believed the trailer was " shady " but because he was out of work he felt he could make money selling it online .
the prosecutor added that another man from deeside was due to appear in court charged with the theft of the trailer from mr keen 's home just before christmas 2006 .
rowe was ordered by magistrates to carry out 80 hours unpaid work in the community with £ 150 costs .
after the hearing mr keen said : " i am glad to have my trailer back and did my bit to help the police . "

the marine conservation society -lrb- mcs -rrb- said that 2,524 items of rubbish were found per kilometre on welsh beaches in the beachwatch litter survey in 2006 .
this is higher than the average for the uk and is a 44 % increase on the country 's total for 2005 .
volunteers in wales found the main source of the problem was litter left by beach visitors .
fishing debris was the second most common source of litter , while sewage-related debris was the third biggest issue .
the figures are based on data collected by volunteers during the annual clean-up operation run by the mcs in september 2006 .
litter - items per km uk average - 1,988.7 wales - 2,524.8 scotland - 2,091.7 england - 1,979.8 channel islands - 1,646.2 northern ireland - 624.6 gill bell , from mcs said wales ' beaches were suffering from " a rising tide of litter " .
she said : " wales suffers from all sources of litter but is also a victim of geography and currents with litter not only coming from land-based sources but also being brought ashore by prevailing winds and currents .
" regardless of the source , litter is on the increase and it is up to everyone to take responsibility - everyone must dispose of waste carefully and recycle where possible . "
earlier this month , the national trust blamed inconsiderate visitors for an " alarming " increase in rubbish at three cliffs bay on gower and said the problem needed to be addressed .

but instead of basking in the glory of his hard work , his head was completely filled by two words - " incurable " and " progressive " .
that morning , at the age of just 44 , barry had been told he had parkinson 's disease .
people with the condition have a shortage of the brain chemical dopamine , which controls connections between nerve cells , leading to symptoms such as tremors .
bleak but despite his suspicions over the three months of tests the final diagnosis was a cruel blow .
" i have no recollection of the journey into london .
but at noon i was crossing the bridge at battersea with the knowledge that i had an incurable disease , not knowing how it was going to affect me or what the future was . "
the doctors could not tell me anything about my future and i was just left to speculate barry sidaway an inquisitive and determined man , barry researched everything he could about the disease , but found nothing positive .
" i went to some of the meetings for people with parkinson 's and saw people in wheelchairs and after that i could not go .
the future did not look rosy .
" the doctors could not tell me anything about my future and i was just left to speculate .
" i could not get any positive information , but i am a stubborn man and i tried to find out everything i could . "
barry determined to take each day step-by-step .
he eliminated the things that aggravated his condition - such as eating protein during the day .
changes he had to give up his beloved rally driving and four years after diagnosis he stopped playing cricket , but not before scoring a century .
he went on to become managing director of his storage equipment company and now , 16 years later , is retired and living in colchester .
barry has now written a book about his experiences entitled ' the end of the beginning , ' which not only chronicles his own battles but is designed to give hope to the between 8,000 and 10,000 new cases of parkinson 's diagnosed annually in the uk .
he hopes that by telling his story people will see that the diagnosis is not a death sentence .
" i want to tell people to take the word ca n't out of their dictionary .
an illustration of the brain depicting parkinson 's " do not fight it - you will be hitting a brick wall .
" instead , continue to decide what you plan to do and accommodate the disease .
" keep up enthusiasm for life , be realistic and aim to overcome obstacles , stay in control , be patient , celebrate each victory and do not panic .
" find a regime that suits a lifestyle , not a lifestyle that suits a regime . "
future carl clarke , reader in clinical neurology at the university of birmingham said patients should understand the progression of the disease , and realise that it is not all bleak .
" it is important that people do n't see a diagnosis of parkinson 's as the end , " he said .
" although parkinson 's is a progressive condition without a cure , symptoms often progress slowly and there are lots of treatments available which mean that people may continue to live with well-controlled symptoms for many years . "
hugo middlemas , of the parkinson 's disease society , which will receive a donation out of the profits from the book , said : " it 's fantastic that barry has decided to share his story to raise money to help others living with the condition .
" although everybody with parkinson 's is different , and his story is a personal one , i am sure that this book will motivate others who have been recently diagnosed to continue to lead an active life . "

the amount of sanitary litter found by the volunteers who surveyed 60 beaches was three times the uk average .
the marine conservation society said the worst culprits were east bay beach at helensburgh and the saltings to bowling stretch in west dunbartonshire .
the pressure group blamed the number of discarded cotton buds and tampons which had been flushed down toilets .
this should be such an easy environmental issue to resolve and yet the public message is still not getting across calum duncan marine conservation society send us your views the mcs beachwatch 2006 report said levels were the highest recorded since the survey began in 1994 .
calum duncan , mcs scottish conservation manager , said : " cotton bud sticks and other sewage related debris on our beaches are not only disgusting to look at , but since the majority of these products are plastic , they also persist at sea for many years .
" this should be such an easy environmental issue to resolve and yet the public message is still not getting across - do n't use your toilet as a wet dustbin .
" individuals have a responsibility to bag it and bin it - never flush it . "
visitors ' litter he said the worst offending scottish beaches were both on the firth of clyde , where one of the biggest conurbations in the uk was situated .
a total of 946 volunteers took part in the clean up operation at 63 beaches in scotland last year .
after sewage-related debris , rubbish dropped by beach visitors was the next biggest source of litter , followed by fishing debris .
on average 2,091 items of litter of all types were found per kilometre of beach - more than the uk average of 1,988 .
more than 60 of scotland 's beaches were monitored some of the more unusual items found during the uk survey included a boomerang , a road sign , and a plastic t-rex toy .
colin bayes , the director of environmental protection and improvement with the scottish environment protection agency -lrb- sepa -rrb- , said the study had highlighted two causes for concern .
he said these were " a small number of sewage trouble spots , which are under investigation , and an indication that many individuals continue to spoil the environment for the rest of us " .
he said bathing waters were improving each year , but that litter and rubbish lessened the enjoyment of a day at the beach .
he added that a plan was being developed to address the problems in areas like bowling .

the analysis by the bank of scotland said the cost had increased by 173 % to £ 2,218 per square metre .
prices had also risen by 133 % in glasgow and 132 % in inverness over the last decade .
dundee , aberdeen and stirling have also seen increases of more than 100 % since 1996 , with prices soaring by 26 % in aberdeen in a single year .
martin ellis , chief economist at bank of scotland , said : " aberdeen has one of the highest increases per square metre over a one-year period across the uk , only falling behind armagh , newry , belfast , lisburn and londonderry . "

meanwhile , research by housing charity shelter said it had become 65 % harder for first time buyers to get onto the property ladder in scotland over the last decade .
its roof magazine assessed housing affordability by comparing mortgage costs against household 's incomes .
shelter scotland director archie stoddart said : " these figures show that the gulf between those who can afford to buy and those who ca n't is widening at an alarming rate .
" for first time buyers , the housing ladder is becoming a housing tightrope .
" buying a home is becoming an ever-more distant dream for first time buyers and as housing becomes increasingly unaffordable , we fear that repossessions are likely to spiral and more families will face the nightmare of homelessness . "
a shelter campaign has called for 30,000 new rentable homes to be built in scotland .
people are urged to show their support for the " it 's time to get a move in " initiative by displaying a charity sticker on their front door .

its concern follows on from a study of quiver trees , a slow-growing desert plant found in namibia that can live for hundreds of years .
the group from the south african national biodiversity institute found quiver trees located in hotter northern parts of the country were struggling to survive in the drought conditions the area was experiencing .
however , the trees -lrb- aloe dichotoma -rrb- growing further south , in cooler temperatures , were in much better condition . "
we 're asking sedentary organisms ... to suddenly become able to move - that 's a tough ask " guy midgley guy midgley , one of the scientists involved in the study , said it offered an insight into the future impact of climate change on plant species .
" it highlights the whole problem of migration for organisms that are essentially sedentary , " he told the television trust for the environment 's earth watch programme .
" we 're asking sedentary organisms , which have achieved an equilibrium with the climate for thousands of years , to suddenly become able to move - that 's a tough ask . "
quivers in the heat the reason the researchers chose the quiver tree as the study 's subject is because it is only found within a 2,000km -lrb- 1,200 mile -rrb- range in the southern hemisphere , between 22 and 33 degrees of latitude .
mr midgley 's colleague , wendy foden , has surveyed 54 sites and more than 6,000 trees to assess the health of the quivers . "
i think now the world has really woken up and realised that climate change is real and it 's happening " wendy foden in the northern range , she found a disproportionate number of dead or dying trees .
the cause of death could have been the result of a fungal infection or animal damage , but because there was no obvious cause , she increasingly suspects drought and heat stress .
the drought in the region has been so severe that quiver trees are struggling to survive .
at the southern end of the growing range , the trees are thriving and hundreds of saplings are taking root .
however , the scientists say climate change models suggest temperatures in the area are set to increase by 2c -lrb- 3.6f -rrb- , leading to conditions similar to those currently found in the northern range .
experiments carried out by the scientists showed that a 2c rise in temperatures caused heat stress in the trees , shutting down the plants ' photosynthesis .
without photosynthesis , the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into energy , the trees effectively starve .
wendy foden has discovered that quiver trees have begun to migrate southwards as a result of changes to the climate .
but she voiced concern that the plants , which only germinate every 15 years , might not be able to cover the distances needed to stay within a suitable temperature range .
" if they 're only reproducing every 15 years , they 're going to need to go 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- in that time to actually keep within their range , " she said .
" i think now the world has really woken up and realised that climate change is real and it 's happening ... we 've just got to figure out what we do about it . "

its concern follows on from a study of quiver trees , a slow-growing desert plant found in namibia that can live for hundreds of years .
the group from the south african national biodiversity institute found quiver trees located in hotter northern parts of the country were struggling to survive in the drought conditions the area was experiencing .
however , the trees -lrb- aloe dichotoma -rrb- growing further south , in cooler temperatures , were in much better condition .
we 're asking sedentary organisms ... to suddenly become able to move - that 's a tough ask guy midgley guy midgley , one of the scientists involved in the study , said it offered an insight into the future impact of climate change on plant species .
" it highlights the whole problem of migration for organisms that are essentially sedentary , " he told the television trust for the environment 's earth watch programme .
" we 're asking sedentary organisms , which have achieved an equilibrium with the climate for thousands of years , to suddenly become able to move - that 's a tough ask . "
quivers in the heat the reason the researchers chose the quiver tree as the study 's subject is because it is only found within a 2,000km -lrb- 1,200 mile -rrb- range in the southern hemisphere , between 22 and 33 degrees of latitude .
mr midgley 's colleague , wendy foden , has surveyed 54 sites and more than 6,000 trees to assess the health of the quivers .
i think now the world has really woken up and realised that climate change is real and it 's happening wendy foden in the northern range , she found a disproportionate number of dead or dying trees .
the cause of death could have been the result of a fungal infection or animal damage , but because there was no obvious cause , she increasingly suspects drought and heat stress .
the drought in the region has been so severe that quiver trees are struggling to survive .
at the southern end of the growing range , the trees are thriving and hundreds of saplings are taking root .
however , the scientists say climate change models suggest temperatures in the area are set to increase by 2c -lrb- 3.6f -rrb- , leading to conditions similar to those currently found in the northern range .
experiments carried out by the scientists showed that a 2c rise in temperatures caused heat stress in the trees , shutting down the plants ' photosynthesis .
without photosynthesis , the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into energy , the trees effectively starve .
wendy foden has discovered that quiver trees have begun to migrate southwards as a result of changes to the climate .
but she voiced concern that the plants , which only germinate every 15 years , might not be able to cover the distances needed to stay within a suitable temperature range .
" if they 're only reproducing every 15 years , they 're going to need to go 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- in that time to actually keep within their range , " she said .
" i think now the world has really woken up and realised that climate change is real and it 's happening ... we 've just got to figure out what we do about it . "
the television trust for the environment 's -lrb- tve -rrb- earth report - all of a quiver - will be broadcast on bbc world between 20-21 april 2007 .

the study says high blood pressure is rife , and implicates modern , frantic lifestyles , warning many under-estimate the problem at their peril .
the team of international experts warns that one in four adults already has the condition - but if nothing is done that figure could rise by 60 % over 20 years .
the study was unveiled at the european parliament in brussels .
high blood pressure can severely damage major organs , and lead to heart attacks , kidney disease and dementia a major reason for failure to control it is the refusal of up to 50 % of patients to take prescribed medication and stick to recommended lifestyle changes risk factors include smoking , high intake of salt and fat , excessive alcohol intake , and obesity the researchers say much more work is needed to tackle high blood pressure - not least a switch to healthier , less hectic lifestyles .
they warn that unless people modify their lifestyles , and diagnosis and treatment improve , recent gains in treating cardiovascular disease could be reversed .
they report says that every year , high blood pressure is implicated in an estimated 7.1 million deaths worldwide .
the problem is growing most rapidly in emerging countries with westernised economies , such as brazil , china , india , russia , turkey and the central european states .
economic impact researcher dr panos kanavos , of the london school of economics , said it was wrong to think that high blood pressure only affected older people .
he said : " uncontrolled high blood pressure among people in their 30s , 40s and 50s will inevitably lead to an increase in cardiovascular disease and stroke that will strike down men and women at the height of their earning power , potentially turning them from drivers of economic growth and sources of public revenues to long-term recipients of extensive social benefits with increased healthcare needs . "
dr kanavos called for a concerted public policy effort aimed at earlier hypertension diagnosis , and tackling its underlying causes .
june davison , cardiac nurse at the british heart foundation said it was clear that high blood pressure was a major risk factor for developing heart disease .
" for some people , being under constant stress can contribute to developing high blood pressure .
" stress can also affect your lifestyle , and may lead to unhealthy habits such as smoking , eating a poor diet , drinking too much alcohol and not getting enough exercise - adding to your risk of developing heart problems .
" it is important to identify the things that cause you stress and look at how you may deal with stressful situations .
" making changes to your lifestyle such taking regular exercise can help you cope with stress . "

as far as i 'm concerned , profiteering from a festival and its supporters is a really bad way to make a living .
we have been playing with this touting problem for two or three years now .
last time we had a separate photo id and personal identification system and it was all very complicated .
so the only real way of doing it was to put a photograph on every ticket .
it 's very simple ... because the technology is there to transfer the photograph to the ticket , and because quality of print is so good , the person can be easily identified .
photo id , i think , is fantastic .
as far as i can see it is 100 % perfect and i am thrilled with the result .
i thought there may be more teething problems , but the only real problem has been the disappointed people who pre-registered but could not get tickets .
i have only had six letters of complaint , which is not a lot out of 120,000 people .
they did n't get a ticket and spent £ 6 on a photograph .
that 's rough , but there was no other way of doing it .
but people realised what we were striving for , and i was very keen to make sure they do n't get sold on .
the public by-and-large bought the idea and went along with it .
they were as enthusiastic as i was .
across the whole entertainment industry where you have touting problems , it is a very simple solution .
it does n't cost more than about £ 1 , so it 's not serious money .
it 's rubbish -lsb- for promoters -rsb- to say it 's too expensive .
their handling charge would cover it easily .
everyone should do it , basically .
just one single registration for the whole of the summer should cover it .
i know some promoters are keen to look at it .
i was talking to one chap the other day who said he was keen to see the whole process through to find out what happens , but someone else said ' no way , we do n't want as much control as that ' .
the problem is it offers them too much control for some people , but we needed that control .
there have always been too many people trying to get in to the festival .
this year the people who have actually bought the tickets in the first place are the ones who are coming to the show .
they wo n't change hands two or three times , and so the touts did n't buy them the start with .
there is nothing on ebay , but i see someone did a face transplant offer for £ 2,000 - that 's the best thing that 's come up !
it 's the real festival-goer who actually buys in right from the start , so there is no scope for the touts to get in on day one .
and those people love the festival so much that they would not sell their ticket anyway .
not for all the tea in china .

as far as i 'm concerned , profiteering from a festival and its supporters is a really bad way to make a living .
we have been playing with this touting problem for two or three years now .
last time we had a separate photo id and personal identification system and it was all very complicated .
so the only real way of doing it was to put a photograph on every ticket .
it 's very simple ... because the technology is there to transfer the photograph to the ticket , and because quality of print is so good , the person can be easily identified .
photo id , i think , is fantastic .
