program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 27.12.2007 serbia to shun eu path if kosovo independence recognized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's parliament said it would " reconsider " diplomatic ties with kosovo supporters serbia said it would reject any offer of membership of the european union or nato if they recognized the breakaway province of kosovo as an independent state , raising the stakes in a long-standing diplomatic battle . serbia 's national assembly voted 220 to 14 in favor of a resolution , which stated that serbia would not sign international treaties that did not acknowledge its territorial integrity and sovereignty over kosovo .
the vote which took place on wednesday , dec 26 , was specifically referring to the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- which would move serbia along the path to eu membership should it sign on next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica said serbia will never accept kosovo 's independence as discussions began in the assembly earlier in the day , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said : " at this moment a powerful resolution which parliament will pass today must be our last line of defence from violence and unilateral independence . " both president boris tadic and prime minister kostunica , leaders of the two central parties in serbia 's center-right ruling coalition , backed the resolution , as did the nationalist radicals and socialists in the opposition . but , the discussions over the resolution pitted parliament 's nationalist and pro-western parties against each other , with analysts speculating that the debate served more as a campaign platform for presidential elections in january . " blow to serbia 's eu ambitions " the opposition liberal democratic party , led by cedomir jovanovic , rejected the resolution , saying the draft represented " a blow to serbia 's ambitions to become an eu member . " pro-western foreign minister vuk jeremic expressed hope that serbia would sign the saa by the end of january , despite the resolution , but also without forfeiting sovereignty over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belated funeral of 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war between serbs and albanian guerrillas serbia said it would postpone its decision on nato membership , and said it would oppose a european union supervisory mission ready to take over from the united nations in kosovo unless it won security council approval .
russia has already blocked the move in a bid to support its serb ally . " serbia will never accept the independence of kosovo , " tadic told parliament on wednesday , adding that the diplomatic campaign against it would resume at a united nations security council meeting scheduled for jan .
9 . he also warned that if nato peacekeepers failed to protect kosovo 's minority serbs , " the serbian army is ready . " kosovo ready to declare independence most serbs live in northern kosovo - more or less already partitioned from the area dominated by the 90-percent albanian majority .
kosovars , for their part , are preparing to declare independence in the next few months , with support from the european union and the united states . the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status .
the united nations has administered kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out serb forces who had fought ethnic albanian separatists .
10,000 civilians had perished in previous clashes and 800,000 people were driven out of the country . serbia , which considers kosovo its cultural cradle , has offered the two million albanians in the breakaway province broad autonomy , but kosovars insist on total independence . war criminal thought to be in serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte earlier on wednesday , serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladmir vukcevic said that wartime bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic was hiding in his country .
he said that the " noose is tightening " around the fugitive , but said the officials did not yet know mladic 's precise location . it was the first admission by a serbian official that mladic , who is wanted for genocide and crimes against humanity for his role during the 1992-1995 war in bosnia , is in hiding in serbia .
in particular , mladic and bosnian serb wartime political leader radovan karadzic are wanted for the july 1995 massacre of some 8,000 muslim men and boys in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica . belgrade has repeatedly claimed it does not know mladic 's whereabouts .
however , carla del ponte , the outgoing chief prosecutor of the united nations war crimes court in the hague , netherlands , has insisted he is in serbia . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote which took place on wednesday , dec 26 , was specifically referring to the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- which would move serbia along the path to eu membership should it sign on next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica said serbia will never accept kosovo 's independence as discussions began in the assembly earlier in the day , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said : " at this moment a powerful resolution which parliament will pass today must be our last line of defence from violence and unilateral independence . " both president boris tadic and prime minister kostunica , leaders of the two central parties in serbia 's center-right ruling coalition , backed the resolution , as did the nationalist radicals and socialists in the opposition . but , the discussions over the resolution pitted parliament 's nationalist and pro-western parties against each other , with analysts speculating that the debate served more as a campaign platform for presidential elections in january . " blow to serbia 's eu ambitions " the opposition liberal democratic party , led by cedomir jovanovic , rejected the resolution , saying the draft represented " a blow to serbia 's ambitions to become an eu member . " pro-western foreign minister vuk jeremic expressed hope that serbia would sign the saa by the end of january , despite the resolution , but also without forfeiting sovereignty over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belated funeral of 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war between serbs and albanian guerrillas serbia said it would postpone its decision on nato membership , and said it would oppose a european union supervisory mission ready to take over from the united nations in kosovo unless it won security council approval .
russia has already blocked the move in a bid to support its serb ally . " serbia will never accept the independence of kosovo , " tadic told parliament on wednesday , adding that the diplomatic campaign against it would resume at a united nations security council meeting scheduled for jan .
9 . he also warned that if nato peacekeepers failed to protect kosovo 's minority serbs , " the serbian army is ready . " kosovo ready to declare independence most serbs live in northern kosovo - more or less already partitioned from the area dominated by the 90-percent albanian majority .
kosovars , for their part , are preparing to declare independence in the next few months , with support from the european union and the united states . the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status .
the united nations has administered kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out serb forces who had fought ethnic albanian separatists .
10,000 civilians had perished in previous clashes and 800,000 people were driven out of the country . serbia , which considers kosovo its cultural cradle , has offered the two million albanians in the breakaway province broad autonomy , but kosovars insist on total independence . war criminal thought to be in serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte earlier on wednesday , serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladmir vukcevic said that wartime bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic was hiding in his country .
he said that the " noose is tightening " around the fugitive , but said the officials did not yet know mladic 's precise location . it was the first admission by a serbian official that mladic , who is wanted for genocide and crimes against humanity for his role during the 1992-1995 war in bosnia , is in hiding in serbia .
in particular , mladic and bosnian serb wartime political leader radovan karadzic are wanted for the july 1995 massacre of some 8,000 muslim men and boys in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica . belgrade has repeatedly claimed it does not know mladic 's whereabouts .
however , carla del ponte , the outgoing chief prosecutor of the united nations war crimes court in the hague , netherlands , has insisted he is in serbia . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.12.2007 opinion : democracy in pakistan needs western support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tragic assassination of opposition leader benazir bhutto highlights the central crisis of pakistani society : democratic change in the country still needs the support of the west , says dw 's thomas bärthlein . in the aftermath of the killing of benazir bhutto , pakistan is facing difficult times .
far from being an exceptional case , this assassination is the result of the political violence which has been escalating over the last few months .
even if it is too early to talk about a civil war , this much is known : the military-dominated government has failed because it can no longer ensure public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .
in either case , it is alarming that bhutto 's assassination occurred in the city which is home to headquarters of pakistan 's military .
the incident begs the question : is there a place in which pakistanis can feel truly safe ?
it is hard to imagine that the election will now take place as planned on jan .
8 .
the security situation in the country remains precarious .
also on thursday , just before the assassination of bhutto , four people were shot dead at a political rally for another former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif .
over the past decades , pakistani society has been marked by militarism and violence , a development that has largely spilled over from neighboring afghanistan .
the western-supported war against the soviet union has strengthened not only pakistan 's military and secret services but also the country 's islamic militants .
weapons and the propensity for violence continue to spread .
militancy as an ingredient of political disputes is unfortunately still a reality of everyday life in pakistan , whether between religious , ethnic or political factions .
the way out of this spiral of violence will by no means be easy .
but it should build on the developments over the past few months in which civil society became strong in pakistan and in which lawyers and journalists established themselves as political forces amidst the growth of resentment against the military rule .
pakistan needs trustworthy civil institutions .
state of emergency , martial law and expanding the powers of the security forces would not stop the spiral of violence .
the international community , too , should insist on pakistan becoming a true democracy . thomas bärthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote which took place on wednesday , dec 26 , was specifically referring to the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- which would move serbia along the path to eu membership should it sign on next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica said serbia will never accept kosovo 's independence as discussions began in the assembly earlier in the day , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said : " at this moment a powerful resolution which parliament will pass today must be our last line of defence from violence and unilateral independence . " both president boris tadic and prime minister kostunica , leaders of the two central parties in serbia 's center-right ruling coalition , backed the resolution , as did the nationalist radicals and socialists in the opposition . but , the discussions over the resolution pitted parliament 's nationalist and pro-western parties against each other , with analysts speculating that the debate served more as a campaign platform for presidential elections in january . " blow to serbia 's eu ambitions " the opposition liberal democratic party , led by cedomir jovanovic , rejected the resolution , saying the draft represented " a blow to serbia 's ambitions to become an eu member . " pro-western foreign minister vuk jeremic expressed hope that serbia would sign the saa by the end of january , despite the resolution , but also without forfeiting sovereignty over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belated funeral of 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war between serbs and albanian guerrillas serbia said it would postpone its decision on nato membership , and said it would oppose a european union supervisory mission ready to take over from the united nations in kosovo unless it won security council approval .
russia has already blocked the move in a bid to support its serb ally . " serbia will never accept the independence of kosovo , " tadic told parliament on wednesday , adding that the diplomatic campaign against it would resume at a united nations security council meeting scheduled for jan .
9 . he also warned that if nato peacekeepers failed to protect kosovo 's minority serbs , " the serbian army is ready . " kosovo ready to declare independence most serbs live in northern kosovo - more or less already partitioned from the area dominated by the 90-percent albanian majority .
kosovars , for their part , are preparing to declare independence in the next few months , with support from the european union and the united states . the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status .
the united nations has administered kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out serb forces who had fought ethnic albanian separatists .
10,000 civilians had perished in previous clashes and 800,000 people were driven out of the country . serbia , which considers kosovo its cultural cradle , has offered the two million albanians in the breakaway province broad autonomy , but kosovars insist on total independence . war criminal thought to be in serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte earlier on wednesday , serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladmir vukcevic said that wartime bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic was hiding in his country .
he said that the " noose is tightening " around the fugitive , but said the officials did not yet know mladic 's precise location . it was the first admission by a serbian official that mladic , who is wanted for genocide and crimes against humanity for his role during the 1992-1995 war in bosnia , is in hiding in serbia .
in particular , mladic and bosnian serb wartime political leader radovan karadzic are wanted for the july 1995 massacre of some 8,000 muslim men and boys in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica . belgrade has repeatedly claimed it does not know mladic 's whereabouts .
however , carla del ponte , the outgoing chief prosecutor of the united nations war crimes court in the hague , netherlands , has insisted he is in serbia . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

far from being an exceptional case , this assassination is the result of the political violence which has been escalating over the last few months .
even if it is too early to talk about a civil war , this much is known : the military-dominated government has failed because it can no longer ensure public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .
in either case , it is alarming that bhutto 's assassination occurred in the city which is home to headquarters of pakistan 's military .
the incident begs the question : is there a place in which pakistanis can feel truly safe ?
it is hard to imagine that the election will now take place as planned on jan .

the security situation in the country remains precarious .
also on thursday , just before the assassination of bhutto , four people were shot dead at a political rally for another former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif .

the western-supported war against the soviet union has strengthened not only pakistan 's military and secret services but also the country 's islamic militants .
weapons and the propensity for violence continue to spread .
militancy as an ingredient of political disputes is unfortunately still a reality of everyday life in pakistan , whether between religious , ethnic or political factions .
the way out of this spiral of violence will by no means be easy .
but it should build on the developments over the past few months in which civil society became strong in pakistan and in which lawyers and journalists established themselves as political forces amidst the growth of resentment against the military rule .
pakistan needs trustworthy civil institutions .

far from being an exceptional case , this assassination is the result of the political violence which has been escalating over the last few months .
even if it is too early to talk about a civil war , this much is known : the military-dominated government has failed because it can no longer ensure public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .
in either case , it is alarming that bhutto 's assassination occurred in the city which is home to headquarters of pakistan 's military .
the incident begs the question : is there a place in which pakistanis can feel truly safe ?
it is hard to imagine that the election will now take place as planned on jan .
8 .
the security situation in the country remains precarious .
also on thursday , just before the assassination of bhutto , four people were shot dead at a political rally for another former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif .
over the past decades , pakistani society has been marked by militarism and violence , a development that has largely spilled over from neighboring afghanistan .
the western-supported war against the soviet union has strengthened not only pakistan 's military and secret services but also the country 's islamic militants .
weapons and the propensity for violence continue to spread .
militancy as an ingredient of political disputes is unfortunately still a reality of everyday life in pakistan , whether between religious , ethnic or political factions .
the way out of this spiral of violence will by no means be easy .
but it should build on the developments over the past few months in which civil society became strong in pakistan and in which lawyers and journalists established themselves as political forces amidst the growth of resentment against the military rule .
pakistan needs trustworthy civil institutions .
state of emergency , martial law and expanding the powers of the security forces would not stop the spiral of violence .
the international community , too , should insist on pakistan becoming a true democracy . thomas bärthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

far from being an exceptional case , this assassination is the result of the political violence which has been escalating over the last few months .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .

the vote which took place on wednesday , dec 26 , was specifically referring to the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- which would move serbia along the path to eu membership should it sign on next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica said serbia will never accept kosovo 's independence as discussions began in the assembly earlier in the day , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said : " at this moment a powerful resolution which parliament will pass today must be our last line of defence from violence and unilateral independence . " both president boris tadic and prime minister kostunica , leaders of the two central parties in serbia 's center-right ruling coalition , backed the resolution , as did the nationalist radicals and socialists in the opposition . but , the discussions over the resolution pitted parliament 's nationalist and pro-western parties against each other , with analysts speculating that the debate served more as a campaign platform for presidential elections in january .

alex agopian , one of the festival organisers , explained why they had chosen to focus on southeast asia : " it ’ s a very exciting region and although you maybe hear news from these regions , it ’ s mostly catastrophic news and you don ’ t really get an insight into this culture , which is so rich and provides so many interesting stories that it would be a pity not to show them . "

i got most of my education from the movies that i saw - all kinds of education .
i didn ’ t get it from my family , i didn ’ t get it from my schools .
i ended up wanting to make films to give the same inspiration to people . "
educating and inspiring people is what cinema is all about after all .

alcoholic stupor in the philippines .
loneliness in singapore .

these are just some of the themes explored by the young southeast asian filmmakers recently showcased by cineasia cologne .
alex agopian , one of the festival organisers , explained why they had chosen to focus on southeast asia : " it ’ s a very exciting region and although you maybe hear news from these regions , it ’ s mostly catastrophic news and you don ’ t really get an insight into this culture , which is so rich and provides so many interesting stories that it would be a pity not to show them . "
countering horror john badalu , an indonesian film expert and the organiser of jakarta ’ s gay and lesbian film festival , explained young talented filmmakers with an advertising background were now hitting the international festival circuit and going against the mainstream that tended to cater to a young impressionable audience .

film as inspiration joko gave another reason for making films : " i grew up in a very bad area of a city called medan in north sumatra .
nobody went to school and everybody was doing crime . "
" my family wasn ’ t a happy family so i saw the cinema as the only way to escape from that reality and watch different kinds of worlds .
i got most of my education from the movies that i saw - all kinds of education .
i didn ’ t get it from my family , i didn ’ t get it from my schools .
i ended up wanting to make films to give the same inspiration to people . "
educating and inspiring people is what cinema is all about after all .
and regardless where the film is from " a good film is a good film , " joko anwar added with a smile .

festival audiences are flocking to see malaysian adaptations of shakespeare or filipino films asking existential questions .

alcoholic stupor in the philippines .
loneliness in singapore .
or corruption in indonesia .
these are just some of the themes explored by the young southeast asian filmmakers recently showcased by cineasia cologne .
alex agopian , one of the festival organisers , explained why they had chosen to focus on southeast asia : " it ’ s a very exciting region and although you maybe hear news from these regions , it ’ s mostly catastrophic news and you don ’ t really get an insight into this culture , which is so rich and provides so many interesting stories that it would be a pity not to show them . "
countering horror john badalu , an indonesian film expert and the organiser of jakarta ’ s gay and lesbian film festival , explained young talented filmmakers with an advertising background were now hitting the international festival circuit and going against the mainstream that tended to cater to a young impressionable audience .
" southeast asian cinema is mostly dominated by horror films and also teenage love stories in general , " he lamented .

" it ’ s propaganda from the new order era , " he complained .
" everything that comes from outside of indonesia is bad and everything from inside our culture is good - i don ’ t think that ’ s true . "
film as inspiration joko gave another reason for making films : " i grew up in a very bad area of a city called medan in north sumatra .
nobody went to school and everybody was doing crime . "
" my family wasn ’ t a happy family so i saw the cinema as the only way to escape from that reality and watch different kinds of worlds .
i got most of my education from the movies that i saw - all kinds of education .
i didn ’ t get it from my family , i didn ’ t get it from my schools .
i ended up wanting to make films to give the same inspiration to people . "
educating and inspiring people is what cinema is all about after all .
and regardless where the film is from " a good film is a good film , " joko anwar added with a smile .
generally , the audience in cologne seemed to agree with the festival organisers that southeast asian cinema is " good " cinema , whether it is about finding love in malaysia , re-writing history in vietnam , tangled relationships in singapore or breaking conventions in indonesia . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 author arundhati roy could face sedition charges over kashmir comments .

alex agopian , one of the festival organisers , explained why they had chosen to focus on southeast asia : " it ’ s a very exciting region and although you maybe hear news from these regions , it ’ s mostly catastrophic news and you don ’ t really get an insight into this culture , which is so rich and provides so many interesting stories that it would be a pity not to show them .

" it ’ s propaganda from the new order era , " he complained .
" everything that comes from outside of indonesia is bad and everything from inside our culture is good - i don ’ t think that ’ s true . "
film as inspiration joko gave another reason for making films : " i grew up in a very bad area of a city called medan in north sumatra .
nobody went to school and everybody was doing crime . "
" my family wasn ’ t a happy family so i saw the cinema as the only way to escape from that reality and watch different kinds of worlds .
i got most of my education from the movies that i saw - all kinds of education .
i didn ’ t get it from my family , i didn ’ t get it from my schools .
i ended up wanting to make films to give the same inspiration to people . "
educating and inspiring people is what cinema is all about after all .
and regardless where the film is from " a good film is a good film , " joko anwar added with a smile .
generally , the audience in cologne seemed to agree with the festival organisers that southeast asian cinema is " good " cinema , whether it is about finding love in malaysia , re-writing history in vietnam , tangled relationships in singapore or breaking conventions in indonesia . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 health the world health organization has published its first report on neglected tropical diseases .

far from being an exceptional case , this assassination is the result of the political violence which has been escalating over the last few months .
even if it is too early to talk about a civil war , this much is known : the military-dominated government has failed because it can no longer ensure public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .
in either case , it is alarming that bhutto 's assassination occurred in the city which is home to headquarters of pakistan 's military .
the incident begs the question : is there a place in which pakistanis can feel truly safe ?
it is hard to imagine that the election will now take place as planned on jan .
8 .
the security situation in the country remains precarious .
also on thursday , just before the assassination of bhutto , four people were shot dead at a political rally for another former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif .
over the past decades , pakistani society has been marked by militarism and violence , a development that has largely spilled over from neighboring afghanistan .
the western-supported war against the soviet union has strengthened not only pakistan 's military and secret services but also the country 's islamic militants .
weapons and the propensity for violence continue to spread .
militancy as an ingredient of political disputes is unfortunately still a reality of everyday life in pakistan , whether between religious , ethnic or political factions .
the way out of this spiral of violence will by no means be easy .
but it should build on the developments over the past few months in which civil society became strong in pakistan and in which lawyers and journalists established themselves as political forces amidst the growth of resentment against the military rule .
pakistan needs trustworthy civil institutions .
state of emergency , martial law and expanding the powers of the security forces would not stop the spiral of violence .
the international community , too , should insist on pakistan becoming a true democracy . thomas bärthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the un security council emerged from an emergency session on the killing with a statement condemning " this heinous act of terrorism . " italian prime minister romano prodi condemned the " fanaticism " that caused it and spain spoke of a " frontal attack on pakistani democracy . " in a statement , german chancellor angela merkel said the " cowardly act underscored the need to continue the fight against terrorism and support those who suffer its consequences . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the death of bhutto was a " severe blow " to everyone in pakistan who is fighting for democracy . he appealed to those in power to make a contribution to the stability of pakistan and ensure that next month 's elections are free and fair . bhutto killed after election rally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of bhutto mourns her death benazir bhutto , a two-time former prime minister , was killed in a suicide bomb attack after a rally in the city of rawalpindi .

" afghan president hamid karzai , who had met with bhutto just hours before thursday 's assassination , described the assassination as an " act of cowardice and immense brutality . " " -lsb- bhutto -rsb- sacrificed her life for the sake of pakistan and for the sake of the region , " karzai told a news briefing called in reaction to the assassination . us president bush called on pakistanis to continue on the road towards democracy . " the us strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine pakistan 's democracy , " bush told reporters hours after the assassination .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .
in either case , it is alarming that bhutto 's assassination occurred in the city which is home to headquarters of pakistan 's military .
the incident begs the question : is there a place in which pakistanis can feel truly safe ?
it is hard to imagine that the election will now take place as planned on jan .
8 .
the security situation in the country remains precarious .
also on thursday , just before the assassination of bhutto , four people were shot dead at a political rally for another former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif .
over the past decades , pakistani society has been marked by militarism and violence , a development that has largely spilled over from neighboring afghanistan .
the western-supported war against the soviet union has strengthened not only pakistan 's military and secret services but also the country 's islamic militants .
weapons and the propensity for violence continue to spread .
militancy as an ingredient of political disputes is unfortunately still a reality of everyday life in pakistan , whether between religious , ethnic or political factions .
the way out of this spiral of violence will by no means be easy .
but it should build on the developments over the past few months in which civil society became strong in pakistan and in which lawyers and journalists established themselves as political forces amidst the growth of resentment against the military rule .
pakistan needs trustworthy civil institutions .
state of emergency , martial law and expanding the powers of the security forces would not stop the spiral of violence .
the international community , too , should insist on pakistan becoming a true democracy . thomas bärthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote which took place on wednesday , dec 26 , was specifically referring to the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- which would move serbia along the path to eu membership should it sign on next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica said serbia will never accept kosovo 's independence as discussions began in the assembly earlier in the day , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said : " at this moment a powerful resolution which parliament will pass today must be our last line of defence from violence and unilateral independence . " both president boris tadic and prime minister kostunica , leaders of the two central parties in serbia 's center-right ruling coalition , backed the resolution , as did the nationalist radicals and socialists in the opposition . but , the discussions over the resolution pitted parliament 's nationalist and pro-western parties against each other , with analysts speculating that the debate served more as a campaign platform for presidential elections in january . " blow to serbia 's eu ambitions " the opposition liberal democratic party , led by cedomir jovanovic , rejected the resolution , saying the draft represented " a blow to serbia 's ambitions to become an eu member . " pro-western foreign minister vuk jeremic expressed hope that serbia would sign the saa by the end of january , despite the resolution , but also without forfeiting sovereignty over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belated funeral of 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war between serbs and albanian guerrillas serbia said it would postpone its decision on nato membership , and said it would oppose a european union supervisory mission ready to take over from the united nations in kosovo unless it won security council approval .
russia has already blocked the move in a bid to support its serb ally . " serbia will never accept the independence of kosovo , " tadic told parliament on wednesday , adding that the diplomatic campaign against it would resume at a united nations security council meeting scheduled for jan .
9 . he also warned that if nato peacekeepers failed to protect kosovo 's minority serbs , " the serbian army is ready . " kosovo ready to declare independence most serbs live in northern kosovo - more or less already partitioned from the area dominated by the 90-percent albanian majority .
kosovars , for their part , are preparing to declare independence in the next few months , with support from the european union and the united states . the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status .
the united nations has administered kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out serb forces who had fought ethnic albanian separatists .
10,000 civilians had perished in previous clashes and 800,000 people were driven out of the country . serbia , which considers kosovo its cultural cradle , has offered the two million albanians in the breakaway province broad autonomy , but kosovars insist on total independence . war criminal thought to be in serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte earlier on wednesday , serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladmir vukcevic said that wartime bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic was hiding in his country .
he said that the " noose is tightening " around the fugitive , but said the officials did not yet know mladic 's precise location . it was the first admission by a serbian official that mladic , who is wanted for genocide and crimes against humanity for his role during the 1992-1995 war in bosnia , is in hiding in serbia .
in particular , mladic and bosnian serb wartime political leader radovan karadzic are wanted for the july 1995 massacre of some 8,000 muslim men and boys in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica . belgrade has repeatedly claimed it does not know mladic 's whereabouts .
however , carla del ponte , the outgoing chief prosecutor of the united nations war crimes court in the hague , netherlands , has insisted he is in serbia . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote which took place on wednesday , dec 26 , was specifically referring to the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- which would move serbia along the path to eu membership should it sign on next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica said serbia will never accept kosovo 's independence as discussions began in the assembly earlier in the day , serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said : " at this moment a powerful resolution which parliament will pass today must be our last line of defence from violence and unilateral independence . " both president boris tadic and prime minister kostunica , leaders of the two central parties in serbia 's center-right ruling coalition , backed the resolution , as did the nationalist radicals and socialists in the opposition . but , the discussions over the resolution pitted parliament 's nationalist and pro-western parties against each other , with analysts speculating that the debate served more as a campaign platform for presidential elections in january . " blow to serbia 's eu ambitions " the opposition liberal democratic party , led by cedomir jovanovic , rejected the resolution , saying the draft represented " a blow to serbia 's ambitions to become an eu member . " pro-western foreign minister vuk jeremic expressed hope that serbia would sign the saa by the end of january , despite the resolution , but also without forfeiting sovereignty over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belated funeral of 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war between serbs and albanian guerrillas serbia said it would postpone its decision on nato membership , and said it would oppose a european union supervisory mission ready to take over from the united nations in kosovo unless it won security council approval .
russia has already blocked the move in a bid to support its serb ally . " serbia will never accept the independence of kosovo , " tadic told parliament on wednesday , adding that the diplomatic campaign against it would resume at a united nations security council meeting scheduled for jan .
9 . he also warned that if nato peacekeepers failed to protect kosovo 's minority serbs , " the serbian army is ready . " kosovo ready to declare independence most serbs live in northern kosovo - more or less already partitioned from the area dominated by the 90-percent albanian majority .
kosovars , for their part , are preparing to declare independence in the next few months , with support from the european union and the united states . the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status .
the united nations has administered kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out serb forces who had fought ethnic albanian separatists .
10,000 civilians had perished in previous clashes and 800,000 people were driven out of the country . serbia , which considers kosovo its cultural cradle , has offered the two million albanians in the breakaway province broad autonomy , but kosovars insist on total independence . war criminal thought to be in serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte earlier on wednesday , serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladmir vukcevic said that wartime bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic was hiding in his country .
he said that the " noose is tightening " around the fugitive , but said the officials did not yet know mladic 's precise location . it was the first admission by a serbian official that mladic , who is wanted for genocide and crimes against humanity for his role during the 1992-1995 war in bosnia , is in hiding in serbia .
in particular , mladic and bosnian serb wartime political leader radovan karadzic are wanted for the july 1995 massacre of some 8,000 muslim men and boys in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica . belgrade has repeatedly claimed it does not know mladic 's whereabouts .
however , carla del ponte , the outgoing chief prosecutor of the united nations war crimes court in the hague , netherlands , has insisted he is in serbia . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 27.12.2007 exploring southeast asian film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from joko anwar 's " kala " - indonesia 's first film noir southeast asian cinema is becoming increasingly popular in europe .
festival audiences are flocking to see malaysian adaptations of shakespeare or filipino films asking existential questions .
germany now has its very own annual southeast asian film festival in cologne . jealousy , sex and death in malaysia .
alcoholic stupor in the philippines .
loneliness in singapore .
or corruption in indonesia .
these are just some of the themes explored by the young southeast asian filmmakers recently showcased by cineasia cologne .
alex agopian , one of the festival organisers , explained why they had chosen to focus on southeast asia : " it ’ s a very exciting region and although you maybe hear news from these regions , it ’ s mostly catastrophic news and you don ’ t really get an insight into this culture , which is so rich and provides so many interesting stories that it would be a pity not to show them . "
countering horror john badalu , an indonesian film expert and the organiser of jakarta ’ s gay and lesbian film festival , explained young talented filmmakers with an advertising background were now hitting the international festival circuit and going against the mainstream that tended to cater to a young impressionable audience .
" southeast asian cinema is mostly dominated by horror films and also teenage love stories in general , " he lamented .
" most countries - indonesia , malaysia , even thailand - are dominated by horror films - 70 percent of all productions . "
defying the authorities " kala " or " dead time " - the latest film by critic-turned-director joko anwar takes a humorous poke at horror and love .
his examination of corruption in indonesia ’ s public sphere through the eyes of a jaded cop and a narcoleptic journalist combines audience-pleasing elements and highbrow techniques to deliver a serious message .
the upcoming director said he wanted to defy his government , which has a promotes cinema that reflects indonesian culture .
what indonesian culture joko asked ?
" it ’ s propaganda from the new order era , " he complained .
" everything that comes from outside of indonesia is bad and everything from inside our culture is good - i don ’ t think that ’ s true . "
film as inspiration joko gave another reason for making films : " i grew up in a very bad area of a city called medan in north sumatra .
nobody went to school and everybody was doing crime . "
" my family wasn ’ t a happy family so i saw the cinema as the only way to escape from that reality and watch different kinds of worlds .
i got most of my education from the movies that i saw - all kinds of education .
i didn ’ t get it from my family , i didn ’ t get it from my schools .
i ended up wanting to make films to give the same inspiration to people . "
educating and inspiring people is what cinema is all about after all .
and regardless where the film is from " a good film is a good film , " joko anwar added with a smile .
generally , the audience in cologne seemed to agree with the festival organisers that southeast asian cinema is " good " cinema , whether it is about finding love in malaysia , re-writing history in vietnam , tangled relationships in singapore or breaking conventions in indonesia . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 thai emergency the thai government has lifted the state of emergency in bangkok .

i ended up wanting to make films to give the same inspiration to people . "
educating and inspiring people is what cinema is all about after all .

far from being an exceptional case , this assassination is the result of the political violence which has been escalating over the last few months .
even if it is too early to talk about a civil war , this much is known : the military-dominated government has failed because it can no longer ensure public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .
in either case , it is alarming that bhutto 's assassination occurred in the city which is home to headquarters of pakistan 's military .
the incident begs the question : is there a place in which pakistanis can feel truly safe ?
it is hard to imagine that the election will now take place as planned on jan .
8 .
the security situation in the country remains precarious .
also on thursday , just before the assassination of bhutto , four people were shot dead at a political rally for another former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif .
over the past decades , pakistani society has been marked by militarism and violence , a development that has largely spilled over from neighboring afghanistan .
the western-supported war against the soviet union has strengthened not only pakistan 's military and secret services but also the country 's islamic militants .
weapons and the propensity for violence continue to spread .
militancy as an ingredient of political disputes is unfortunately still a reality of everyday life in pakistan , whether between religious , ethnic or political factions .
the way out of this spiral of violence will by no means be easy .
but it should build on the developments over the past few months in which civil society became strong in pakistan and in which lawyers and journalists established themselves as political forces amidst the growth of resentment against the military rule .
pakistan needs trustworthy civil institutions .
state of emergency , martial law and expanding the powers of the security forces would not stop the spiral of violence .

far from being an exceptional case , this assassination is the result of the political violence which has been escalating over the last few months .
even if it is too early to talk about a civil war , this much is known : the military-dominated government has failed because it can no longer ensure public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .
in either case , it is alarming that bhutto 's assassination occurred in the city which is home to headquarters of pakistan 's military .
the incident begs the question : is there a place in which pakistanis can feel truly safe ?
it is hard to imagine that the election will now take place as planned on jan .
8 .
the security situation in the country remains precarious .
also on thursday , just before the assassination of bhutto , four people were shot dead at a political rally for another former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif .
over the past decades , pakistani society has been marked by militarism and violence , a development that has largely spilled over from neighboring afghanistan .
the western-supported war against the soviet union has strengthened not only pakistan 's military and secret services but also the country 's islamic militants .
weapons and the propensity for violence continue to spread .
militancy as an ingredient of political disputes is unfortunately still a reality of everyday life in pakistan , whether between religious , ethnic or political factions .
the way out of this spiral of violence will by no means be easy .
but it should build on the developments over the past few months in which civil society became strong in pakistan and in which lawyers and journalists established themselves as political forces amidst the growth of resentment against the military rule .
pakistan needs trustworthy civil institutions .
state of emergency , martial law and expanding the powers of the security forces would not stop the spiral of violence .
the international community , too , should insist on pakistan becoming a true democracy . thomas bärthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations has administered kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out serb forces who had fought ethnic albanian separatists .

festival audiences are flocking to see malaysian adaptations of shakespeare or filipino films asking existential questions .
germany now has its very own annual southeast asian film festival in cologne . jealousy , sex and death in malaysia .
alcoholic stupor in the philippines .
loneliness in singapore .
or corruption in indonesia .
these are just some of the themes explored by the young southeast asian filmmakers recently showcased by cineasia cologne .

far from being an exceptional case , this assassination is the result of the political violence which has been escalating over the last few months .
even if it is too early to talk about a civil war , this much is known : the military-dominated government has failed because it can no longer ensure public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bärthlein one can only speculate who the backers of this attack were .
on the one hand , bhutto has received threats from islamic militants for taking what many view as " pro-american " stances against the taliban and al qaeda .
on the other hand , after the deadly suicide bombing that killed over a hundred people upon her return from exile , bhutto herself accused persons with connections to the powerful military establishment and the party of president pervez musharraf of being behind the attack .
in either case , it is alarming that bhutto 's assassination occurred in the city which is home to headquarters of pakistan 's military .
the incident begs the question : is there a place in which pakistanis can feel truly safe ?
it is hard to imagine that the election will now take place as planned on jan .
8 .
the security situation in the country remains precarious .
also on thursday , just before the assassination of bhutto , four people were shot dead at a political rally for another former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif .
over the past decades , pakistani society has been marked by militarism and violence , a development that has largely spilled over from neighboring afghanistan .
the western-supported war against the soviet union has strengthened not only pakistan 's military and secret services but also the country 's islamic militants .
weapons and the propensity for violence continue to spread .
militancy as an ingredient of political disputes is unfortunately still a reality of everyday life in pakistan , whether between religious , ethnic or political factions .
the way out of this spiral of violence will by no means be easy .
but it should build on the developments over the past few months in which civil society became strong in pakistan and in which lawyers and journalists established themselves as political forces amidst the growth of resentment against the military rule .
pakistan needs trustworthy civil institutions .
state of emergency , martial law and expanding the powers of the security forces would not stop the spiral of violence .
the international community , too , should insist on pakistan becoming a true democracy . thomas bärthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stop smoking wales , an assembly government-funded service , said there had been a 20 % rise in people wanting to quit after the ban began in april .
but tony jewell , wales ' chief medical officer , said thousands more could still make use of the service .
he urged smokers to make giving up their top resolution in 2008 after the success enjoyed by others this year .
the ban on smoking in public places was enforced in wales on 2 april , leading to on-the-spot fines for those who ignore it .
smoking in wales some 6,000 people die from smoking each year it may account for eight in 10 deaths from lung cancer , three in four from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and one in five from heart disease on average , smokers die about 10 years younger 25 % of adults smoke - 27 % of men and 24 % of women 37 % of mothers smoke at some stage in their pregnancy or the year before 28 % of 15-year-old girls and 19 % of 12-year-olds regularly smoke 37 % of households with children contain at least one adult who smokes daily blaenau gwent has the highest adult smoking rate -lrb- 32 % -rrb- ; monmouthshire the lowest -lrb- 23 % -rrb- 17 % in managerial and professional households smoke , 32 % in manual occupations , and 48 % in the never-worked and long-term unemployed group treating smoking costs the nhs across the uk £ 1.5bn a year source : welsh assembly government the figures show more than 25,000 smokers have contacted stop smoking wales since 2004 .
about 70 % of smokers say they want to quit , and some half of those who go through the stop smoking wales programme , offered by the national public health service , succeeded in giving up for good .
dr jewell said : " while the number of adult smokers is falling , there are still 6,000 premature deaths each year due to smoking .
" a quarter of adults in wales still smoke - more than the uk average - and children are taking up the habit around the age of 12 . "
the chief medical officer said there is no disputing the " devastating effects " of smoking on the individual or their family and friends .
dr jewell added : " in particular , i 'd urge those who expose children to second-hand smoke to give up .
" more mothers-to-be smoke in wales than in any other part of the uk , and over a third of households with children still contain a smoker . "
the smoking ban in public places in wales was introduced in april he said smoking prevalence in wales had fallen from 35 % in 1978 to 25 % in 2007 but believed the figure could be even lower .
" we should be aiming for an intermediate goal of 17 % prevalence , as has already been achieved in sweden and california . "
stop smoking wales provides a free support programme offering local weekly meetings , delivered in gp practices , health centres , schools , workplaces , libraries and leisure centres .
julia james of stop smoking wales said : " smokers are four times more likely to stop smoking for good with help from out services than they are if they go it alone . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- the technology with impact 2007 home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : thursday , 27 december 2007 , 07:53 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version the technology with impact 2007 facebook has been successful - and controversial the last 12 months have seen plenty of talking points around technology - from the iphone , to facebook , the launch of vista and the xo laptop - but what were the developments , stories or gadgets which had the biggest impact ?
the bbc news technology team members pick out their favourite technology of 2007 .
1 .
jane wakefield 3 .
rory cellan-jones 5 .
mark ward 2 .
jonathan fildes 4 .
darren waters jane wakefield my technology of the year is , somewhat predictably , facebook .
i know it is n't the most original of picks and ever since logging on back in the summer , i have had a nagging suspicion that it is little more than a glorified form of instant messaging - only slower , but i still find it addictive .
and that comes from someone who has never updated their status and rarely uploads pictures or does anything with the various applications i sign up for .
so why do i love it ?
essentially it is about communication and people which , for me , is what technology should be all about .
it also appeals to my innate sense of curiosity and allows me to people-watch on a grand scale , on my own terms and without getting accused of staring .
on a personal level i have found it if not life-changing then definitely life-enhancing .
it reunited me with a long-lost university friend , as well as being the first place i learned of another friend 's pregnancy and saw yet more friends ' baby pics for the first time .
on a professional level it has allowed me to ' get ' social networking which , up until that point , was a vague umbrella term for something i did n't entirely understand .
i have one concern .
when instant messaging was in its infancy i was rarely disconnected but these days my account languishes .
the interesting thing for me will be to see whether the same happens for my facebook profile once the novelty wears off .
return to top of page jonathan fildes in january apple boss steve jobs launched the iphone , a device he said would " revolutionise the industry " .
and the phone certainly lived up to expectations , for some .
but , for me , the highlight of the year was a technology that has the potential to have a far greater transformative impact .
look no wires - power deliver over the air in july , us researchers showed-off a relatively simple system that could deliver energy to devices , such as laptop computers , without the need for wires .
the setup , called witricity , was able to make a 60w light bulb glow from a distance of 2m -lrb- 7ft -rrb- .
the bulb was even made to glow when obstructions such as wood and metal were placed between the transmitter and receiver .
the reason it is my technology of the year is threefold .
firstly , if the system can be refined it has the potential to banish the annoying and ever-growing tangle of wires needed to recharge today 's electronic gadgets to the past .
there are already systems on the market that use recharging pads - similar to electric toothbrush chargers - or highly directional lasers , but none that are able to flood a room with useful energy in the same way as the witricity setup .
secondly , the mit researchers were able to build and test a workable system at breakneck speed .
although the basic physics underpinning the system were well understood , the first results from their working prototype were presented to the public just eight months after the researchers had presented a paper outlining their theoretical design .
and finally , the experiment also vindicates the work of the nineteenth-century physics and engineering heavyweight nikola tesla .
he experimented with long-range wireless energy transfer , but his most ambitious attempt - a 29m high aerial known as wardenclyffe tower , in new york - failed when he ran out of money .
witricity shows that tesla was right to pursue a world without wires .
return to top of page rory cellan-jones 2007 - the year of the iphone and vista and leopard , and of more victories for the nintendo wii over the playstation3 in the console wars .
for me , though , one technology has made a bigger personal impact than any other - social networking , or to be more precise , facebook .
in the first flush of my romance with facebook , i added everyone in sight - students from american universities , forty-somethings who wanted to reassure me that i was not alone , someone masquerading as patrick moore , even , god help me , pr people .
quickly i sobered up and began to ration my friendship to people i actually knew - or at least friends of friends .
and it worked .
i developed a " virtual " social life , rediscovering old contacts , hooking up with other technology journalists , even talking more to my old friends .
news arrived on my computer each morning - one colleague announced his engagement , others the end of relationships .
i felt better connected , part of a loose community where i could share as much or as little of my life as i wanted .
but in recent weeks , i have begun to wonder if facebook has peaked .
one friend - younger than me - became the first to leave , telling us it was encroaching too much on his time .
then i began to find aspects of the network increasingly irksome .
back in may , the decision to open facebook up to outside developers seemed brilliant , promising to change a simple pared-down site into a platform for your entire online life .
now , i 'm beginning to yearn for that early simplicity .
i do not want to be bitten by vampires , or stock a virtual aquarium with fish , or watch another daft youtube video sent to my funwall .
facebook 's other strategic move - the beacon advertising system - also promises to make it less attractive to users .
so are we falling out of love with facebook ?
i posed that question to my " friends " the other day .
" the novelty is wearing off .. "
" suffering seasonal facebook fatigue .. " were two comments .
another had found that all her thirty-something friends had gone .
but most reported that , while their early passion had faded , they were still enjoying running their social lives online .
so here 's my prediction - facebook will not fade away in 2008 .
but do n't expect to hear quite as much about it as you have this year .
return to top of page darren waters i 've been impressed with the iphone , seen facebook become an extension of my social life , suffered disappointed at the hands of leopard and looked on in fascination as microsoft struggled to make the best of vista .
but the technology that has had the biggest impact on me personally is rich web applications .
i know that 's more of a range of technologies - but web apps like google calendar , docs , and reader and the new photo-editing tools on flickr have made my life simpler .
i live a hybrid existence - using macs at home , and on the road , but pcs at work .
as such i have lots of issues around accessing information across two different platforms .
the programs i use for my e-mail , diary , rss feeds and photos have always been different across the two systems .
but the rise of web apps that are flexible , platform-neutral and accessible from anywhere i have a net connection has made my life almost pain-free .
the technology team plans its workload via google calendar , we have collaborated on stories and scripts using a web-based word processor and i can now get access to the latest stories via rss on my mac , pc or mobile phone and it is always synchronised .
as technologies like adobe air and google gears allow richer and richer experiences to move to the cloud , and to merge the offline and online worlds , 2008 should be even more interesting .
return to top of page mark ward my pick of the year is a pretty geeky one - but in a good way .
in late november nominet , which looks after the .uk domain , started work on a british enum directory .
enum , or telephone number mapping , does a couple of hugely important things .
it makes it possible to map net domains to telephone numbers .
this means you can look up a number just like you do a net domain .
this is important as it promises to start unifying the still , largely , separate worlds of phones and the net .
for a start this means that firms who route calls over the net , like skype , will be able to interconnect much more easily .
but that 's just the start .
given that eventually all communication could travel via the net it marks the start of a grand conjunction .
ultimately it could mean that when you have one way to contact someone you have all the ways they can be contacted .
all you will have to do is look them up like you do a website now .
the net will know .

the bbc news technology team members pick out their favourite technology of 2007 .

jane wakefield 3 .

jonathan fildes 4 .
darren waters jane wakefield my technology of the year is , somewhat predictably , facebook .
i know it is n't the most original of picks and ever since logging on back in the summer , i have had a nagging suspicion that it is little more than a glorified form of instant messaging - only slower , but i still find it addictive .
and that comes from someone who has never updated their status and rarely uploads pictures or does anything with the various applications i sign up for .
so why do i love it ?
essentially it is about communication and people which , for me , is what technology should be all about .
it also appeals to my innate sense of curiosity and allows me to people-watch on a grand scale , on my own terms and without getting accused of staring .
on a personal level i have found it if not life-changing then definitely life-enhancing .
it reunited me with a long-lost university friend , as well as being the first place i learned of another friend 's pregnancy and saw yet more friends ' baby pics for the first time .
on a professional level it has allowed me to ' get ' social networking which , up until that point , was a vague umbrella term for something i did n't entirely understand .
i have one concern .
when instant messaging was in its infancy i was rarely disconnected but these days my account languishes .
the interesting thing for me will be to see whether the same happens for my facebook profile once the novelty wears off .
return to top of page jonathan fildes in january apple boss steve jobs launched the iphone , a device he said would " revolutionise the industry " .
and the phone certainly lived up to expectations , for some .
but , for me , the highlight of the year was a technology that has the potential to have a far greater transformative impact .
look no wires - power deliver over the air in july , us researchers showed-off a relatively simple system that could deliver energy to devices , such as laptop computers , without the need for wires .
the setup , called witricity , was able to make a 60w light bulb glow from a distance of 2m -lrb- 7ft -rrb- .
the bulb was even made to glow when obstructions such as wood and metal were placed between the transmitter and receiver .
the reason it is my technology of the year is threefold .
firstly , if the system can be refined it has the potential to banish the annoying and ever-growing tangle of wires needed to recharge today 's electronic gadgets to the past .
there are already systems on the market that use recharging pads - similar to electric toothbrush chargers - or highly directional lasers , but none that are able to flood a room with useful energy in the same way as the witricity setup .
secondly , the mit researchers were able to build and test a workable system at breakneck speed .
although the basic physics underpinning the system were well understood , the first results from their working prototype were presented to the public just eight months after the researchers had presented a paper outlining their theoretical design .
and finally , the experiment also vindicates the work of the nineteenth-century physics and engineering heavyweight nikola tesla .
he experimented with long-range wireless energy transfer , but his most ambitious attempt - a 29m high aerial known as wardenclyffe tower , in new york - failed when he ran out of money .
witricity shows that tesla was right to pursue a world without wires .
return to top of page rory cellan-jones 2007 - the year of the iphone and vista and leopard , and of more victories for the nintendo wii over the playstation3 in the console wars .
for me , though , one technology has made a bigger personal impact than any other - social networking , or to be more precise , facebook .
in the first flush of my romance with facebook , i added everyone in sight - students from american universities , forty-somethings who wanted to reassure me that i was not alone , someone masquerading as patrick moore , even , god help me , pr people .
quickly i sobered up and began to ration my friendship to people i actually knew - or at least friends of friends .
and it worked .
i developed a " virtual " social life , rediscovering old contacts , hooking up with other technology journalists , even talking more to my old friends .
news arrived on my computer each morning - one colleague announced his engagement , others the end of relationships .
i felt better connected , part of a loose community where i could share as much or as little of my life as i wanted .
but in recent weeks , i have begun to wonder if facebook has peaked .
one friend - younger than me - became the first to leave , telling us it was encroaching too much on his time .
then i began to find aspects of the network increasingly irksome .
back in may , the decision to open facebook up to outside developers seemed brilliant , promising to change a simple pared-down site into a platform for your entire online life .
now , i 'm beginning to yearn for that early simplicity .
i do not want to be bitten by vampires , or stock a virtual aquarium with fish , or watch another daft youtube video sent to my funwall .
facebook 's other strategic move - the beacon advertising system - also promises to make it less attractive to users .
so are we falling out of love with facebook ?
i posed that question to my " friends " the other day .
" the novelty is wearing off .. "
" suffering seasonal facebook fatigue .. " were two comments .
another had found that all her thirty-something friends had gone .
but most reported that , while their early passion had faded , they were still enjoying running their social lives online .
so here 's my prediction - facebook will not fade away in 2008 .
but do n't expect to hear quite as much about it as you have this year .
return to top of page darren waters i 've been impressed with the iphone , seen facebook become an extension of my social life , suffered disappointed at the hands of leopard and looked on in fascination as microsoft struggled to make the best of vista .
but the technology that has had the biggest impact on me personally is rich web applications .
i know that 's more of a range of technologies - but web apps like google calendar , docs , and reader and the new photo-editing tools on flickr have made my life simpler .
i live a hybrid existence - using macs at home , and on the road , but pcs at work .
as such i have lots of issues around accessing information across two different platforms .
the programs i use for my e-mail , diary , rss feeds and photos have always been different across the two systems .
but the rise of web apps that are flexible , platform-neutral and accessible from anywhere i have a net connection has made my life almost pain-free .
the technology team plans its workload via google calendar , we have collaborated on stories and scripts using a web-based word processor and i can now get access to the latest stories via rss on my mac , pc or mobile phone and it is always synchronised .
as technologies like adobe air and google gears allow richer and richer experiences to move to the cloud , and to merge the offline and online worlds , 2008 should be even more interesting .
return to top of page mark ward my pick of the year is a pretty geeky one - but in a good way .
in late november nominet , which looks after the .uk domain , started work on a british enum directory .
enum , or telephone number mapping , does a couple of hugely important things .
it makes it possible to map net domains to telephone numbers .
this means you can look up a number just like you do a net domain .
this is important as it promises to start unifying the still , largely , separate worlds of phones and the net .
for a start this means that firms who route calls over the net , like skype , will be able to interconnect much more easily .
but that 's just the start .
given that eventually all communication could travel via the net it marks the start of a grand conjunction .
ultimately it could mean that when you have one way to contact someone you have all the ways they can be contacted .
all you will have to do is look them up like you do a website now .
the net will know .

the setup , called witricity , was able to make a 60w light bulb glow from a distance of 2m -lrb- 7ft -rrb- .
the bulb was even made to glow when obstructions such as wood and metal were placed between the transmitter and receiver .
the reason it is my technology of the year is threefold .
firstly , if the system can be refined it has the potential to banish the annoying and ever-growing tangle of wires needed to recharge today 's electronic gadgets to the past .
there are already systems on the market that use recharging pads - similar to electric toothbrush chargers - or highly directional lasers , but none that are able to flood a room with useful energy in the same way as the witricity setup .
secondly , the mit researchers were able to build and test a workable system at breakneck speed .
although the basic physics underpinning the system were well understood , the first results from their working prototype were presented to the public just eight months after the researchers had presented a paper outlining their theoretical design .
and finally , the experiment also vindicates the work of the nineteenth-century physics and engineering heavyweight nikola tesla .
he experimented with long-range wireless energy transfer , but his most ambitious attempt - a 29m high aerial known as wardenclyffe tower , in new york - failed when he ran out of money .
witricity shows that tesla was right to pursue a world without wires .

for me , though , one technology has made a bigger personal impact than any other - social networking , or to be more precise , facebook .
in the first flush of my romance with facebook , i added everyone in sight - students from american universities , forty-somethings who wanted to reassure me that i was not alone , someone masquerading as patrick moore , even , god help me , pr people .
quickly i sobered up and began to ration my friendship to people i actually knew - or at least friends of friends .
and it worked .
i developed a " virtual " social life , rediscovering old contacts , hooking up with other technology journalists , even talking more to my old friends .
news arrived on my computer each morning - one colleague announced his engagement , others the end of relationships .
i felt better connected , part of a loose community where i could share as much or as little of my life as i wanted .
but in recent weeks , i have begun to wonder if facebook has peaked .
one friend - younger than me - became the first to leave , telling us it was encroaching too much on his time .
then i began to find aspects of the network increasingly irksome .
back in may , the decision to open facebook up to outside developers seemed brilliant , promising to change a simple pared-down site into a platform for your entire online life .
now , i 'm beginning to yearn for that early simplicity .
i do not want to be bitten by vampires , or stock a virtual aquarium with fish , or watch another daft youtube video sent to my funwall .
facebook 's other strategic move - the beacon advertising system - also promises to make it less attractive to users .
so are we falling out of love with facebook ?
i posed that question to my " friends " the other day .
" the novelty is wearing off .. "
" suffering seasonal facebook fatigue .. " were two comments .
another had found that all her thirty-something friends had gone .
but most reported that , while their early passion had faded , they were still enjoying running their social lives online .
so here 's my prediction - facebook will not fade away in 2008 .
but do n't expect to hear quite as much about it as you have this year .
return to top of page darren waters i 've been impressed with the iphone , seen facebook become an extension of my social life , suffered disappointed at the hands of leopard and looked on in fascination as microsoft struggled to make the best of vista .
but the technology that has had the biggest impact on me personally is rich web applications .
i know that 's more of a range of technologies - but web apps like google calendar , docs , and reader and the new photo-editing tools on flickr have made my life simpler .
i live a hybrid existence - using macs at home , and on the road , but pcs at work .
as such i have lots of issues around accessing information across two different platforms .
the programs i use for my e-mail , diary , rss feeds and photos have always been different across the two systems .
but the rise of web apps that are flexible , platform-neutral and accessible from anywhere i have a net connection has made my life almost pain-free .
the technology team plans its workload via google calendar , we have collaborated on stories and scripts using a web-based word processor and i can now get access to the latest stories via rss on my mac , pc or mobile phone and it is always synchronised .
as technologies like adobe air and google gears allow richer and richer experiences to move to the cloud , and to merge the offline and online worlds , 2008 should be even more interesting .
return to top of page mark ward my pick of the year is a pretty geeky one - but in a good way .
in late november nominet , which looks after the .uk domain , started work on a british enum directory .
enum , or telephone number mapping , does a couple of hugely important things .
it makes it possible to map net domains to telephone numbers .
this means you can look up a number just like you do a net domain .
this is important as it promises to start unifying the still , largely , separate worlds of phones and the net .
for a start this means that firms who route calls over the net , like skype , will be able to interconnect much more easily .
but that 's just the start .
given that eventually all communication could travel via the net it marks the start of a grand conjunction .
ultimately it could mean that when you have one way to contact someone you have all the ways they can be contacted .
all you will have to do is look them up like you do a website now .
the net will know .

jonathan fildes 4 .
darren waters jane wakefield my technology of the year is , somewhat predictably , facebook .
i know it is n't the most original of picks and ever since logging on back in the summer , i have had a nagging suspicion that it is little more than a glorified form of instant messaging - only slower , but i still find it addictive .
and that comes from someone who has never updated their status and rarely uploads pictures or does anything with the various applications i sign up for .
so why do i love it ?
essentially it is about communication and people which , for me , is what technology should be all about .
it also appeals to my innate sense of curiosity and allows me to people-watch on a grand scale , on my own terms and without getting accused of staring .
on a personal level i have found it if not life-changing then definitely life-enhancing .
it reunited me with a long-lost university friend , as well as being the first place i learned of another friend 's pregnancy and saw yet more friends ' baby pics for the first time .
on a professional level it has allowed me to ' get ' social networking which , up until that point , was a vague umbrella term for something i did n't entirely understand .
i have one concern .
when instant messaging was in its infancy i was rarely disconnected but these days my account languishes .
the interesting thing for me will be to see whether the same happens for my facebook profile once the novelty wears off .

" the novelty is wearing off .. "
" suffering seasonal facebook fatigue .. " were two comments .
another had found that all her thirty-something friends had gone .
but most reported that , while their early passion had faded , they were still enjoying running their social lives online .

i know that 's more of a range of technologies - but web apps like google calendar , docs , and reader and the new photo-editing tools on flickr have made my life simpler .

enum , or telephone number mapping , does a couple of hugely important things .
it makes it possible to map net domains to telephone numbers .
this means you can look up a number just like you do a net domain .
this is important as it promises to start unifying the still , largely , separate worlds of phones and the net .

given that eventually all communication could travel via the net it marks the start of a grand conjunction .

the bbc news technology team members pick out their favourite technology of 2007 .
1 .
jane wakefield 3 .
rory cellan-jones 5 .
mark ward 2 .
jonathan fildes 4 .
darren waters jane wakefield my technology of the year is , somewhat predictably , facebook .
i know it is n't the most original of picks and ever since logging on back in the summer , i have had a nagging suspicion that it is little more than a glorified form of instant messaging - only slower , but i still find it addictive .
and that comes from someone who has never updated their status and rarely uploads pictures or does anything with the various applications i sign up for .
so why do i love it ?
essentially it is about communication and people which , for me , is what technology should be all about .
it also appeals to my innate sense of curiosity and allows me to people-watch on a grand scale , on my own terms and without getting accused of staring .
on a personal level i have found it if not life-changing then definitely life-enhancing .
it reunited me with a long-lost university friend , as well as being the first place i learned of another friend 's pregnancy and saw yet more friends ' baby pics for the first time .
on a professional level it has allowed me to ' get ' social networking which , up until that point , was a vague umbrella term for something i did n't entirely understand .
i have one concern .
when instant messaging was in its infancy i was rarely disconnected but these days my account languishes .
the interesting thing for me will be to see whether the same happens for my facebook profile once the novelty wears off .
return to top of page jonathan fildes in january apple boss steve jobs launched the iphone , a device he said would " revolutionise the industry " .
and the phone certainly lived up to expectations , for some .
but , for me , the highlight of the year was a technology that has the potential to have a far greater transformative impact .
look no wires - power deliver over the air in july , us researchers showed-off a relatively simple system that could deliver energy to devices , such as laptop computers , without the need for wires .
the setup , called witricity , was able to make a 60w light bulb glow from a distance of 2m -lrb- 7ft -rrb- .
the bulb was even made to glow when obstructions such as wood and metal were placed between the transmitter and receiver .
the reason it is my technology of the year is threefold .
firstly , if the system can be refined it has the potential to banish the annoying and ever-growing tangle of wires needed to recharge today 's electronic gadgets to the past .
there are already systems on the market that use recharging pads - similar to electric toothbrush chargers - or highly directional lasers , but none that are able to flood a room with useful energy in the same way as the witricity setup .
secondly , the mit researchers were able to build and test a workable system at breakneck speed .
although the basic physics underpinning the system were well understood , the first results from their working prototype were presented to the public just eight months after the researchers had presented a paper outlining their theoretical design .
and finally , the experiment also vindicates the work of the nineteenth-century physics and engineering heavyweight nikola tesla .
he experimented with long-range wireless energy transfer , but his most ambitious attempt - a 29m high aerial known as wardenclyffe tower , in new york - failed when he ran out of money .
witricity shows that tesla was right to pursue a world without wires .
return to top of page rory cellan-jones 2007 - the year of the iphone and vista and leopard , and of more victories for the nintendo wii over the playstation3 in the console wars .
for me , though , one technology has made a bigger personal impact than any other - social networking , or to be more precise , facebook .
in the first flush of my romance with facebook , i added everyone in sight - students from american universities , forty-somethings who wanted to reassure me that i was not alone , someone masquerading as patrick moore , even , god help me , pr people .
quickly i sobered up and began to ration my friendship to people i actually knew - or at least friends of friends .
and it worked .
i developed a " virtual " social life , rediscovering old contacts , hooking up with other technology journalists , even talking more to my old friends .
news arrived on my computer each morning - one colleague announced his engagement , others the end of relationships .
i felt better connected , part of a loose community where i could share as much or as little of my life as i wanted .
but in recent weeks , i have begun to wonder if facebook has peaked .
one friend - younger than me - became the first to leave , telling us it was encroaching too much on his time .
then i began to find aspects of the network increasingly irksome .
back in may , the decision to open facebook up to outside developers seemed brilliant , promising to change a simple pared-down site into a platform for your entire online life .
now , i 'm beginning to yearn for that early simplicity .
i do not want to be bitten by vampires , or stock a virtual aquarium with fish , or watch another daft youtube video sent to my funwall .
facebook 's other strategic move - the beacon advertising system - also promises to make it less attractive to users .

halo 3 has been a massive success for microsoft cutting-edge video games might be a dream come true for consumers around the world , but for many companies developing them , it 's been a nightmare .
the movie-like productions on sony 's playstation 3 and microsoft 's xbox 360 games have meant that the cost of producing them has risen sharply .
halo 3 , an extremely popular game produced by microsoft , is estimated to have cost $ 30m -lrb- £ 15m -rrb- .
however , the american software giant was able to recoup that , and the millions more spent on marketing , straight away .
on its first day of sales , it brought in $ 170m , setting the record for the most money earned in a day by an entertainment product .
it far outstripped the money made in a day by spiderman 3 , the biggest-grossing hollywood film .
survival game back in 1982 , the japanese company namco produced pacman for $ 100,000 .
now , the average playstation 3 title is estimated to cost $ 15m .
even after adjusting for inflation , that is still a significant rise .
it is not unlikely that after christmas , we may find there are some casualties fred hasson , european games developer federation while production costs have tripled in recent years with the introduction of next-gen consoles , sales and revenue have hardly changed .
this means that for many of the smaller games companies , staying profitable is a serious issue .
one such company is blitz games , based in leamington spa in the uk .
its founder and chief executive , philip oliver , says it 's a battle to control spiralling costs .
" these costs have risen so sharply because of the complexity of the devices which we are writing the games for , " mr oliver says .
" the costs have risen most sharply on the graphics side .
we have entered a new era of high-definition video gaming .
" this has led to team sizes having to increase in this area , for new tools to be created for this and generally the costs are rocketing .
this is actually having a severe hit on the industry . "
company bosses such as mr oliver have needed to find novel ways of funding games development .
increasingly , this means outsourcing some of the work abroad .
game over this is the biggest source for concern for the industry body , the european games developer federation -lrb- egdf -rrb- .
with profit margins so tight , the line between survival and failure can rest on the sales from just one christmas .
the fear is that many companies will simply not survive the festive period .
pacman was a blockbuster game for namco in the 1980s " it is not unlikely that after christmas , we may find there are some casualties , " says egdf chairman fred hasson .
" companies would have banked on a lot of their expenditure coming good during the christmas period , when a good quarter or more of games are sold in the uk and in europe .
" lack of success could mean downward share prices and some companies getting into difficulty . "
sink or swim not everyone is sympathetic to the woes of the smaller players in the games industry .
sony 's playstation 3 and rival consoles give a stunning game experience professor danny quah , head of economics at the london school of economics , is one of them .
he believes that we are now living in a digital economy , where almost all of the costs in starting up a new succesful product are in research and development .
" the key feature in all of these digital goods is that they are expensive to create in the first instance , hence the heavy research and development outlay , " professor quah says .
" but subsequently they are practically costless to reproduce in billions and billions of copies . "
this gives the major players like microsoft and sony an advantage .
they can afford to invest huge sums in research and development of new computer games , to make the most of the even bigger profits .
he says that this new digital economy is one of high risk and high reward .
" because of these very high upfront fixed costs , the risks that these entrepreneurs have to undertake are likely expanded from before , " he says .
" that 's not necessarily a bad thing , though .
the fact is that with risk comes reward and the two go hand in hand .
" what we see is that the economy becomes much more in-your-face , much livelier , much more real for the people who are engaged with it . "
long term winners many companies are counting on the sales to expand quickly in the coming years as these next-generation consoles become widely established in households .
there is a big market for game developers to nurture in the future " there 's long-term rewards in this , " says independent games consultant nick parker .
" these products will last five or six or seven years and will increase the number of consoles out there , driving software sales .
" obviously at the moment , it 's high-risk , because there are n't so many consoles being sold .
in the long term , there 's the opportunity to get the money back .
that 's why we are in the business . "
so , there might be money to be made at the end of it all , but for many companies now , that seems a long way away .

halo 3 has been a massive success for microsoft cutting-edge video games might be a dream come true for consumers around the world , but for many companies developing them , it 's been a nightmare .
the movie-like productions on sony 's playstation 3 and microsoft 's xbox 360 games have meant that the cost of producing them has risen sharply .
halo 3 , an extremely popular game produced by microsoft , is estimated to have cost $ 30m -lrb- £ 15m -rrb- .
however , the american software giant was able to recoup that , and the millions more spent on marketing , straight away .

cutting-edge video games might be a dream come true for consumers around the world , but for many companies developing them , it 's been a nightmare .
the movie-like productions on sony 's playstation 3 and microsoft 's xbox 360 games have meant that the cost of producing them has risen sharply .
halo 3 , an extremely popular game produced by microsoft , is estimated to have cost $ 30m -lrb- £ 15m -rrb- .
however , the american software giant was able to recoup that , and the millions more spent on marketing , straight away .
on its first day of sales , it brought in $ 170m , setting the record for the most money earned in a day by an entertainment product .
it far outstripped the money made in a day by spiderman 3 , the biggest-grossing hollywood film .
survival game back in 1982 , the japanese company namco produced pacman for $ 100,000 .
now , the average playstation 3 title is estimated to cost $ 15m .
even after adjusting for inflation , that is still a significant rise . "
it is not unlikely that after christmas , we may find there are some casualties " fred hasson , european games developer federation while production costs have tripled in recent years with the introduction of next-gen consoles , sales and revenue have hardly changed .
this means that for many of the smaller games companies , staying profitable is a serious issue .
one such company is blitz games , based in leamington spa in the uk .
its founder and chief executive , philip oliver , says it 's a battle to control spiralling costs .
" these costs have risen so sharply because of the complexity of the devices which we are writing the games for , " mr oliver says .
" the costs have risen most sharply on the graphics side .
we have entered a new era of high-definition video gaming .
" this has led to team sizes having to increase in this area , for new tools to be created for this and generally the costs are rocketing .
this is actually having a severe hit on the industry . "
company bosses such as mr oliver have needed to find novel ways of funding games development .
increasingly , this means outsourcing some of the work abroad .
game over this is the biggest source for concern for the industry body , the european games developer federation -lrb- egdf -rrb- .
with profit margins so tight , the line between survival and failure can rest on the sales from just one christmas .
the fear is that many companies will simply not survive the festive period .
" it is not unlikely that after christmas , we may find there are some casualties , " says egdf chairman fred hasson .
" companies would have banked on a lot of their expenditure coming good during the christmas period , when a good quarter or more of games are sold in the uk and in europe .
" lack of success could mean downward share prices and some companies getting into difficulty . "
sink or swim not everyone is sympathetic to the woes of the smaller players in the games industry .
professor danny quah , head of economics at the london school of economics , is one of them .
he believes that we are now living in a digital economy , where almost all of the costs in starting up a new succesful product are in research and development .
" the key feature in all of these digital goods is that they are expensive to create in the first instance , hence the heavy research and development outlay , " professor quah says .
" but subsequently they are practically costless to reproduce in billions and billions of copies . "
this gives the major players like microsoft and sony an advantage .
they can afford to invest huge sums in research and development of new computer games , to make the most of the even bigger profits .
he says that this new digital economy is one of high risk and high reward .
" because of these very high upfront fixed costs , the risks that these entrepreneurs have to undertake are likely expanded from before , " he says .
" that 's not necessarily a bad thing , though .
the fact is that with risk comes reward and the two go hand in hand .
" what we see is that the economy becomes much more in-your-face , much livelier , much more real for the people who are engaged with it . "
long term winners many companies are counting on the sales to expand quickly in the coming years as these next-generation consoles become widely established in households .
" there 's long-term rewards in this , " says independent games consultant nick parker .
" these products will last five or six or seven years and will increase the number of consoles out there , driving software sales .
" obviously at the moment , it 's high-risk , because there are n't so many consoles being sold .
in the long term , there 's the opportunity to get the money back .
that 's why we are in the business . "
so , there might be money to be made at the end of it all , but for many companies now , that seems a long way away .

the answer was yes .
most of the sub-prime lending had been done by companies that sold on their loans to other banks .
these financial institutions viewed the risks as fixed and failed to see the risks had in fact been soaring , as lending was gradually extended to people with less chance of being able to keep up their repayments .

repossessions in the us have led to global economic problems form-filling had certainly mushroomed in the wake of the dotcom scandals and the recent accounting frauds at enron and worldcom .
the complaint was that this meant lots of international business was fleeing wall street , much of it diverting to london instead .
and yet , 12 months on and there was another wave of financial regulation , this time in the housing market .
the threat of millions of americans being thrown out of their homes because they could n't afford to pay their mortgage debts forced president george w bush to take decisive action .

her mortgage repayments were perfectly affordable for the first two years , but then - to her surprise - the interest rate on her loan shot up .
" the mortgage kept rising , it started at $ 1,700 but last year - 2006 - the mortgage was almost $ 3,000 and i ended up in foreclosure , " ms fanfan told world business report .
" i feel that i trusted the people that i was working with .
as a consumer , i 'm not real estate savvy or mortgage savvy .

credit crunch ms fanfan was just one of many thousands who lost their homes in what has become known as the sub-prime crisis , as those worst affected in america were mainly low income citizens with a poor record of paying back their debts .
but could this really have global implications ?
the answer was yes .
most of the sub-prime lending had been done by companies that sold on their loans to other banks .
these financial institutions viewed the risks as fixed and failed to see the risks had in fact been soaring , as lending was gradually extended to people with less chance of being able to keep up their repayments .
the losses mounted from a few billion dollars to tens of billion dollars .
us banks , european banks , asian banks were all affected .
and it snowballed from there .
rocky times banks simply did n't trust each other - they did n't know who had the worst problems .
so interest rates for big banks went up sharply , and that was very bad news for one british bank - northern rock .
getting cash cheaply from other banks was vital to its strategy , and when that cash dried up and it emerged that the bank of england was coming to its rescue , savers queued outside its branches to withdraw their money while they could .
it caused the first run on a bank in britain for more than a century , and people up and down britain joined in .
under control at one point , fears were high of a big knock-on impact to the broader economy outside the banks .
cheap energy in china means domestic coal , which is dirty professor matthew england , a climate scientist from the university of new south wales americans felt poorer as their house prices fell , while companies globally found it tougher to raise funds for expansion projects .
but central banks around the world intervened and made billions of dollars available to the big banks to keep borrowing costs from rising too sharply .
the crisis stayed under control , and while us economic growth is currently weakening , many economists expect the us to avoid a recession .
burberry blues there was no sign of anything like a recession in china .
the country 's economy continued to boom , taking on still further the role of manufacturing centre of the world .
but as factories opened in china , at the same time they were shutting down in many parts of the us and western europe while rich countries have generally ceased manufacturing cheap goods , more upmarket brands have tended to stay .
the quality clothing maker burberry was still making polo shirts in a factory at treorchy in south wales , until it decided to close the factory , promoting this angry response from the firm 's 300 workers .
unions leaders admitted that the cost of making a shirt in wales was more than twice that in china .
but what the unions also pointed out was that the production cost in wales of around £ 11 a shirt was still well below the £ 80 a shirt that customers pay in the shops .
star support a campaign to keep the welsh factory open won support from many famous actors and the welsh-born singer tom jones .
the march of globalisation could n't be stopped , though .
burberry refused to back down and it was left to a welsh male voice choir to accompany the workers out the factory on their final shift .
more than two thirds of burberry 's manufacturing is still in europe , but the shift to cheaper locations seems unstoppable .
but what about the effect of such a shift on the environment ?
despite apparently increasing ' green ' awareness over the past year , the emissions impact still seems to have no influence on the way businesses shift work around the planet .
dirty energy china now seems to be on the point of overtaking the us as the world 's number one producer of greenhouse gasses , such as co2 , according to the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- , which advises wealthy countries on energy policy .
" china is a developing country ... and for economic growth they need cheap energy , " the iea 's chief economist fatih birol told world business report .
" cheap energy in china means domestic coal , which is dirty .
it means a lot of co2 emissions . "
professor matthew england , a climate scientist from the university of new south wales , was among those who travelled to the bali summit of world politicians in december to deliver a petition to try to stun policymakers into action .
" we have to have a radical change to the way we power this planet , " he said during the summit .
" we 've got to start reducing greenhouse gas emissions as soon as we possibly can . "
the bali meeting was meant to start a process that comes up with a successor to the kyoto treaty , which promised - but has n't delivered - modest cuts in emissions .
so far , there seems to be little sign of any desire of the world 's rich to enjoy themselves in ways that use less energy .
shanghai frenzy of course , when resources run short , then the prices goes up .
metals and many foods did see their prices rise sharply in the past year .
but there was nothing to rival the soaring value of shares on the shanghai stock market .
a frenzy of buying saw the market treble in value over the past year .
every new share issue was snapped up .
on the first day of trading on the exchange for china 's dominant oil producer , petrochina , the company saw its value soar to 60 times its earnings .
many african countries also benefited from the high global commodity prices .
world business report spoke to one successful businessman , aleeko dangote , who was described as the richest man in africa , and who has made his fortune in sugar , cement , rice , pasta , textiles and salt , as well as oil and gas .
a well connected man and major donor to nigeria 's ruling party during presidential elections earlier in the year , mr dangote told us : " the country needs to be doing well .
if the country was to be like zimbabwe for example , then i will become a poor person . "

epigenetics is the study of molecular modifications which sit on top of the dna in our cells , in effect switching our genes on and off ; telling our cells how they should behave .
scientists are now realising that if those epigenetic markings are disrupted , causing a gene to become incorrectly active or silent , a healthy cell could become diseased .
research is beginning to uncover the mechanisms behind these switches - and the circumstances under which changes occur .
this opens up a whole new area of therapy which has not been available before professor adrian bird edinburgh university it is bringing new insight into our biology , particularly the understanding of diseases such as cancer , diabetes , and schizophrenia .
" we can still explain only a small proportion of a person 's predisposition to complex disease based on genetics alone , " said vardhman rakyan , from queen mary 's school of medicine in london .
epigenetics could provide the missing link .
what is really causing excitement is the possibility of new treatments .
" the distinction between epigenetic changes and genetic changes is that epigenetic changes appear to be reversible , " said professor adrian bird from edinburgh university .
" this opens up a whole new area of therapy which has not been available before . "
cancer application epigenetics is already making a difference in cancer biology .
a tumour is a lump of cells that grow and proliferate uncontrollably , eventually invading other parts of the body .
there 's no question that almost every cancer cell has problems with the epigenetic programming professor moshe szyf mcgill university we have hundreds of genes which , when working properly , keep healthy cells in check .
these can be disrupted by damage directly to their dna - but it 's now been realised that epigenetic changes could also be responsible .
" there 's no question that almost every cancer cell has problems with the epigenetic programming , " said professor moshe szyf , from mcgill university in montreal .
so an increasing focus of research has been to find drugs which can remove these chemical changes .
a common epigenetic change in cancers is dna methylation - which silences genes .
at the md anderson cancer center in houston , texas , dr jean pierre issa has been pioneering the use of two epigenetic drug therapies - decitabine and azacitidine .
rather than killing cancer cells , these drugs remove the aberrant methylation , reactivating genes which had been silenced .
" when i was diagnosed with leukaemia , i was devastated - i thought i was going to die , " said 72-year-old nancy stanley , a texas patient who has received this treatment .
remarkable results nancy suffers from myelodysplastic syndrome -lrb- mds -rrb- , a bone marrow disorder which disrupts the formation of blood cells .
it 's predominantly caused by the methylation of one particular gene , and so has become an ideal candidate disease for epigenetic therapy .
" we have had remarkable results , " said dr issa .
epigenetics gives us a whole new way to look at the diagnosis , treatment and assessment of solid tumours dr tim crook breakthrough breast cancer " about half the patients have shown a complete disappearance of all signs and symptoms of disease . "
he cautions that this is not an absolute cure ; but is optimistic : " in mds there was no effective treatment two or three years ago - now two of the three drugs currently approved work on this epigenetic mechanism . "
the successes in mds has lead to hopes for other types of cancer .
understanding epigenetic changes may reveal how tumours develop and become malignant ; and could help explain differences in the prognosis of patients .
this in turn will allow doctors to better target cancer treatments .
" we should be very excited , " said dr tim crook , of the charity breakthrough breast cancer .
" epigenetics gives us a whole new way to look at the diagnosis , treatment and assessment of solid tumours . "

epigenetics is the study of molecular modifications which sit on top of the dna in our cells , in effect switching our genes on and off ; telling our cells how they should behave .
scientists are now realising that if those epigenetic markings are disrupted , causing a gene to become incorrectly active or silent , a healthy cell could become diseased .
research is beginning to uncover the mechanisms behind these switches - and the circumstances under which changes occur .
this opens up a whole new area of therapy which has not been available before professor adrian bird edinburgh university it is bringing new insight into our biology , particularly the understanding of diseases such as cancer , diabetes , and schizophrenia .
" we can still explain only a small proportion of a person 's predisposition to complex disease based on genetics alone , " said vardhman rakyan , from queen mary 's school of medicine in london .
epigenetics could provide the missing link .

" the distinction between epigenetic changes and genetic changes is that epigenetic changes appear to be reversible , " said professor adrian bird from edinburgh university .

cancer application epigenetics is already making a difference in cancer biology .
a tumour is a lump of cells that grow and proliferate uncontrollably , eventually invading other parts of the body .
there 's no question that almost every cancer cell has problems with the epigenetic programming professor moshe szyf mcgill university we have hundreds of genes which , when working properly , keep healthy cells in check .

" there 's no question that almost every cancer cell has problems with the epigenetic programming , " said professor moshe szyf , from mcgill university in montreal .
so an increasing focus of research has been to find drugs which can remove these chemical changes .
a common epigenetic change in cancers is dna methylation - which silences genes .
at the md anderson cancer center in houston , texas , dr jean pierre issa has been pioneering the use of two epigenetic drug therapies - decitabine and azacitidine .
rather than killing cancer cells , these drugs remove the aberrant methylation , reactivating genes which had been silenced .

and nearly 100,000 switched careers between 2000 and 2005 - more than double the number that left in the preceding five-year period .
the tories say their findings - based on government figures - point to rising numbers leaving the profession because of poor class discipline and red tape .
but schools minister jim knight said recruitment was " buoyant " .
figures also show that thousands of people who train and qualify as teachers never go on to work in schools and this appears to have increased in recent years .
the government statistics show that of those who qualified in 2000 , 2,100 never taught in schools .
this rose steadily to 2005 -lrb- the latest available -rrb- , when 7,900 of those who qualified have never taught .
no government has done more to support teachers jim knight schools minister shadow schools secretary michael gove said teaching talent was " going to waste " .
mr gove said : " not only are our children not achieving as they should , talented teachers are not where they should be - in the classroom , opening young minds to new horizons .
" with more than quarter of a million gifted professionals no longer in teaching , we have to ask why they 've given up on education under labour . "
he said teachers needed to be freed from " government micro-management " to enable them to " inspire and give them the tools to enforce discipline so that schools have access to the widest range of talent " .
' best generation ' but mr knight said teaching was now " the career of choice for many highly qualified , talented individuals " .
he went on : " ofsted has said this is the best generation of teachers ever .
" early retirement and churn in teaching is in fact good compared with equivalent professions . "
he said : " no government has done more to support teachers " .
mr knight also cited a bath university survey of 22,500 british workers which suggested that school , college and university teachers have climbed from being the 54th happiest occupation in 1999 to 11th in 2007 .
meanwhile , a spokesman for the training and development agency for schools said : " many qualified teachers decide to take a break from the profession for a number of reasons . "
the spokesman said the figures referred to by the conservatives " do not take account of the fact that up to 30,000 teachers return to teaching at a later date with added industry experience and a new enthusiasm for teaching and learning " .
but the general secretary of the nasuwt teaching union , chris keates , said mr gove 's figures were probably about right but his claims about reasons for teachers ' inactivity were wrong .
she said a pool of inactive teachers had always existed and most joined it because of career breaks or changes .
she added : " for the majority of those who leave now , evidence shows it is a positive choice . "

and nearly 100,000 switched careers between 2000 and 2005 - more than double the number that left in the preceding five-year period .
the tories say their findings - based on government figures - point to rising numbers leaving the profession because of poor class discipline and red tape .
but schools minister jim knight said recruitment was " buoyant " .
figures also show that thousands of people who train and qualify as teachers never go on to work in schools and this appears to have increased in recent years .
the government statistics show that of those who qualified in 2000 , 2,100 never taught in schools .
this rose steadily to 2005 -lrb- the latest available -rrb- , when 7,900 of those who qualified have never taught .
no government has done more to support teachers jim knight schools minister shadow schools secretary michael gove said teaching talent was " going to waste " .
mr gove said : " not only are our children not achieving as they should , talented teachers are not where they should be - in the classroom , opening young minds to new horizons .
" with more than quarter of a million gifted professionals no longer in teaching , we have to ask why they 've given up on education under labour . "
he said teachers needed to be freed from " government micro-management " to enable them to " inspire and give them the tools to enforce discipline so that schools have access to the widest range of talent " .
' best generation ' but mr knight said teaching was now " the career of choice for many highly qualified , talented individuals " .
he went on : " ofsted has said this is the best generation of teachers ever .
" early retirement and churn in teaching is in fact good compared with equivalent professions . "
he said : " no government has done more to support teachers " .
mr knight also cited a bath university survey of 22,500 british workers which suggested that school , college and university teachers have climbed from being the 54th happiest occupation in 1999 to 11th in 2007 .
meanwhile , a spokesman for the training and development agency for schools said : " many qualified teachers decide to take a break from the profession for a number of reasons . "
the spokesman said the figures referred to by the conservatives " do not take account of the fact that up to 30,000 teachers return to teaching at a later date with added industry experience and a new enthusiasm for teaching and learning " .
but the general secretary of the nasuwt teaching union , chris keates , said mr gove 's figures were probably about right but his claims about reasons for teachers ' inactivity were wrong .
she said a pool of inactive teachers had always existed and most joined it because of career breaks or changes .
she added : " for the majority of those who leave now , evidence shows it is a positive choice . "
