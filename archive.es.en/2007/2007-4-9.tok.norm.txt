but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation .

florian henkel von donnersmarck 's film " the lives of others " has swept more than 32 german and international awards including the coveted oscar for best foreign-language film . but once a german filmmaker wins serious accolades , the next question is usually : " so when are you moving to hollywood ? " according to a recent article in the german edition of the magazine vanity fair , von donnersmarck already has made the jump across the pond and is now calling a suite at the beverly wilshire hotel in los angeles home . he will be joining turkish-german director mennan yapo , whose hollywood debut " premonition , " starring sandra bullock , has raked in over $ 17 million -lrb- 13 million euros -rrb- in box office receipts since its us release just two weeks ago . this exodus of german directors may seem like the next logical step towards a successful career in an increasingly global film industry , but some directors argue that the hurdles directors face in their home country is what really entices many of them to seek their fortunes elsewhere . filmmaking german style " for directors in germany it is very hard to make a living in film and many are forced to do other jobs like commercials to survive , " said steffen schmidt-hug , director of the german film directors association , a group that works to promote and improve working conditions for directors .
" others look for work in other countries like france and america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's berlin 's golden bear versus hollywood 's golden man under the rules governing the germany film industry , directors are classified as technicians - like set designers and gaffers - and fall under strict limits regarding the amount a director can earn on each project , even if the film is a large commercial success . schmidt-hug claims these rules frustrate many filmmakers by also limiting a director 's artistic freedom by always granting a film 's final cut to the producer . " in france by law the director gets the final cut .
in america the director gets the director 's cut but not the final cut , " said schmidt-hug . " in germany the directors do not even have a directors cut . " oliver hirschbiegel , director of the critically-acclaimed film " the downfall , " has repeatedly lambasted the german film industry and famously said during a panel discussion last year that directors in germany are " paid like shit . "
he promptly packed his bags for hollywood . new money , old problems as in most european countries , the german film industry is built upon public financing .
the federal government allocates over 260 million euros for film projects each year . this includes an additional 60 million euros earmarked in the 2007 federal budget which is mean to act as an " incentive to boost film production in germany . " " the model will have a swift and direct impact on german producers and studios , " said bernd neumann , federal government commissioner for culture and media , in support of the new incentives , " and will make germany a more attractive production location for major international productions as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could charlie chaplin have gotten film funding in germany ?
but according to schmidt-hug , this system is structured in favor of established producers by setting strict criteria like requiring independent filmmakers to sign a distribution deal before allocating any funds , a difficult task for even the most experienced director . such a system puts enormous hurdles in the way of up-and-coming and inexperienced filmmakers , like von donnersmarck , for example . " in germany we have the concept of the ' struggling poet ' , " said schmidt-hug , " and people say that the artist does not need to be paid .
they get their film , their art . " a younger generation " finding film funding is germany is almost impossible unless you want to make commercial films , " said andreas feller , a berlin-based film director , " and making commercial movies is not why most of us got into this business . " a trained director , feller recently launched the web site filmemacher.org , an internet platform to help young filmmakers throughout germany come together and pool their resources . because german film producers are so fixated on commercial success , feller believes that many great films that break traditional molds , like the oscar-winning " the lives of others , " never even get a chance to get made . " the german film establishment needs to be more flexible in its support of more ' underground ' films , " said feller . california dreaming ? no one can be sure whether or not the restraints of the german film industry or the scent of fame lured von donnersmarck to hollywood , but schmidt-hug for one is optimistic of his chances for success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director oliver hirschbiegel followed his hollywood dreams " von donnersmarck is a globetrotter who has grown up all over the world .

but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation . " now companies have to look beyond wages and compete with each other for good workers , " rode said . it 's important for european countries to continue investing there , as a strong polish economy is good for all of europe , he added . thomas rautenberg -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu members step up drive to join euro zone leading new european union member states have stepped up efforts to reach the next critical stage of european integration - adopting the euro .

" for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of the recent riots in copenhagen called on the ' trouble makers of the world ' europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .

but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .

boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .

florian henkel von donnersmarck 's film " the lives of others " has swept more than 32 german and international awards including the coveted oscar for best foreign-language film . but once a german filmmaker wins serious accolades , the next question is usually : " so when are you moving to hollywood ? " according to a recent article in the german edition of the magazine vanity fair , von donnersmarck already has made the jump across the pond and is now calling a suite at the beverly wilshire hotel in los angeles home . he will be joining turkish-german director mennan yapo , whose hollywood debut " premonition , " starring sandra bullock , has raked in over $ 17 million -lrb- 13 million euros -rrb- in box office receipts since its us release just two weeks ago . this exodus of german directors may seem like the next logical step towards a successful career in an increasingly global film industry , but some directors argue that the hurdles directors face in their home country is what really entices many of them to seek their fortunes elsewhere . filmmaking german style " for directors in germany it is very hard to make a living in film and many are forced to do other jobs like commercials to survive , " said steffen schmidt-hug , director of the german film directors association , a group that works to promote and improve working conditions for directors .
" others look for work in other countries like france and america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's berlin 's golden bear versus hollywood 's golden man under the rules governing the germany film industry , directors are classified as technicians - like set designers and gaffers - and fall under strict limits regarding the amount a director can earn on each project , even if the film is a large commercial success . schmidt-hug claims these rules frustrate many filmmakers by also limiting a director 's artistic freedom by always granting a film 's final cut to the producer . " in france by law the director gets the final cut .
in america the director gets the director 's cut but not the final cut , " said schmidt-hug . " in germany the directors do not even have a directors cut . " oliver hirschbiegel , director of the critically-acclaimed film " the downfall , " has repeatedly lambasted the german film industry and famously said during a panel discussion last year that directors in germany are " paid like shit . "
he promptly packed his bags for hollywood . new money , old problems as in most european countries , the german film industry is built upon public financing .
the federal government allocates over 260 million euros for film projects each year . this includes an additional 60 million euros earmarked in the 2007 federal budget which is mean to act as an " incentive to boost film production in germany . " " the model will have a swift and direct impact on german producers and studios , " said bernd neumann , federal government commissioner for culture and media , in support of the new incentives , " and will make germany a more attractive production location for major international productions as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could charlie chaplin have gotten film funding in germany ?
but according to schmidt-hug , this system is structured in favor of established producers by setting strict criteria like requiring independent filmmakers to sign a distribution deal before allocating any funds , a difficult task for even the most experienced director . such a system puts enormous hurdles in the way of up-and-coming and inexperienced filmmakers , like von donnersmarck , for example . " in germany we have the concept of the ' struggling poet ' , " said schmidt-hug , " and people say that the artist does not need to be paid .
they get their film , their art . " a younger generation " finding film funding is germany is almost impossible unless you want to make commercial films , " said andreas feller , a berlin-based film director , " and making commercial movies is not why most of us got into this business . " a trained director , feller recently launched the web site filmemacher.org , an internet platform to help young filmmakers throughout germany come together and pool their resources . because german film producers are so fixated on commercial success , feller believes that many great films that break traditional molds , like the oscar-winning " the lives of others , " never even get a chance to get made . " the german film establishment needs to be more flexible in its support of more ' underground ' films , " said feller . california dreaming ? no one can be sure whether or not the restraints of the german film industry or the scent of fame lured von donnersmarck to hollywood , but schmidt-hug for one is optimistic of his chances for success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director oliver hirschbiegel followed his hollywood dreams " von donnersmarck is a globetrotter who has grown up all over the world .
he is a brilliant director who will be very successful in the american system , " he said . but not every german director is looking for his day in the sun .
last year , director wolfgang becker -lrb- " goodbye lenin " -rrb- was asked if he would ever trade making films in germany for the sunny skies of southern california . likely referring to the low cost of living in the german capital , where a little money goes a long way , he had a quick answer .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book .

" tough game " bremen , who also played out a scoreless draw last weekend against energie cottbus and in the uefa cup against az alkmaar on thursday , once again struggled to find the net against nuremberg . in a turgid first half , the closest thomas schaaf 's side came to a scoring opportunity occurred after 26 minutes when an off-balance aaron hunt found himself in space in the area but failed to hit the target . hugo almeda twice went close for bremen in the early stages of the second half before rosenberg bundled home the winner with 15 minutes remaining having come on just five minutes earlier . " it was a tough game just as we expected , " said werder coach thomas schaaf after the match . leverkusen 's own goal leverkusen conceded three goals for the second game in succession as bochum boosted their chances of avoiding the drop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's theofanis gekas scored two goals against leverkusen the home side , who lost 3-0 to osasuna in a uefa cup quarter-final tie thursday , went behind through a karim haggui own goal after eight minutes and found themselves two down after 16 minutes when a totally unmarked anthar yahia headed home at the far post . haggui 's miserable day continued on 22 minutes when a woefully underhit backpass was intercepted by theofanis gekas , who rounded leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler to make it 3-0 .
not surprisingly , haggui was hauled off shortly afterwards and replaced by andrey voronin . stefan kiessling pulled one back for leverkusen shortly after the hour mark to make it 3-1 but later saw red for making a comment to referee peter gagelmann .

" tough game " bremen , who also played out a scoreless draw last weekend against energie cottbus and in the uefa cup against az alkmaar on thursday , once again struggled to find the net against nuremberg . in a turgid first half , the closest thomas schaaf 's side came to a scoring opportunity occurred after 26 minutes when an off-balance aaron hunt found himself in space in the area but failed to hit the target . hugo almeda twice went close for bremen in the early stages of the second half before rosenberg bundled home the winner with 15 minutes remaining having come on just five minutes earlier . " it was a tough game just as we expected , " said werder coach thomas schaaf after the match . leverkusen 's own goal leverkusen conceded three goals for the second game in succession as bochum boosted their chances of avoiding the drop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's theofanis gekas scored two goals against leverkusen the home side , who lost 3-0 to osasuna in a uefa cup quarter-final tie thursday , went behind through a karim haggui own goal after eight minutes and found themselves two down after 16 minutes when a totally unmarked anthar yahia headed home at the far post . haggui 's miserable day continued on 22 minutes when a woefully underhit backpass was intercepted by theofanis gekas , who rounded leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler to make it 3-0 .
not surprisingly , haggui was hauled off shortly afterwards and replaced by andrey voronin . stefan kiessling pulled one back for leverkusen shortly after the hour mark to make it 3-1 but later saw red for making a comment to referee peter gagelmann .
gekas complete the 4-1 rout for bochum with a breakaway effort two minutes from time .
on saturday , borussia dortmund eased their relegation worries with a 4-1 victory at alemmania aachen while vfl wolfsburg enjoyed a 3-2 victory over mainz 05 . cottbus moved toward the safety of mid-table with a 3-1 win at eintracht frankfurt while hertha berlin came from behind to secure a 1-1 draw at home to arminia bielefeld . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke hope to capitalize on rivals ' european hangovers bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book . " france is choosing a successor to 74-year-old jacques chirac , the veteran leader who has been in office since 1995 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de twelve candidates to run for french presidency over 40 potential candidates to fight next month 's french presidential elections have been whittled down to 12 , the country 's constitutional council announced , but there are no shocks in the shortlist .

while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election .

recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book . " france is choosing a successor to 74-year-old jacques chirac , the veteran leader who has been in office since 1995 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de twelve candidates to run for french presidency over 40 potential candidates to fight next month 's french presidential elections have been whittled down to 12 , the country 's constitutional council announced , but there are no shocks in the shortlist .
-lrb- 20.03.2007 -rrb- president chirac bows out of french politics president jacques chirac has announced that he will not stand as a candidate in the looming presidential election , ending a career of more than 40 years at the top of french politics .
-lrb- 12.03.2007 -rrb- extremist le pen strikes chord in france , again for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book .

" at midnight the operational squadron with the six recce tornados and their additional personnel deployed here were placed under nato command , " spokesman hartmut beilmann told deutsche presse-agentur on monday . two of the aircraft had undertaken a 90-minute acclimatization flight on monday , beilmann said , speaking from camp marmal near mazar-e sharif in northern afghanistan , where the squadron is based . " the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .
the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .
a recent survey showed 74 percent feared it could trigger terrorist attacks in germany . most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country . nato-led forces recently launched an offensive against the taliban , which claims to have thousands of suicide bombers across afghanistan . peace marches at home meanwhile , peace activists held traditional peace marches throughout germany over the easter weekend , but the numbers attending were well down from the movement 's heyday some 25 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 people took part in the 2007 frankfurt easter march the marchers called for an end to the deployment of german troops abroad , including the reconstruction mission in northern afghanistan and , in particular , the deployment of the tornados . the organizers of the marches said tens of thousands had participated in events in around 80 towns and cities across the country throughout the easter weekend . the main rallies on monday were held in frankfurt and hamburg , where up to 2,000 gathered in each city . the largest rally of the weekend occurred on sunday at fretzdorf , north of berlin , where police put the total at 3,000 , while organizers said 10,000 had taken part . the movement opposes plans by the defense ministry to reopen an military exercise zone there for low-flying jets that was used by soviet forces during the communist era . political support prominent members of the local social democrats took part in the fretzdorf rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth , left , of the green party has distanced herself from the peace marches leaders of germany 's green party , traditionally strong supporters of the marches , had distanced themselves from the organizers , accusing them of focusing exclusively on anti-militarism . greens chairwoman claudia roth referred to a " monochrome viewpoint " and " blanket rejection of the military , " and many prominent greens stayed away . germany 's easter marches gained their inspiration from britain 's campaign for nuclear disarmament of the 1950s .
in 1968 , when protest against the vietnam war was at its height , an estimated 300,000 marched . the all-time high was reached in 1983 , when 700,000 marched through west german cities in protest at the stationing of medium- range nuclear weapons in europe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

" tough game " bremen , who also played out a scoreless draw last weekend against energie cottbus and in the uefa cup against az alkmaar on thursday , once again struggled to find the net against nuremberg . in a turgid first half , the closest thomas schaaf 's side came to a scoring opportunity occurred after 26 minutes when an off-balance aaron hunt found himself in space in the area but failed to hit the target . hugo almeda twice went close for bremen in the early stages of the second half before rosenberg bundled home the winner with 15 minutes remaining having come on just five minutes earlier . " it was a tough game just as we expected , " said werder coach thomas schaaf after the match . leverkusen 's own goal leverkusen conceded three goals for the second game in succession as bochum boosted their chances of avoiding the drop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's theofanis gekas scored two goals against leverkusen the home side , who lost 3-0 to osasuna in a uefa cup quarter-final tie thursday , went behind through a karim haggui own goal after eight minutes and found themselves two down after 16 minutes when a totally unmarked anthar yahia headed home at the far post . haggui 's miserable day continued on 22 minutes when a woefully underhit backpass was intercepted by theofanis gekas , who rounded leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler to make it 3-0 .
not surprisingly , haggui was hauled off shortly afterwards and replaced by andrey voronin . stefan kiessling pulled one back for leverkusen shortly after the hour mark to make it 3-1 but later saw red for making a comment to referee peter gagelmann .
gekas complete the 4-1 rout for bochum with a breakaway effort two minutes from time .

fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination .

the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .

" tough game " bremen , who also played out a scoreless draw last weekend against energie cottbus and in the uefa cup against az alkmaar on thursday , once again struggled to find the net against nuremberg . in a turgid first half , the closest thomas schaaf 's side came to a scoring opportunity occurred after 26 minutes when an off-balance aaron hunt found himself in space in the area but failed to hit the target . hugo almeda twice went close for bremen in the early stages of the second half before rosenberg bundled home the winner with 15 minutes remaining having come on just five minutes earlier . " it was a tough game just as we expected , " said werder coach thomas schaaf after the match . leverkusen 's own goal leverkusen conceded three goals for the second game in succession as bochum boosted their chances of avoiding the drop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's theofanis gekas scored two goals against leverkusen the home side , who lost 3-0 to osasuna in a uefa cup quarter-final tie thursday , went behind through a karim haggui own goal after eight minutes and found themselves two down after 16 minutes when a totally unmarked anthar yahia headed home at the far post . haggui 's miserable day continued on 22 minutes when a woefully underhit backpass was intercepted by theofanis gekas , who rounded leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler to make it 3-0 .
not surprisingly , haggui was hauled off shortly afterwards and replaced by andrey voronin . stefan kiessling pulled one back for leverkusen shortly after the hour mark to make it 3-1 but later saw red for making a comment to referee peter gagelmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of the recent riots in copenhagen called on the ' trouble makers of the world ' europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .
while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.04.2007 outsourcing hotspot cools as wages rise in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western european companies have outsourced jobs to poland in recent years a few years ago , poland was a favorite destination for european manufacturers looking to cut costs .
but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation . " now companies have to look beyond wages and compete with each other for good workers , " rode said . it 's important for european countries to continue investing there , as a strong polish economy is good for all of europe , he added . thomas rautenberg -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu members step up drive to join euro zone leading new european union member states have stepped up efforts to reach the next critical stage of european integration - adopting the euro .

but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations .

boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .

" the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .

" tough game " bremen , who also played out a scoreless draw last weekend against energie cottbus and in the uefa cup against az alkmaar on thursday , once again struggled to find the net against nuremberg . in a turgid first half , the closest thomas schaaf 's side came to a scoring opportunity occurred after 26 minutes when an off-balance aaron hunt found himself in space in the area but failed to hit the target . hugo almeda twice went close for bremen in the early stages of the second half before rosenberg bundled home the winner with 15 minutes remaining having come on just five minutes earlier . " it was a tough game just as we expected , " said werder coach thomas schaaf after the match . leverkusen 's own goal leverkusen conceded three goals for the second game in succession as bochum boosted their chances of avoiding the drop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's theofanis gekas scored two goals against leverkusen the home side , who lost 3-0 to osasuna in a uefa cup quarter-final tie thursday , went behind through a karim haggui own goal after eight minutes and found themselves two down after 16 minutes when a totally unmarked anthar yahia headed home at the far post . haggui 's miserable day continued on 22 minutes when a woefully underhit backpass was intercepted by theofanis gekas , who rounded leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler to make it 3-0 .
not surprisingly , haggui was hauled off shortly afterwards and replaced by andrey voronin . stefan kiessling pulled one back for leverkusen shortly after the hour mark to make it 3-1 but later saw red for making a comment to referee peter gagelmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of the recent riots in copenhagen called on the ' trouble makers of the world ' europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .
while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within back to first page back 2/2 violent anarchist groups infiltrating protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anarchists attach themselves to left-wing causes in addition to the improved coordination of groups and the attendances at demonstrations , violence has been another aspect of recent protests which has been on the rise . the may day protests in germany rarely pass without a car or two being set on fire , but it is almost out of tradition that the police allow a few vehicles to be sacrificed to appease the anarchists and avoid confrontation . at other more international demonstrations , however , violent confrontation has increased in both regularity and intensity .
while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of the recent riots in copenhagen called on the ' trouble makers of the world ' europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .
while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .

while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book . " france is choosing a successor to 74-year-old jacques chirac , the veteran leader who has been in office since 1995 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de twelve candidates to run for french presidency over 40 potential candidates to fight next month 's french presidential elections have been whittled down to 12 , the country 's constitutional council announced , but there are no shocks in the shortlist .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

" the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .
the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .

while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.04.2007 outsourcing hotspot cools as wages rise in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western european companies have outsourced jobs to poland in recent years a few years ago , poland was a favorite destination for european manufacturers looking to cut costs .
but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation . " now companies have to look beyond wages and compete with each other for good workers , " rode said . it 's important for european countries to continue investing there , as a strong polish economy is good for all of europe , he added . thomas rautenberg -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu members step up drive to join euro zone leading new european union member states have stepped up efforts to reach the next critical stage of european integration - adopting the euro .

" at midnight the operational squadron with the six recce tornados and their additional personnel deployed here were placed under nato command , " spokesman hartmut beilmann told deutsche presse-agentur on monday . two of the aircraft had undertaken a 90-minute acclimatization flight on monday , beilmann said , speaking from camp marmal near mazar-e sharif in northern afghanistan , where the squadron is based . " the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .

but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation . " now companies have to look beyond wages and compete with each other for good workers , " rode said . it 's important for european countries to continue investing there , as a strong polish economy is good for all of europe , he added . thomas rautenberg -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu members step up drive to join euro zone leading new european union member states have stepped up efforts to reach the next critical stage of european integration - adopting the euro .

" at midnight the operational squadron with the six recce tornados and their additional personnel deployed here were placed under nato command , " spokesman hartmut beilmann told deutsche presse-agentur on monday . two of the aircraft had undertaken a 90-minute acclimatization flight on monday , beilmann said , speaking from camp marmal near mazar-e sharif in northern afghanistan , where the squadron is based . " the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .
the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .
a recent survey showed 74 percent feared it could trigger terrorist attacks in germany . most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country . nato-led forces recently launched an offensive against the taliban , which claims to have thousands of suicide bombers across afghanistan . peace marches at home meanwhile , peace activists held traditional peace marches throughout germany over the easter weekend , but the numbers attending were well down from the movement 's heyday some 25 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 people took part in the 2007 frankfurt easter march the marchers called for an end to the deployment of german troops abroad , including the reconstruction mission in northern afghanistan and , in particular , the deployment of the tornados . the organizers of the marches said tens of thousands had participated in events in around 80 towns and cities across the country throughout the easter weekend . the main rallies on monday were held in frankfurt and hamburg , where up to 2,000 gathered in each city . the largest rally of the weekend occurred on sunday at fretzdorf , north of berlin , where police put the total at 3,000 , while organizers said 10,000 had taken part . the movement opposes plans by the defense ministry to reopen an military exercise zone there for low-flying jets that was used by soviet forces during the communist era . political support prominent members of the local social democrats took part in the fretzdorf rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth , left , of the green party has distanced herself from the peace marches leaders of germany 's green party , traditionally strong supporters of the marches , had distanced themselves from the organizers , accusing them of focusing exclusively on anti-militarism . greens chairwoman claudia roth referred to a " monochrome viewpoint " and " blanket rejection of the military , " and many prominent greens stayed away . germany 's easter marches gained their inspiration from britain 's campaign for nuclear disarmament of the 1950s .
in 1968 , when protest against the vietnam war was at its height , an estimated 300,000 marched . the all-time high was reached in 1983 , when 700,000 marched through west german cities in protest at the stationing of medium- range nuclear weapons in europe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within back to first page back 2/2 violent anarchist groups infiltrating protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anarchists attach themselves to left-wing causes in addition to the improved coordination of groups and the attendances at demonstrations , violence has been another aspect of recent protests which has been on the rise . the may day protests in germany rarely pass without a car or two being set on fire , but it is almost out of tradition that the police allow a few vehicles to be sacrificed to appease the anarchists and avoid confrontation . at other more international demonstrations , however , violent confrontation has increased in both regularity and intensity .
while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of the recent riots in copenhagen called on the ' trouble makers of the world ' europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .
while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .

in 1968 , when protest against the vietnam war was at its height , an estimated 300,000 marched . the all-time high was reached in 1983 , when 700,000 marched through west german cities in protest at the stationing of medium- range nuclear weapons in europe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de left-wing extremism -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within back to first page back 2/2 violent anarchist groups infiltrating protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anarchists attach themselves to left-wing causes in addition to the improved coordination of groups and the attendances at demonstrations , violence has been another aspect of recent protests which has been on the rise . the may day protests in germany rarely pass without a car or two being set on fire , but it is almost out of tradition that the police allow a few vehicles to be sacrificed to appease the anarchists and avoid confrontation . at other more international demonstrations , however , violent confrontation has increased in both regularity and intensity .
while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

" these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .

" tough game " bremen , who also played out a scoreless draw last weekend against energie cottbus and in the uefa cup against az alkmaar on thursday , once again struggled to find the net against nuremberg . in a turgid first half , the closest thomas schaaf 's side came to a scoring opportunity occurred after 26 minutes when an off-balance aaron hunt found himself in space in the area but failed to hit the target . hugo almeda twice went close for bremen in the early stages of the second half before rosenberg bundled home the winner with 15 minutes remaining having come on just five minutes earlier . " it was a tough game just as we expected , " said werder coach thomas schaaf after the match . leverkusen 's own goal leverkusen conceded three goals for the second game in succession as bochum boosted their chances of avoiding the drop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's theofanis gekas scored two goals against leverkusen the home side , who lost 3-0 to osasuna in a uefa cup quarter-final tie thursday , went behind through a karim haggui own goal after eight minutes and found themselves two down after 16 minutes when a totally unmarked anthar yahia headed home at the far post . haggui 's miserable day continued on 22 minutes when a woefully underhit backpass was intercepted by theofanis gekas , who rounded leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler to make it 3-0 .
not surprisingly , haggui was hauled off shortly afterwards and replaced by andrey voronin . stefan kiessling pulled one back for leverkusen shortly after the hour mark to make it 3-1 but later saw red for making a comment to referee peter gagelmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election .

recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination .

" the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .

florian henkel von donnersmarck 's film " the lives of others " has swept more than 32 german and international awards including the coveted oscar for best foreign-language film . but once a german filmmaker wins serious accolades , the next question is usually : " so when are you moving to hollywood ? " according to a recent article in the german edition of the magazine vanity fair , von donnersmarck already has made the jump across the pond and is now calling a suite at the beverly wilshire hotel in los angeles home . he will be joining turkish-german director mennan yapo , whose hollywood debut " premonition , " starring sandra bullock , has raked in over $ 17 million -lrb- 13 million euros -rrb- in box office receipts since its us release just two weeks ago . this exodus of german directors may seem like the next logical step towards a successful career in an increasingly global film industry , but some directors argue that the hurdles directors face in their home country is what really entices many of them to seek their fortunes elsewhere . filmmaking german style " for directors in germany it is very hard to make a living in film and many are forced to do other jobs like commercials to survive , " said steffen schmidt-hug , director of the german film directors association , a group that works to promote and improve working conditions for directors .
" others look for work in other countries like france and america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's berlin 's golden bear versus hollywood 's golden man under the rules governing the germany film industry , directors are classified as technicians - like set designers and gaffers - and fall under strict limits regarding the amount a director can earn on each project , even if the film is a large commercial success . schmidt-hug claims these rules frustrate many filmmakers by also limiting a director 's artistic freedom by always granting a film 's final cut to the producer . " in france by law the director gets the final cut .
in america the director gets the director 's cut but not the final cut , " said schmidt-hug . " in germany the directors do not even have a directors cut . " oliver hirschbiegel , director of the critically-acclaimed film " the downfall , " has repeatedly lambasted the german film industry and famously said during a panel discussion last year that directors in germany are " paid like shit . "
he promptly packed his bags for hollywood . new money , old problems as in most european countries , the german film industry is built upon public financing .
the federal government allocates over 260 million euros for film projects each year . this includes an additional 60 million euros earmarked in the 2007 federal budget which is mean to act as an " incentive to boost film production in germany . " " the model will have a swift and direct impact on german producers and studios , " said bernd neumann , federal government commissioner for culture and media , in support of the new incentives , " and will make germany a more attractive production location for major international productions as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could charlie chaplin have gotten film funding in germany ?
but according to schmidt-hug , this system is structured in favor of established producers by setting strict criteria like requiring independent filmmakers to sign a distribution deal before allocating any funds , a difficult task for even the most experienced director . such a system puts enormous hurdles in the way of up-and-coming and inexperienced filmmakers , like von donnersmarck , for example . " in germany we have the concept of the ' struggling poet ' , " said schmidt-hug , " and people say that the artist does not need to be paid .
they get their film , their art . " a younger generation " finding film funding is germany is almost impossible unless you want to make commercial films , " said andreas feller , a berlin-based film director , " and making commercial movies is not why most of us got into this business . " a trained director , feller recently launched the web site filmemacher.org , an internet platform to help young filmmakers throughout germany come together and pool their resources . because german film producers are so fixated on commercial success , feller believes that many great films that break traditional molds , like the oscar-winning " the lives of others , " never even get a chance to get made . " the german film establishment needs to be more flexible in its support of more ' underground ' films , " said feller . california dreaming ? no one can be sure whether or not the restraints of the german film industry or the scent of fame lured von donnersmarck to hollywood , but schmidt-hug for one is optimistic of his chances for success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director oliver hirschbiegel followed his hollywood dreams " von donnersmarck is a globetrotter who has grown up all over the world .
he is a brilliant director who will be very successful in the american system , " he said . but not every german director is looking for his day in the sun .
last year , director wolfgang becker -lrb- " goodbye lenin " -rrb- was asked if he would ever trade making films in germany for the sunny skies of southern california . likely referring to the low cost of living in the german capital , where a little money goes a long way , he had a quick answer .

florian henkel von donnersmarck 's film " the lives of others " has swept more than 32 german and international awards including the coveted oscar for best foreign-language film . but once a german filmmaker wins serious accolades , the next question is usually : " so when are you moving to hollywood ? " according to a recent article in the german edition of the magazine vanity fair , von donnersmarck already has made the jump across the pond and is now calling a suite at the beverly wilshire hotel in los angeles home . he will be joining turkish-german director mennan yapo , whose hollywood debut " premonition , " starring sandra bullock , has raked in over $ 17 million -lrb- 13 million euros -rrb- in box office receipts since its us release just two weeks ago . this exodus of german directors may seem like the next logical step towards a successful career in an increasingly global film industry , but some directors argue that the hurdles directors face in their home country is what really entices many of them to seek their fortunes elsewhere . filmmaking german style " for directors in germany it is very hard to make a living in film and many are forced to do other jobs like commercials to survive , " said steffen schmidt-hug , director of the german film directors association , a group that works to promote and improve working conditions for directors .
" others look for work in other countries like france and america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's berlin 's golden bear versus hollywood 's golden man under the rules governing the germany film industry , directors are classified as technicians - like set designers and gaffers - and fall under strict limits regarding the amount a director can earn on each project , even if the film is a large commercial success . schmidt-hug claims these rules frustrate many filmmakers by also limiting a director 's artistic freedom by always granting a film 's final cut to the producer . " in france by law the director gets the final cut .
in america the director gets the director 's cut but not the final cut , " said schmidt-hug . " in germany the directors do not even have a directors cut . " oliver hirschbiegel , director of the critically-acclaimed film " the downfall , " has repeatedly lambasted the german film industry and famously said during a panel discussion last year that directors in germany are " paid like shit . "
he promptly packed his bags for hollywood . new money , old problems as in most european countries , the german film industry is built upon public financing .
the federal government allocates over 260 million euros for film projects each year . this includes an additional 60 million euros earmarked in the 2007 federal budget which is mean to act as an " incentive to boost film production in germany . " " the model will have a swift and direct impact on german producers and studios , " said bernd neumann , federal government commissioner for culture and media , in support of the new incentives , " and will make germany a more attractive production location for major international productions as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could charlie chaplin have gotten film funding in germany ?
but according to schmidt-hug , this system is structured in favor of established producers by setting strict criteria like requiring independent filmmakers to sign a distribution deal before allocating any funds , a difficult task for even the most experienced director . such a system puts enormous hurdles in the way of up-and-coming and inexperienced filmmakers , like von donnersmarck , for example . " in germany we have the concept of the ' struggling poet ' , " said schmidt-hug , " and people say that the artist does not need to be paid .
they get their film , their art . " a younger generation " finding film funding is germany is almost impossible unless you want to make commercial films , " said andreas feller , a berlin-based film director , " and making commercial movies is not why most of us got into this business . " a trained director , feller recently launched the web site filmemacher.org , an internet platform to help young filmmakers throughout germany come together and pool their resources . because german film producers are so fixated on commercial success , feller believes that many great films that break traditional molds , like the oscar-winning " the lives of others , " never even get a chance to get made .

but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation .

but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation . " now companies have to look beyond wages and compete with each other for good workers , " rode said . it 's important for european countries to continue investing there , as a strong polish economy is good for all of europe , he added . thomas rautenberg -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu members step up drive to join euro zone leading new european union member states have stepped up efforts to reach the next critical stage of european integration - adopting the euro .

while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .

the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

florian henkel von donnersmarck 's film " the lives of others " has swept more than 32 german and international awards including the coveted oscar for best foreign-language film . but once a german filmmaker wins serious accolades , the next question is usually : " so when are you moving to hollywood ? " according to a recent article in the german edition of the magazine vanity fair , von donnersmarck already has made the jump across the pond and is now calling a suite at the beverly wilshire hotel in los angeles home . he will be joining turkish-german director mennan yapo , whose hollywood debut " premonition , " starring sandra bullock , has raked in over $ 17 million -lrb- 13 million euros -rrb- in box office receipts since its us release just two weeks ago . this exodus of german directors may seem like the next logical step towards a successful career in an increasingly global film industry , but some directors argue that the hurdles directors face in their home country is what really entices many of them to seek their fortunes elsewhere . filmmaking german style " for directors in germany it is very hard to make a living in film and many are forced to do other jobs like commercials to survive , " said steffen schmidt-hug , director of the german film directors association , a group that works to promote and improve working conditions for directors .
" others look for work in other countries like france and america . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's berlin 's golden bear versus hollywood 's golden man under the rules governing the germany film industry , directors are classified as technicians - like set designers and gaffers - and fall under strict limits regarding the amount a director can earn on each project , even if the film is a large commercial success . schmidt-hug claims these rules frustrate many filmmakers by also limiting a director 's artistic freedom by always granting a film 's final cut to the producer . " in france by law the director gets the final cut .
in america the director gets the director 's cut but not the final cut , " said schmidt-hug . " in germany the directors do not even have a directors cut . " oliver hirschbiegel , director of the critically-acclaimed film " the downfall , " has repeatedly lambasted the german film industry and famously said during a panel discussion last year that directors in germany are " paid like shit . "
he promptly packed his bags for hollywood . new money , old problems as in most european countries , the german film industry is built upon public financing .
the federal government allocates over 260 million euros for film projects each year . this includes an additional 60 million euros earmarked in the 2007 federal budget which is mean to act as an " incentive to boost film production in germany . " " the model will have a swift and direct impact on german producers and studios , " said bernd neumann , federal government commissioner for culture and media , in support of the new incentives , " and will make germany a more attractive production location for major international productions as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could charlie chaplin have gotten film funding in germany ?
but according to schmidt-hug , this system is structured in favor of established producers by setting strict criteria like requiring independent filmmakers to sign a distribution deal before allocating any funds , a difficult task for even the most experienced director . such a system puts enormous hurdles in the way of up-and-coming and inexperienced filmmakers , like von donnersmarck , for example . " in germany we have the concept of the ' struggling poet ' , " said schmidt-hug , " and people say that the artist does not need to be paid .
they get their film , their art . " a younger generation " finding film funding is germany is almost impossible unless you want to make commercial films , " said andreas feller , a berlin-based film director , " and making commercial movies is not why most of us got into this business . " a trained director , feller recently launched the web site filmemacher.org , an internet platform to help young filmmakers throughout germany come together and pool their resources . because german film producers are so fixated on commercial success , feller believes that many great films that break traditional molds , like the oscar-winning " the lives of others , " never even get a chance to get made . " the german film establishment needs to be more flexible in its support of more ' underground ' films , " said feller . california dreaming ? no one can be sure whether or not the restraints of the german film industry or the scent of fame lured von donnersmarck to hollywood , but schmidt-hug for one is optimistic of his chances for success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director oliver hirschbiegel followed his hollywood dreams " von donnersmarck is a globetrotter who has grown up all over the world .
he is a brilliant director who will be very successful in the american system , " he said . but not every german director is looking for his day in the sun .
last year , director wolfgang becker -lrb- " goodbye lenin " -rrb- was asked if he would ever trade making films in germany for the sunny skies of southern california . likely referring to the low cost of living in the german capital , where a little money goes a long way , he had a quick answer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de left-wing extremism -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within back to first page back 2/2 violent anarchist groups infiltrating protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anarchists attach themselves to left-wing causes in addition to the improved coordination of groups and the attendances at demonstrations , violence has been another aspect of recent protests which has been on the rise . the may day protests in germany rarely pass without a car or two being set on fire , but it is almost out of tradition that the police allow a few vehicles to be sacrificed to appease the anarchists and avoid confrontation . at other more international demonstrations , however , violent confrontation has increased in both regularity and intensity .
while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book .

but with wages rising and a shortage of skilled workers , it might not remain the outsourcing hotspot for long . a few years ago , swedish appliances manufacturer electrolux closed its plant in the southern german city of nüremberg and began producing dishwashers in poland . carmaker opel , too , decided to build its " zafira " in the polish town of gliwice . it 's a trend that seemed inevitable when poland joined the european union in 2004 .
with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation . " now companies have to look beyond wages and compete with each other for good workers , " rode said . it 's important for european countries to continue investing there , as a strong polish economy is good for all of europe , he added . thomas rautenberg -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu members step up drive to join euro zone leading new european union member states have stepped up efforts to reach the next critical stage of european integration - adopting the euro .

" tough game " bremen , who also played out a scoreless draw last weekend against energie cottbus and in the uefa cup against az alkmaar on thursday , once again struggled to find the net against nuremberg . in a turgid first half , the closest thomas schaaf 's side came to a scoring opportunity occurred after 26 minutes when an off-balance aaron hunt found himself in space in the area but failed to hit the target . hugo almeda twice went close for bremen in the early stages of the second half before rosenberg bundled home the winner with 15 minutes remaining having come on just five minutes earlier . " it was a tough game just as we expected , " said werder coach thomas schaaf after the match . leverkusen 's own goal leverkusen conceded three goals for the second game in succession as bochum boosted their chances of avoiding the drop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's theofanis gekas scored two goals against leverkusen the home side , who lost 3-0 to osasuna in a uefa cup quarter-final tie thursday , went behind through a karim haggui own goal after eight minutes and found themselves two down after 16 minutes when a totally unmarked anthar yahia headed home at the far post . haggui 's miserable day continued on 22 minutes when a woefully underhit backpass was intercepted by theofanis gekas , who rounded leverkusen goalkeeper rene adler to make it 3-0 .
not surprisingly , haggui was hauled off shortly afterwards and replaced by andrey voronin . stefan kiessling pulled one back for leverkusen shortly after the hour mark to make it 3-1 but later saw red for making a comment to referee peter gagelmann .
gekas complete the 4-1 rout for bochum with a breakaway effort two minutes from time .

with its low labor costs and huge pool of workers , german workers feared their eastern european neighbor would pry away their jobs by becoming the destination of choice for companies looking to stay competitive in an ever globalizing world . it did n't turn out exactly that way .
while poland was once a prime low-wage destination , that is changing .
a shortage of skilled workers has led to wage increases that make poland less of a bargain for outsourcing than it once was . heading further east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in high demand electrolux invested 40 million euros -lrb- $ 53.5 million -rrb- in the polish town of olawa before closing the plant in nürenberg .
the move to poland meant that many employees of the aeg subsidiary in germany lost their jobs . kazimierz kimso , regional head of the polish solidarnosc labor union , says that little can be done to stop jobs from moving to cheaper locations . " naturally , we have solidarity with our foreign colleagues who have lost their jobs .
but we also are happy when new jobs come , since unemployment is very high , " kimso said .
but , he added , things could just as well change quickly for poland . " we are by all means aware that the production today is moved from germany or other old eu countries to poland , " he said .
" but tomorrow this can continue on in the direction of ukraine .
that 's naturally a development that we are n't pleased about . " in addition to its low-cost value , poland also offers other charms for international investors . in 1996 , the polish government turned the olawa area into a special economic zone .
investors who wanted to relocate there , were offered lower tax rates .
even with poland joining the european union , this tax break will remain until 2017 . the hunt for skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel assembles some of its cars in poland despite the obvious advantages of doing business in poland , international companies are gradually discovering a downside , too . when electrolux first moved to the country , the swedish company had problems finding qualified workers .
boleslaw januszkiewicz , who heads up a large boat motor plant , has also found it difficult to find employees with the skills he needed . " at our company , for the boat motor plant , we have between 11 and 150 open positions each month .
that 's for normally very skilled welders , fitters and controllers .
our wages have increased sharply .
the only people who do n't earn very much are the new employees who are doing their first apprenticeships , " januszkiewicz said . although poland has cheaper labor costs than germany , that 's no longer a primary reason for companies to relocate to poland , said economics expert clemens rode at the polish office of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation . " now companies have to look beyond wages and compete with each other for good workers , " rode said . it 's important for european countries to continue investing there , as a strong polish economy is good for all of europe , he added . thomas rautenberg -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu members step up drive to join euro zone leading new european union member states have stepped up efforts to reach the next critical stage of european integration - adopting the euro .

" the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .
the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .

in 1968 , when protest against the vietnam war was at its height , an estimated 300,000 marched . the all-time high was reached in 1983 , when 700,000 marched through west german cities in protest at the stationing of medium- range nuclear weapons in europe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book .

while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .

the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within back to first page back 2/2 violent anarchist groups infiltrating protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anarchists attach themselves to left-wing causes in addition to the improved coordination of groups and the attendances at demonstrations , violence has been another aspect of recent protests which has been on the rise . the may day protests in germany rarely pass without a car or two being set on fire , but it is almost out of tradition that the police allow a few vehicles to be sacrificed to appease the anarchists and avoid confrontation . at other more international demonstrations , however , violent confrontation has increased in both regularity and intensity .
while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 french presidential campaign kicks off - officially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidates can now officially put up their election posters the official campaign period for the french presidential election has opened , with millions of voters unsure which candidate they want as a successor to outgoing president jacque chirac . nicolas sarkozy of the center-right ump party and socialist rival segolene royal are still leading the polls , with centrist francois bayrou in third place .
recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book . " france is choosing a successor to 74-year-old jacques chirac , the veteran leader who has been in office since 1995 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de twelve candidates to run for french presidency over 40 potential candidates to fight next month 's french presidential elections have been whittled down to 12 , the country 's constitutional council announced , but there are no shocks in the shortlist .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination .

" traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic .

recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .

each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election .

while the coordination of protests has improved , the radical left continues to suffer from a violent minority . the easter holiday weekend is one of the traditional protest seasons on the european activist calendar , one which has enjoyed a renaissance in the last few years .
after watching attendance figures fall throughout the 1990s , the 2003 invasion of iraq marked the beginning of a gradual upswing . the increase of people at the easter demonstrations over the past four years , and the rise in other high-profile , hugely popular protests suggests that european activists , mainly from the radical left , have more to march against these days . opposition to the iraq war mobilized between six and 10 million people worldwide in 2003 - three million alone in rome , while over 300,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators converged on genoa in 2001 .
this summer 's g8 summit , from june 6 - 8 , is expected to attract a similar number in host location heiligendamm and the surrounding region . it seems that the left-wing movement in europe has found a new impetus the like of which has not been seen since the radicalism of the 60s and 70s .
fired by opposition to war , globalization , inequality and threats to the environment , radical left-wing groups are once again making their presence known . umbrella organization mobilizes radical left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coordinated anti-war demos involved millions however , war , poverty and inequality are not new issues .
the gradual resurgence of the radical left in recent years has as much to do with its organization than an increase in causes to rally around .
the cohesion and professionalism involved in bringing a continent 's like-minded groups together in one place suggests the work of a coordinated radical left-wing network in europe . one organization that claims to play a leading role in mobilizing the radical left across europe is globalise resistance , a non-violent london-based group which has been involved in coordinating many of the continent ’ s largest demonstrations of the last six years . " for protests such as the eu and g8 summits , there is an umbrella organization that is established to coordinate such mobilizations , " globalise resistance 's guy taylor told dw-world.de.
" more often than not , it is globalise resistance that takes that role . " " the radical left has always been better integrated than the far-right as it has historically been supported by states such as the soviet union and china , " said professor cas mudde , a senior lecturer in political science at the university of antwerp and an expert on the radical left .
" while that state support is not there anymore , the left has a more international ideology and the links remain allowing independent organizations to work together .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination .

" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .

" at midnight the operational squadron with the six recce tornados and their additional personnel deployed here were placed under nato command , " spokesman hartmut beilmann told deutsche presse-agentur on monday . two of the aircraft had undertaken a 90-minute acclimatization flight on monday , beilmann said , speaking from camp marmal near mazar-e sharif in northern afghanistan , where the squadron is based . " the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .
the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .
a recent survey showed 74 percent feared it could trigger terrorist attacks in germany . most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country . nato-led forces recently launched an offensive against the taliban , which claims to have thousands of suicide bombers across afghanistan . peace marches at home meanwhile , peace activists held traditional peace marches throughout germany over the easter weekend , but the numbers attending were well down from the movement 's heyday some 25 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 people took part in the 2007 frankfurt easter march the marchers called for an end to the deployment of german troops abroad , including the reconstruction mission in northern afghanistan and , in particular , the deployment of the tornados . the organizers of the marches said tens of thousands had participated in events in around 80 towns and cities across the country throughout the easter weekend . the main rallies on monday were held in frankfurt and hamburg , where up to 2,000 gathered in each city . the largest rally of the weekend occurred on sunday at fretzdorf , north of berlin , where police put the total at 3,000 , while organizers said 10,000 had taken part . the movement opposes plans by the defense ministry to reopen an military exercise zone there for low-flying jets that was used by soviet forces during the communist era . political support prominent members of the local social democrats took part in the fretzdorf rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth , left , of the green party has distanced herself from the peace marches leaders of germany 's green party , traditionally strong supporters of the marches , had distanced themselves from the organizers , accusing them of focusing exclusively on anti-militarism . greens chairwoman claudia roth referred to a " monochrome viewpoint " and " blanket rejection of the military , " and many prominent greens stayed away . germany 's easter marches gained their inspiration from britain 's campaign for nuclear disarmament of the 1950s .
in 1968 , when protest against the vietnam war was at its height , an estimated 300,000 marched . the all-time high was reached in 1983 , when 700,000 marched through west german cities in protest at the stationing of medium- range nuclear weapons in europe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination .

however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .

" at midnight the operational squadron with the six recce tornados and their additional personnel deployed here were placed under nato command , " spokesman hartmut beilmann told deutsche presse-agentur on monday . two of the aircraft had undertaken a 90-minute acclimatization flight on monday , beilmann said , speaking from camp marmal near mazar-e sharif in northern afghanistan , where the squadron is based . " the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .
the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .
a recent survey showed 74 percent feared it could trigger terrorist attacks in germany . most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country . nato-led forces recently launched an offensive against the taliban , which claims to have thousands of suicide bombers across afghanistan . peace marches at home meanwhile , peace activists held traditional peace marches throughout germany over the easter weekend , but the numbers attending were well down from the movement 's heyday some 25 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 people took part in the 2007 frankfurt easter march the marchers called for an end to the deployment of german troops abroad , including the reconstruction mission in northern afghanistan and , in particular , the deployment of the tornados . the organizers of the marches said tens of thousands had participated in events in around 80 towns and cities across the country throughout the easter weekend . the main rallies on monday were held in frankfurt and hamburg , where up to 2,000 gathered in each city . the largest rally of the weekend occurred on sunday at fretzdorf , north of berlin , where police put the total at 3,000 , while organizers said 10,000 had taken part . the movement opposes plans by the defense ministry to reopen an military exercise zone there for low-flying jets that was used by soviet forces during the communist era . political support prominent members of the local social democrats took part in the fretzdorf rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth , left , of the green party has distanced herself from the peace marches leaders of germany 's green party , traditionally strong supporters of the marches , had distanced themselves from the organizers , accusing them of focusing exclusively on anti-militarism . greens chairwoman claudia roth referred to a " monochrome viewpoint " and " blanket rejection of the military , " and many prominent greens stayed away . germany 's easter marches gained their inspiration from britain 's campaign for nuclear disarmament of the 1950s .
in 1968 , when protest against the vietnam war was at its height , an estimated 300,000 marched . the all-time high was reached in 1983 , when 700,000 marched through west german cities in protest at the stationing of medium- range nuclear weapons in europe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2007 europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within back to first page back 2/2 violent anarchist groups infiltrating protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anarchists attach themselves to left-wing causes in addition to the improved coordination of groups and the attendances at demonstrations , violence has been another aspect of recent protests which has been on the rise . the may day protests in germany rarely pass without a car or two being set on fire , but it is almost out of tradition that the police allow a few vehicles to be sacrificed to appease the anarchists and avoid confrontation . at other more international demonstrations , however , violent confrontation has increased in both regularity and intensity .
while this could also suggest a coordinated approach , it is something guy taylor does not agree with . " it is very rare that the groups involved in protests come under pressure from certain organizations to react violently , " taylor said .
" the effect of being ignored by the politicians annoys some and as a result they see a need of a more ' radical ' way of protesting , but this is not an argument that gets a lot of support in our group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive police force has been blamed for violence according to him , when a protest turns violent , it is rarely the case that the outbreak has been premeditated or organized by protest groups , since most groups ' small size precludes them from large-scale coordination . " more often than not , the only organization capable of igniting a riot is the police , " he said .
" massive protests have passed off peacefully despite radical and angry demonstrators being treated with contempt because the police have been careful not to provoke . " traveling for trouble the university of antwerp 's mudde says the radical left holds very diverse views and tactics , but in general , the majority do not follow a violent ideology .
however , anarchists and violent protesters of the so-called black bloc movement are violent revolutionaries and are relatively mobile .
the black bloc is a so-called " affinity group " which comes together during protests .
the name comes from the black clothing and masks they wear , which make them appear to be one large mass and also hinders identification by authorities . they have links through the squatter scene in places like germany and the netherlands , but comprise a fairly small group of individuals , as few as 200 , which could be described as professional protestors , according to mudde . professor luke march , an expert on left-wing extremism in europe , agrees with the view that most left-wing groups are decidedly non-violent and most are n't anti-democratic . " the violent groups are more correctly usually anarchists , animal rights and radical environmental groups , " he said . " these groups may march alongside left-wingers but their concerns are somewhat different and they do n't have strong links to them . "
recent examples , such as the riots in copenhagen over the closing of a youth center which attracted radical left-wing extremists from around europe , indicate that some activists are willing to travel to violently support causes in other countries .
one far-left group which was involved in the copenhagen demonstrations , the anarchist black cross , organizes protests around the world . " it must be noted that many moderate left-wingers now stay away from this type of protest , " said mudde .
" it is the more radical element that attends . " left-wing , not far-right , unrest at g8 bildunterschrift : as the june g8 summit approaches , there are fears of further disorder as left-wing groups are concerned that german right-wing extremists might infiltrate the protests .
but cas mudde believes that if there is trouble , it will come from the radical left 's anarchic factions . " the far-left and far-right share similar feelings towards globalization , " he says .
" but they will not mix .
they will stage their own demonstrations away from each other , and i believe the far-right extremists will not go in search of confrontation with the left .

recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president .

" at midnight the operational squadron with the six recce tornados and their additional personnel deployed here were placed under nato command , " spokesman hartmut beilmann told deutsche presse-agentur on monday . two of the aircraft had undertaken a 90-minute acclimatization flight on monday , beilmann said , speaking from camp marmal near mazar-e sharif in northern afghanistan , where the squadron is based . " the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .

" at midnight the operational squadron with the six recce tornados and their additional personnel deployed here were placed under nato command , " spokesman hartmut beilmann told deutsche presse-agentur on monday . two of the aircraft had undertaken a 90-minute acclimatization flight on monday , beilmann said , speaking from camp marmal near mazar-e sharif in northern afghanistan , where the squadron is based . " the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .
the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .
a recent survey showed 74 percent feared it could trigger terrorist attacks in germany . most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country . nato-led forces recently launched an offensive against the taliban , which claims to have thousands of suicide bombers across afghanistan . peace marches at home meanwhile , peace activists held traditional peace marches throughout germany over the easter weekend , but the numbers attending were well down from the movement 's heyday some 25 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 people took part in the 2007 frankfurt easter march the marchers called for an end to the deployment of german troops abroad , including the reconstruction mission in northern afghanistan and , in particular , the deployment of the tornados . the organizers of the marches said tens of thousands had participated in events in around 80 towns and cities across the country throughout the easter weekend . the main rallies on monday were held in frankfurt and hamburg , where up to 2,000 gathered in each city . the largest rally of the weekend occurred on sunday at fretzdorf , north of berlin , where police put the total at 3,000 , while organizers said 10,000 had taken part . the movement opposes plans by the defense ministry to reopen an military exercise zone there for low-flying jets that was used by soviet forces during the communist era . political support prominent members of the local social democrats took part in the fretzdorf rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth , left , of the green party has distanced herself from the peace marches leaders of germany 's green party , traditionally strong supporters of the marches , had distanced themselves from the organizers , accusing them of focusing exclusively on anti-militarism . greens chairwoman claudia roth referred to a " monochrome viewpoint " and " blanket rejection of the military , " and many prominent greens stayed away . germany 's easter marches gained their inspiration from britain 's campaign for nuclear disarmament of the 1950s .
in 1968 , when protest against the vietnam war was at its height , an estimated 300,000 marched . the all-time high was reached in 1983 , when 700,000 marched through west german cities in protest at the stationing of medium- range nuclear weapons in europe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

" at midnight the operational squadron with the six recce tornados and their additional personnel deployed here were placed under nato command , " spokesman hartmut beilmann told deutsche presse-agentur on monday . two of the aircraft had undertaken a 90-minute acclimatization flight on monday , beilmann said , speaking from camp marmal near mazar-e sharif in northern afghanistan , where the squadron is based . " the jets will cover 90 percent of the afghan airspace , " beilmann said . the exact area of coverage will be determined by nato .
the aircraft , which carry two hi-tech optical cameras each plus an infra-red sensor , are to begin full operations in mid-april after arriving at the german base on thursday . some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based . a controversial mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peace activists have been opposing their country 's mission in afghanistan the aircraft are to relay coordinates for potential bombing targets to ground troops of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- battling remnants of the ousted taliban in the southern provinces . the mission is controversial at home .

in 1968 , when protest against the vietnam war was at its height , an estimated 300,000 marched . the all-time high was reached in 1983 , when 700,000 marched through west german cities in protest at the stationing of medium- range nuclear weapons in europe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .
it was from here that sarkozy made his fateful " scum " comment . le pen , who stunned the nation when he made it to second place in the 2002 election , is polling in fourth place behind former education minister francois bayrou . the other contenders are three trotskyite candidates , a communist and a green , anti-globalization campaigner jose bove , a hunters ' party candidate who champions rural interests and the catholic nationalist philippe de villiers - none of whom are expected to garner more than 3 percent of the vote . " as sexy as a phone book " although the candidates have been sparring for months , easter monday marks the first day of the official election period when the 12 presidential candidates are allowed to put up posters in front of their 85,000 electoral offices .
each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book .

recent surveys , however , suggest more voters are undecided this time around than in the previous presidential election . hundreds of thousands of french - especially young people from ethnic minorities living in deprived areas - have registered to take part in the elections for the first time , but it seems candidates have failed to convince voters they are the best man , or woman , for the job .
a survey by pollsters csa published in sunday 's le parisien found around 18 million voters - or some 42 percent of the electorate - are still unsure of which candidate to plump for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac announced last month he would not seek a third term as president an ifop survey published at the end of last week came to a similar conclusion .
the number is 10 percentage points more than in 2002 , according to frederic dabi from ifop .
dabi saw the results as reflecting " insecurity over what 's on offer . " many voters obviously doubted whether the main candidates were " capable of filling the office , " dabi said . the first round of polling begins on april 22 .
if no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the vote , the election goes to a second round between the two leading candidates on may 6 . sarkozy lead widens right-wing sarkozy , who has recently hardened his stance on crime and immigration , has consistently led opinion polls and has picked up a few points over royal in recent days . an ifop survey for the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday gave sarkozy 29.5 points in the first round vote , a three and a half point rise from the previous ifop poll .
royal lost three first round points to 22 , her lowest score in six months .
the survey showed that sarkozy would comfortably beat her with 54 points to 46 in the second round . royal responded to the latest results by saying the pollsters were incapable of measuring opinions in a reliable way . the french " are n't answering surveys anymore , " royal said , adding that young people in city suburbs were n't counted in the poll because they do n't have fixed phone lines . sarkozy has much to lose if ethnic voters from city suburbs turn out in force .
during the riots in there in late 2005 , sarkozy , who was then interior minister , called the rioting youths " scum " and was criticized for his tough policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent riots in late 2005 spread to poor housing estates in many areas of france sarkozy has not yet made a campaign visit to the cities ' fringes something even far-right front national leader , jean-marie le pen , managed last friday in a symbolic visit to the paris suburb of argenteuil .

each candidate also has 45 minutes of free time on public television and radio channels , split into commercials up to five and half minutes long . broadcasters are also now legally obliged to spread coverage of each candidate equally around the clock , strictly dividing interview time and reports on their campaigns . in an editorial , the french daily liberation warned the rules were based on " a neutrality that is as hypocritical as it is fictitious " and had " no chance of clearing the record levels of indecision that is the hallmark of this 2007 election . " " the 12 candidates will have the same space to develop their ideas , when only three of them - sarkozy , royal and bayrou - have any chance of applying them as president . " the paper also complained that the rules would make the " television campaign about as sexy as reading the telephone book .

" tough game " bremen , who also played out a scoreless draw last weekend against energie cottbus and in the uefa cup against az alkmaar on thursday , once again struggled to find the net against nuremberg . in a turgid first half , the closest thomas schaaf 's side came to a scoring opportunity occurred after 26 minutes when an off-balance aaron hunt found himself in space in the area but failed to hit the target . hugo almeda twice went close for bremen in the early stages of the second half before rosenberg bundled home the winner with 15 minutes remaining having come on just five minutes earlier .

not surprisingly , haggui was hauled off shortly afterwards and replaced by andrey voronin . stefan kiessling pulled one back for leverkusen shortly after the hour mark to make it 3-1 but later saw red for making a comment to referee peter gagelmann .

a charter on the issue published by the national union of teachers stresses the responsibilities they all have .
it says the boys themselves must develop their own learning and parents must support them and their schools .
schools must encourage them to have high expectations and have " a moral commitment " to raise and promote their achievements , the nut added .
the charter , published at the union 's annual conference , in harrogate , was compiled with the collaboration of groups of black boys in london , birmingham and manchester .
expectations one of them , 16-year-old dillon max-grant , who is taking his as-levels , said he got involved because he knew people who were not achieving as well as they should be .
he said the often quoted issue of family breakdown and absentee fathers in black communities was " not really the issue " .
" it 's up to them to try to succeed , " he said , but added that parental expectations were important .
sometimes , because of their social circumstances , their expectations did not match the abilities of the students and the capabilities of the schools that taught them .
they need to organise themselves to demand much more of the school system gus john a co-author of the charter , education expert gus john , said : " if there is a theme that runs through the report , the theme is let us all live up to our responsibilities . "
that applied to everyone - but youngsters themselves had to be responsible for their own learning along with " their mums and dads and their schools " .
" i think it 's nothing short of a national scandal that , 60 years after the empire windrush brought some 300 people from the caribbean to these shores , young black boys , afro-caribbean boys , are still underachieving at the rate at which they are , " mr john said .
' mayhem ' that culture contributed to " the sort of mayhem in our communities that we have seen in the past weeks " - with black boys being stabbed to death .
" in some parts of the country the life expectancy of young afro-caribbean males is 25 , " he said - such as in his home city of manchester .

' unwitting racism ' kay hampton , chairman of the commission for racial equality , said the nut should not focus solely on underachievement among black boys .
" the issue of underachievement is not restricted to african-caribbean boys as such but to a wide range of people , including for example gypsy traveller communities and other minority communities for example females within certain communities as well .
" so the idea is a good one , but we would urge that the bigger picture of underachievement in education is taken into consideration as well . "
recently the department for education and skills published a report which said black pupils were routinely punished more harshly , praised less and told off more often in english schools than other pupils .
it said staff in many schools were " unwittingly " racist .
a spokesperson for the department said : " black pupils demonstrated nationally the greatest progress in gcse results of any ethnic group , improving more than twice as fast as the average , with promising results for 11 and 14-year-olds boding well for the future .

a charter on the issue published by the national union of teachers stresses the responsibilities they all have .
it says the boys themselves must develop their own learning and parents must support them and their schools .
schools must encourage them to have high expectations and have " a moral commitment " to raise and promote their achievements , the nut added .
the charter , published at the union 's annual conference , in harrogate , was compiled with the collaboration of groups of black boys in london , birmingham and manchester .
expectations one of them , 16-year-old dillon max-grant , who is taking his as-levels , said he got involved because he knew people who were not achieving as well as they should be .
he said the often quoted issue of family breakdown and absentee fathers in black communities was " not really the issue " .
" it 's up to them to try to succeed , " he said , but added that parental expectations were important .
sometimes , because of their social circumstances , their expectations did not match the abilities of the students and the capabilities of the schools that taught them .
they need to organise themselves to demand much more of the school system gus john a co-author of the charter , education expert gus john , said : " if there is a theme that runs through the report , the theme is let us all live up to our responsibilities . "
that applied to everyone - but youngsters themselves had to be responsible for their own learning along with " their mums and dads and their schools " .
" i think it 's nothing short of a national scandal that , 60 years after the empire windrush brought some 300 people from the caribbean to these shores , young black boys , afro-caribbean boys , are still underachieving at the rate at which they are , " mr john said .
' mayhem ' that culture contributed to " the sort of mayhem in our communities that we have seen in the past weeks " - with black boys being stabbed to death .
" in some parts of the country the life expectancy of young afro-caribbean males is 25 , " he said - such as in his home city of manchester .
there was a culture of low expectations on the part of the boys themselves and those who taught them , he said .
" many of the parents themselves who have children in schools now have been schooled in a culture of low expectations .
black pupils demonstrated nationally the greatest progress in gcse results of any ethnic group dfes spokesperson " they need to organise themselves to demand much more of the school system . "
nut general secretary steve sinnott said : " we wo n't get the changes that are required unless everybody does their part .
" that includes the youngsters .
they ca n't turn round and point the finger and blame everybody else . "
' unwitting racism ' kay hampton , chairman of the commission for racial equality , said the nut should not focus solely on underachievement among black boys .
" the issue of underachievement is not restricted to african-caribbean boys as such but to a wide range of people , including for example gypsy traveller communities and other minority communities for example females within certain communities as well .
" so the idea is a good one , but we would urge that the bigger picture of underachievement in education is taken into consideration as well . "
recently the department for education and skills published a report which said black pupils were routinely punished more harshly , praised less and told off more often in english schools than other pupils .
it said staff in many schools were " unwittingly " racist .
a spokesperson for the department said : " black pupils demonstrated nationally the greatest progress in gcse results of any ethnic group , improving more than twice as fast as the average , with promising results for 11 and 14-year-olds boding well for the future .

shamiam arif was discovered by an aid worker from dumfries who brought her to the uk for treatment in chelmsford to repair her scalp , eyes and face .
she was burned after a candle set fire to her bed .
campaigners from dumfries and galloway raised more than £ 20,000 to build a new home for the family in kashmir .
she and her family are based in luton with relatives , having first come to the uk for shamiam 's treatment three years ago .
her first operations closed a gaping wound in her scalp , enabling her to close her eyes and blink , and straightened her arms which had become bent in the fire .
dumfries restaurant worker farooq ahmed , who is also a special police constable , started the appeal to bring her to the uk for treatment .
before their departure for the kotli region of kashmir , shamiam 's family thanked local police for their fundraising efforts .
a total of £ 140,000 has been raised to date , with most spent on surgery for shamiam .
her return to kashmir brings to an end three years of operations to stabilise her skull , provide basic hand and finger functions as well as skin grafts and physiotherapy .

england would still be scotland 's " biggest pal " if the two nations split , the scottish national party 's leader has told the bbc .
alex salmond denied that independence for scotland would cause chaos , saying the two countries could be good and " friendly neighbours " .
mr salmond said the snp was on course to win control of the scottish parliament in next month 's elections .
he denied that independence would create border or passport problems .
' prominent economist ' in an interview with bbc radio 4 's today programme the snp leader said that just as there was no need of a passport " to visit your cousin in cork " , there would be no need for one to " to visit your granny in grimsby " .
the snp has already said it would hold a referendum on independence in 2010 - towards the end of its first four-year term if it were to take power at holyrood - at a cost of £ 7m .
labour has called the independence proposal a ticking tax bomb .
mr salmond dismissed claims that his party 's figures did not add up .
he said : " probably scotland 's prominent economist of the last generation , professor david simpson - for 20 years the economic analyst for standard life - said our sums did add up .
so that is a matter of political debate .
" we know our sums add up .
both in terms of what we want to do in a devolved government and in terms of the appetite and plans for independence . "
after independence , england will still be our biggest pal , our biggest friend , our biggest trading partner alex salmond he said he was happy that his party 's plans were leading the political debate .
mr salmond said the current scottish executive was an " over-mighty bureaucracy " from which efficiency savings of 1.5 % " year on year " were " realistic " .
the snp leader said the element of proportional representation in the scottish parliament meant it was unlikely that any one party would have an overall majority after the election .
a number of opinion polls over the past few weeks have indicated the snp could be the largest party after the 3 may election .
mr salmond said he had only ruled out forming a coalition with one party - the scottish conservatives .
' unwanted policies ' this , he said , was due to its " traditional range of anti-scottish policies " .
he said that the best way to find out if people were in favour of " negotiating scotland into an independent and sovereign state " was to hold a referendum .
mr salmond added that the weight of polling evidence suggested the scottish people were in favour of the question being asked .
when asked about how people south of the border , especially those with relatives in scotland , would feel about scottish independence , he said : " i think the vast majority of the people in england would say , ' let the scots have the right to decide their own future ' . "
mr salmond said : " i think a lot of people in england can see the advantages of the people of england being able to decide on things like foundation hospitals or top-up fees , without being bossed around by scottish labour mps , who seem intent on forcing unwanted policies down the throats of the people of england . "
he added : " after independence , england will still be our biggest pal , our biggest friend , our biggest trading partner and people both north and south of the border find that a very attractive proposition . "

england would still be scotland 's " biggest pal " if the two nations split , the scottish national party 's leader has told the bbc .
alex salmond denied that independence for scotland would cause chaos , saying the two countries could be good and " friendly neighbours " .
mr salmond said the snp was on course to win control of the scottish parliament in next month 's elections .
he denied that independence would create border or passport problems .
' prominent economist ' in an interview with bbc radio 4 's today programme the snp leader said that just as there was no need of a passport " to visit your cousin in cork " , there would be no need for one to " to visit your granny in grimsby " .
the snp has already said it would hold a referendum on independence in 2010 - towards the end of its first four-year term if it were to take power at holyrood - at a cost of £ 7m .
labour has called the independence proposal a ticking tax bomb .
mr salmond dismissed claims that his party 's figures did not add up .
he said : " probably scotland 's prominent economist of the last generation , professor david simpson - for 20 years the economic analyst for standard life - said our sums did add up .
so that is a matter of political debate .
" we know our sums add up .
both in terms of what we want to do in a devolved government and in terms of the appetite and plans for independence . "
after independence , england will still be our biggest pal , our biggest friend , our biggest trading partner alex salmond he said he was happy that his party 's plans were leading the political debate .
mr salmond said the current scottish executive was an " over-mighty bureaucracy " from which efficiency savings of 1.5 % " year on year " were " realistic " .
the snp leader said the element of proportional representation in the scottish parliament meant it was unlikely that any one party would have an overall majority after the election .
a number of opinion polls over the past few weeks have indicated the snp could be the largest party after the 3 may election .
mr salmond said he had only ruled out forming a coalition with one party - the scottish conservatives .
' unwanted policies ' this , he said , was due to its " traditional range of anti-scottish policies " .
he said that the best way to find out if people were in favour of " negotiating scotland into an independent and sovereign state " was to hold a referendum .
mr salmond added that the weight of polling evidence suggested the scottish people were in favour of the question being asked .
when asked about how people south of the border , especially those with relatives in scotland , would feel about scottish independence , he said : " i think the vast majority of the people in england would say , ' let the scots have the right to decide their own future ' . "
mr salmond said : " i think a lot of people in england can see the advantages of the people of england being able to decide on things like foundation hospitals or top-up fees , without being bossed around by scottish labour mps , who seem intent on forcing unwanted policies down the throats of the people of england . "
he added : " after independence , england will still be our biggest pal , our biggest friend , our biggest trading partner and people both north and south of the border find that a very attractive proposition . "

most commentators accuse us president george w bush and his allies of turning the country into a " republic of real fear " , although some do describe the iraqi insurgency as a shining example of resistance to foreign occupation .
izz-al-din al-darwish in syria 's tishrin the us administration insists on swimming against the tide and continues to deceive the american public by lying about the war against iraq and its foreign policy .
it should ... publicly admit its mistakes and apologise to the americans and the iraqis before it is too late .
iran 's reformist e 'temad-e melli it is time we asked about the cost of toppling saddam .
bush and his team have upset the balance of the region and caused its people enormous pain .
the consequences of the americans ' imprudent attack on iraq are irreversible .
ghassan sharbal in pan-arab al-hayat four years on , there are as many deaths as there are palm trees in iraq .
george bush committed a great foolishness that brought catastrophe to the nation of iraq and long-term damage to the security of the region and the world .
pan-arab al-arab al-alamiyah four years on from the fall of baghdad , no-one among the iraqi people has emerged carrying white ... flags , as bush , cheney , rumsfeld and tony blair dreamed they would .
abd-al-bari atwan in pan-arab al-quds al-arabi today , on the fourth anniversary of the fall of baghdad , iraq is experiencing the worst conditions it has ever seen .
there is no water , electricity or security , no schools , universities or hospitals .
the only things readily available are graves and mortuaries .
iraq today is a republic of real fear , whose people are escaping in hundreds and thousands .
it is living through the worst kind of torture and death .
saudi arabia 's al-watan after four years of occupation , the facts , figures and course of events show that the biggest loser is the iraqi people .
a single glance at iraq on the anniversary of its occupation is enough to know the magnitude of the humanitarian tragedy iraqis are living through .
ahmad dahbur in palestinian al-hayat al-jadidah the ninth of april is a sad day .
baghdad became the second arab capital after jerusalem to fall to invaders ...
today , iraqi resistance fighters are showing the entire world a great example of the prophecy which says that all occupations are destined to fail .

izz-al-din al-darwish in syria 's tishrin the us administration insists on swimming against the tide and continues to deceive the american public by lying about the war against iraq and its foreign policy .

pan-arab al-arab al-alamiyah four years on from the fall of baghdad , no-one among the iraqi people has emerged carrying white ... flags , as bush , cheney , rumsfeld and tony blair dreamed they would .
abd-al-bari atwan in pan-arab al-quds al-arabi today , on the fourth anniversary of the fall of baghdad , iraq is experiencing the worst conditions it has ever seen .
there is no water , electricity or security , no schools , universities or hospitals .
the only things readily available are graves and mortuaries .
iraq today is a republic of real fear , whose people are escaping in hundreds and thousands .
it is living through the worst kind of torture and death .
saudi arabia 's al-watan after four years of occupation , the facts , figures and course of events show that the biggest loser is the iraqi people .

qatar 's al-watan at a time when bloody chaos and destruction is spreading in iraq , the us administration has no political solution to the crisis .

it is full of carp , sturgeon and flounder - just two years ago he could not have even dreamt of this catch .
" all thanks to the dam , " alek grins as he throws the fish into a growing pile on the bottom of his rowing boat .
the dam is part of a $ 68m project , initiated by the kazakh government and financed by loans from the world bank .
it is an ambitious undertaking that aims to reverse one of the world 's worst man-made environmental disasters and bring back the sea which many predicted could never return .
" the aral sea did not die , the aral sea was murdered , " said nazhbagin musabaev , the governor of the aralsk region .
' die gracefully ' mr musabaev remembers how in the late 1960s the soviet government held a plenary session in the uzbek capital tashkent , during which the deputy minister of irrigation and water resources of the ussr talked about the government plans for boosting the region 's cotton production .
the two main central asian rivers amu darya and syr darya , he said , would be diverted to irrigate the cotton plantations in kazakhstan and uzbekistan .
" but what will happen to the aral ? " someone from the audience shouted .
" the aral , " the deputy minister responded , " will have to die off gracefully . "
disaster but the death of the aral was far from graceful .
more fishermen are taking their boats to the north as the water-starved sea shrank , the desert spread , changing the climate , destroying the eco-system , eradicating entire species and forcing thousands of people to flee .
every year fishermen would have to travel further and further to get to the water , and every year there would be less and less fish left to catch .
desertification and rising salt levels in the shrinking sea brought salt storms .
diseases , like anaemia and cancer , swept through communities .
by the 1990s the world 's fourth largest inland body of water had shrunk to a quarter of its size .
today , dropped in the middle of the grey desert is the village of dzhambul , once home to a thriving fishing community .
dotting the area , which was once the deepest point of the aral , are skeletons of rusting ships .
next to them , camels graze on the colourless dry grass that pokes out from the grey sand .
future hopes jalkasbai , a fisherman from dzhambul , remembers the days when life here was very different .
" all my childhood i was going fishing with my father and my brothers , but my sons grew up without the sea , " jalkasbai said .
" but now , i hope my grandchildren will have a chance to become fishermen . "
it is a six-hour drive across the desert to get to the place that has given jalkasbai , and thousands like him , hope for the future .
the recently constructed 13km dam has split the aral sea in two parts .
the dam did not solve the entire problem .
on the uzbek side the southern sea continues to shrink .
rusting ships stand as monuments to the disaster " the uzbek government needs to hurry if they want to preserve at least some of the sea , " mr musambaev said .
but he added , that was no longer kazakhstan 's problem .
in kazakhstan , the dam has allowed the river to feed the northern aral and as a result the sea has been pushing back into the desert .
kazakh officials say 40 % of the water has already returned .
the fishermen are back in their boats .
the clouds and the rain have returned .
a short drive away from the dam , a group of fishermen camp out in tents by the shore .
jandos kumanov spent his entire winter here .
the sea is still too far from his home village , but the increasing number of fish made the trip worthwhile .
" in the last two years life has become easier , " he said .
" you can see fishermen are now building houses , buying cars , and sending their children to schools outside the big cities " and it may all get even better .
using a new $ 126m world bank loan , the government now plans to build a second dam , which they hope will bring the water back to the port of aralsk .
" the sea has left the harbour , but it has n't left our hearts , " reads a dilapidated sign in the dried-up aralsk harbour .
the dam has helped the northern aral sea grow by 40 % aralsk , a grim , rundown provincial town , was once home to the biggest port along the aral coastline .
the aral is still at least 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away from the harbour , but the second stage of the project , the government says , could bring it back by 2010 .
this is what everyone in aralsk seems to be waiting for .
as a group of school boys climb the abandoned ships in the aralsk harbour , one of them , an 11-year-old called baurzhan , says he has heard about the aral from his grandfather , but has never actually seen the sea .
" but it 's okay , " baurzhan said .
" the sea will be back soon .
that 's what my grandfather says and i believe my grandfather . "

every year fishermen would have to travel further and further to get to the water , and every year there would be less and less fish left to catch .
desertification and rising salt levels in the shrinking sea brought salt storms .
diseases , like anaemia and cancer , swept through communities .
by the 1990s the world 's fourth largest inland body of water had shrunk to a quarter of its size .
today , dropped in the middle of the grey desert is the village of dzhambul , once home to a thriving fishing community .
dotting the area , which was once the deepest point of the aral , are skeletons of rusting ships .
next to them , camels graze on the colourless dry grass that pokes out from the grey sand .
future hopes jalkasbai , a fisherman from dzhambul , remembers the days when life here was very different .
" all my childhood i was going fishing with my father and my brothers , but my sons grew up without the sea , " jalkasbai said .
" but now , i hope my grandchildren will have a chance to become fishermen . "
it is a six-hour drive across the desert to get to the place that has given jalkasbai , and thousands like him , hope for the future .
the recently constructed 13km dam has split the aral sea in two parts .
the dam did not solve the entire problem .
on the uzbek side the southern sea continues to shrink .
rusting ships stand as monuments to the disaster " the uzbek government needs to hurry if they want to preserve at least some of the sea , " mr musambaev said .
but he added , that was no longer kazakhstan 's problem .
in kazakhstan , the dam has allowed the river to feed the northern aral and as a result the sea has been pushing back into the desert .
kazakh officials say 40 % of the water has already returned .
the fishermen are back in their boats .
the clouds and the rain have returned .
a short drive away from the dam , a group of fishermen camp out in tents by the shore .
jandos kumanov spent his entire winter here .
the sea is still too far from his home village , but the increasing number of fish made the trip worthwhile .
" in the last two years life has become easier , " he said .
" you can see fishermen are now building houses , buying cars , and sending their children to schools outside the big cities " and it may all get even better .
using a new $ 126m world bank loan , the government now plans to build a second dam , which they hope will bring the water back to the port of aralsk .
" the sea has left the harbour , but it has n't left our hearts , " reads a dilapidated sign in the dried-up aralsk harbour .
the dam has helped the northern aral sea grow by 40 % aralsk , a grim , rundown provincial town , was once home to the biggest port along the aral coastline .
the aral is still at least 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away from the harbour , but the second stage of the project , the government says , could bring it back by 2010 .
this is what everyone in aralsk seems to be waiting for .
as a group of school boys climb the abandoned ships in the aralsk harbour , one of them , an 11-year-old called baurzhan , says he has heard about the aral from his grandfather , but has never actually seen the sea .
" but it 's okay , " baurzhan said .
" the sea will be back soon .
that 's what my grandfather says and i believe my grandfather . "

the move follows years of campaigning by parents for megan 's law - named after a similar rule which was introduced in the us .
north east somerset will be the first area to test the scheme after the idea was championed by local mp dan norris .
two other tests will follow after it is introduced to mr norris 's constituency in wansdyke .
' prospective partners ' the law allows public access to some information on the history and whereabouts of some high-risk sex offenders , which supporters say has been a valuable deterrent and an important tool for curbing their activities .
mr norris was first approached about the introduction of a megan 's law in the uk in 1998 .
the former child welfare officer told bbc news : " i think there is an argument for full disclosure but it has to be done incrementally .
" at the moment we are concerned with three areas : lone parents , people who want to know if there are serial offenders in their area and for head teachers to be aware of any offenders around their schools .
" when there has been vigilantism , these people go underground and then we do n't know what they 're doing , that 's why we 're having these tests . "
michele elliott , director of children 's charity kidscape , said the decision was a " massive breakthrough " for parents .
ms elliott said : " i am delighted that this is happening .
it is happening with a great deal of planning and thought , and we will see how it works in these controlled circumstances . "
' greater risk ' but martin narey of the charity barnado 's told the bbc that the pilot schemes would put children at even greater risk , because convicted paedophiles would be driven underground : " we at barnado 's are very clear .
this will put children in more danger , not less danger .
" sex offenders can be very dangerous people .
their dangerousness is reduced by the police and the probation service keeping them under rigorous supervision .
" we at barnado 's would say make that supervision more rigorous by using satellite tracking and giving them lie detector tests .
" but one thing is for sure .
if they flee supervision then they will be very dangerous indeed and that 's what we ca n't allow .
that will lead , eventually , to the loss of children 's lives . "

the move follows years of campaigning by parents for megan 's law - named after a similar rule which was introduced in the us .
north east somerset will be the first area to test the scheme after the idea was championed by local mp dan norris .
two other tests will follow after it is introduced to mr norris 's constituency in wansdyke .
' prospective partners ' the law allows public access to some information on the history and whereabouts of some high-risk sex offenders , which supporters say has been a valuable deterrent and an important tool for curbing their activities .
mr norris was first approached about the introduction of a megan 's law in the uk in 1998 .
the former child welfare officer told bbc news : " i think there is an argument for full disclosure but it has to be done incrementally .
" at the moment we are concerned with three areas : lone parents , people who want to know if there are serial offenders in their area and for head teachers to be aware of any offenders around their schools .
" when there has been vigilantism , these people go underground and then we do n't know what they 're doing , that 's why we 're having these tests . "
michele elliott , director of children 's charity kidscape , said the decision was a " massive breakthrough " for parents .
ms elliott said : " i am delighted that this is happening .
it is happening with a great deal of planning and thought , and we will see how it works in these controlled circumstances . "
' greater risk ' but martin narey of the charity barnado 's told the bbc that the pilot schemes would put children at even greater risk , because convicted paedophiles would be driven underground : " we at barnado 's are very clear .
this will put children in more danger , not less danger .
" sex offenders can be very dangerous people .
their dangerousness is reduced by the police and the probation service keeping them under rigorous supervision .
" we at barnado 's would say make that supervision more rigorous by using satellite tracking and giving them lie detector tests .

if they flee supervision then they will be very dangerous indeed and that 's what we ca n't allow .

the move follows years of campaigning by parents for megan 's law - named after a similar rule which was introduced in the us .
north east somerset will be the first area to test the scheme after the idea was championed by local mp dan norris .
two other tests will follow after it is introduced to mr norris 's constituency in wansdyke .
' prospective partners ' the law allows public access to some information on the history and whereabouts of some high-risk sex offenders , which supporters say has been a valuable deterrent and an important tool for curbing their activities .
mr norris was first approached about the introduction of a megan 's law in the uk in 1998 .
the former child welfare officer told bbc news : " i think there is an argument for full disclosure but it has to be done incrementally .
" at the moment we are concerned with three areas : lone parents , people who want to know if there are serial offenders in their area and for head teachers to be aware of any offenders around their schools .
" when there has been vigilantism , these people go underground and then we do n't know what they 're doing , that 's why we 're having these tests . "
michele elliott , director of children 's charity kidscape , said the decision was a " massive breakthrough " for parents .

it is happening with a great deal of planning and thought , and we will see how it works in these controlled circumstances . "

the difference between online and offline , the web and the desktop will blur in the near future , mozilla 's mike schroepfer has said .
the vice-president of engineering at the home of the firefox browser said small changes to the way the web works will have a big impact in the coming years .
" things that are impossible or hard to do now , will be possible or very easy , " he said .
big plans firefox is the world 's second-most popular browser with a 12 % market share .
" we have got planned road maps for next three to four years at least and that 's over the horizon that we can see , " said mr schroepfer .
" if you think of your browser fundamentally as your gateway to the web then we must ask , ' what are the capabilities of the web ?
are we done evolving the web ? '
" the answer to that is ' absolutely no ' . "
one of the biggest changes to the way people use the web will surface in the third release of firefox .
" i have been demonstrating recently support for using web applications offline - the ability to take your web-based e-mail , calendar , rss feeds and access all the old content even when i do n't have net access . "
with more and more people using web-based applications rather than desktop software their usefulness often stops when access to the net ends .
internet explorer is still the most widely used web browser " perhaps i am on an airplane , wi-fi access is bad .
it happens a lot when you travel .
" accessing data at all times is one of the things you can do on the desktop , but you ca n't do on the web today .
" we are going to remove that block when firefox 3 ships . "
community change firefox is an open source browser built by a community of developers around the world - about 2,000 contributed code to firefox 2 and tens of thousands of people test nightly versions of firefox .
mr schroepfer said the release of javascript 2 - the fundamental technology that powers many of the advanced features of the web - would have a big impact on the flexibility of web applications .
" people are doing these things now in spite of the technology .
we want technology on the web to catch up with people 's creativity .
" what we 're just seeing today people are building on browser technology of four years ago . "
data games mozilla is also experimenting with using structured data on the web so that applications can use data intelligently .
knowing the difference between a phone number or an address , for example , makes that information more valuable and flexible .
" with a little bit of structured data we can add things automatically from web pages to calendars , or you can click to dial with voip , or export an address to contacts .
firefox aims to help when wi-fi access is patchy " we only need minor tweaks to web pages to get that to work . "
more long term , mozilla is working on making the web a much more three-dimensional world .
" for firefox 4 , we 're working on a lot of innovations to advance the state of graphics and text rendering on the web , " brendan eich , chief technical officer of the mozilla foundation , told the bbc 's digital planet recently .
users can expect firefox to improve its display with developments in " smooth text and magazine-style layout " .
adobe and microsoft are currently developing 3d rendering engines for webpages and desktop applications but mr eich stressed that these technologies should be developed as open source software .
" it should be done in an open standard way that all browsers can implement .
you should n't have to get a proprietary run-time to take advantage of these features . "
mr schroepfer said that the work to create and develop an open source browser solution continued .
" the game is n't over , the war is n't won .
" a lot of things we believe in around security and privacy we do n't see implemented in other browsers . "
with 500,000 copies of firefox downloaded each day , it would seem a lot of people agree with him .
