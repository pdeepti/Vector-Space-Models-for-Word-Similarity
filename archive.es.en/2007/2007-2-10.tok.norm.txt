" it does n't make sense for russia not to be a full member , " steinbrück said . political motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian finance minister alexei kudrin wants russia to join the world 's richest club russia does join the members of the g7 - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - to form the group of eight for annual summits on political and broad economic matters .
but moscow has yet to make it into the group of seven , which focuses exclusively on financial issues such as global growth , exchange rates , trade and oil prices . " there are evidently political motives that stand in the way of our full membership of the g8 finance group , " kudrin told germany 's daily die welt newspaper .
" russia successfully pursued its economic growth strategy last year and i believe that as finance ministers we are ready to meet in full g8 format . " surpassing italy and france russia 's absence from group of seven finance deliberations has been attributed to the relatively small size of its economy when compared to current g7 members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees itself as an energy superpower but kudrin , addressing the press in moscow on thursday , said the russian economy had surpassed that of italy last year and should eclipse france in 2009 . " we are a real economy , which attracts investment and has a good pace of development , " he said . with the ruble now fully convertible , russia last year received inward capital flows amounting to $ 41.5 billion -lrb- 31.9 billion euros -rrb- , according to kudrin . expanding makes sense according to germany 's finance minister , expanding the g7 block would be a logical step to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators at the g7 meeting asked for greater spending on poverty and aids " there are so many issues where it simply does n't make sense not to discuss them without important emerging countries like china , india , south africa , brazil and australia to name but a few , " steinbrück said .
" i think we should also have them at the table . " there 's no formalized process as yet .
but my personal opinion is that in two , three , four years , we 'll no longer have the g7-g8 , but a g10 or a g14 , " he said . steinbrück pointed out that " it is practically already the case " that a number of emerging countries participate in the talks . in addition to russia , five other non-g7 states are here this weekend as guests , china , brazil , india , mexico and south africa . a question of principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody is convinced that china should join the g7 steinbrück 's enthusiasm for china 's inclusion appeared to stand in contrast to a position by german chancellor angela merkel , who at a group of eight summit in saint petersburg last july suggested that now is not the time to consider beijing 's admission . " the g8 groups countries that play a certain role in the world economy and that observe a certain number of principles , such as intellectual property rights , and for the moment i see no need to change that , " she said at the time . china is routinely accused by its trading partners of not taking sufficiently robust action against counterfeited goods . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off a two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

the g7 - britain , france , canada , germany , italy , japan and the united states - in addition appealed for " vigilance " on hedge funds , a trillion-dollar industry that has grown strongly and rapidly in recent years . but in the most eagerly anticipated section of its final statement here , the g7 stressed that " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth . " " in emerging markets with large and growing current account surpluses , especially china , it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur , " it continued . china 's key trading partners , notably the united states , have long called on beijing to allow its currency , the rmb or yuan , to float more freely on exchange markets .
european and us officials contend that an undervalued yuan gives chinese exports an unfair advantage on world markets .
eu-us divide over yen european officials at the talks in essen had been looking for action specifically on the japanese yen , which has lost 9 percent of its value against the euro since april and is seen as a threat to euro-zone exports . but disquiet in the euro zone is not shared in the united states , where us officials contend that the value of the yen reflects japanese economic fundamentals and is affected by legitimate market forces . the united states , therefore , appeared to lend support to japan 's resistance to any specific allusion to the yen in the final statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists from aid organizations on friday accused the g7 of doing too little against poverty and aids elsewhere the g7 offered a generally positive assessment of global economic prospects . " in our economies , performance remains favorable , " the ministers said . the united states economy was " experiencing solid activity , while adjusting to a more sustainable growth path , " the statement continued .
canada and britain " remain on a strong and balanced growth path .
the euro area is experiencing an increasingly broad-based upswing .
japan 's recovery is on track and is expected to continue . " " amid lower energy prices and moderating inflationary pressures , risks have abated , " the statement said .
call for vigilance on hedge funds on another hot button issue here the g7 called attention to hedge funds , which germany had wanted to see subjected to tighter regulation given their volatility and capacity to upset the global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrück -lrb- center -rrb- is concerned about hedge funds " given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the instruments they trade , we need to be vigilant , " the statement said . germany has repeatedly expressed concern over potential risks to financial stability from hedge funds , highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 1.1 trillion euros -rrb- in assets worldwide . berlin has long campaigned for increased transparency and even regulation of the largely uncontrolled sector .
but it has been forced to scale back its ambitions in face of skepticism in the united states and britain , where most of the funds are based . in its final communique , the g7 said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . " " nevertheless , the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " it said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lobbies for russia and china to join g7 prospects for russian and chinese membership in the group of seven brightened as germany voiced support for the eventual admission of the two emerging market powerhouses to the world 's richest club .

" it does n't make sense for russia not to be a full member , " steinbrück said . political motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian finance minister alexei kudrin wants russia to join the world 's richest club russia does join the members of the g7 - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - to form the group of eight for annual summits on political and broad economic matters .
but moscow has yet to make it into the group of seven , which focuses exclusively on financial issues such as global growth , exchange rates , trade and oil prices . " there are evidently political motives that stand in the way of our full membership of the g8 finance group , " kudrin told germany 's daily die welt newspaper .
" russia successfully pursued its economic growth strategy last year and i believe that as finance ministers we are ready to meet in full g8 format . " surpassing italy and france russia 's absence from group of seven finance deliberations has been attributed to the relatively small size of its economy when compared to current g7 members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees itself as an energy superpower but kudrin , addressing the press in moscow on thursday , said the russian economy had surpassed that of italy last year and should eclipse france in 2009 .

" i think we should also have them at the table . " there 's no formalized process as yet .
but my personal opinion is that in two , three , four years , we 'll no longer have the g7-g8 , but a g10 or a g14 , " he said . steinbrück pointed out that " it is practically already the case " that a number of emerging countries participate in the talks . in addition to russia , five other non-g7 states are here this weekend as guests , china , brazil , india , mexico and south africa . a question of principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody is convinced that china should join the g7 steinbrück 's enthusiasm for china 's inclusion appeared to stand in contrast to a position by german chancellor angela merkel , who at a group of eight summit in saint petersburg last july suggested that now is not the time to consider beijing 's admission . " the g8 groups countries that play a certain role in the world economy and that observe a certain number of principles , such as intellectual property rights , and for the moment i see no need to change that , " she said at the time . china is routinely accused by its trading partners of not taking sufficiently robust action against counterfeited goods . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off a two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

"
the g7 - britain , france , canada , germany , italy , japan and the united states - in addition appealed for " vigilance " on hedge funds , a trillion-dollar industry that has grown strongly and rapidly in recent years . but in the most eagerly anticipated section of its final statement here , the g7 stressed that " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth . " " in emerging markets with large and growing current account surpluses , especially china , it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur , " it continued . china 's key trading partners , notably the united states , have long called on beijing to allow its currency , the rmb or yuan , to float more freely on exchange markets .
european and us officials contend that an undervalued yuan gives chinese exports an unfair advantage on world markets .
eu-us divide over yen european officials at the talks in essen had been looking for action specifically on the japanese yen , which has lost 9 percent of its value against the euro since april and is seen as a threat to euro-zone exports . but disquiet in the euro zone is not shared in the united states , where us officials contend that the value of the yen reflects japanese economic fundamentals and is affected by legitimate market forces . the united states , therefore , appeared to lend support to japan 's resistance to any specific allusion to the yen in the final statement .

the euro area is experiencing an increasingly broad-based upswing .
japan 's recovery is on track and is expected to continue . " " amid lower energy prices and moderating inflationary pressures , risks have abated , " the statement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 10.02.2007 dutch benefit from relaxed rules on cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch example suggests the occasional spliff does not end in reefer madness the netherlands are reaping rewards from their liberal attitude toward marijuana and hashish consumption in the country 's coffee shops .
the dutch are relatively immune to the lure of hard drugs . " we have lots of young customers who travel via interrail pass , " said steve , a coffee shop owner in the dutch capital amsterdam .
" sometimes they have n't gotten enough sleep and have n't had enough to eat .
if they then smoke a joint or have a space cake -lrb- a hash cookie -rrb- , they might get nauseous .
but that 's it . " coffee shops are legal grey areas in the netherlands .
technically the consumption of soft drugs is still against the law there .
but marijuana and hashish usage are tolerated as long as the coffee shops do n't admit minors , agree to prevent the sale of hard drugs and do n't get on their neighbors ' nerves . cannabis instead of crack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee shops attract large numbers of tourists dutch drugs expert gijs van brussel said the tolerance policy keeps pot smokers away from harder , more addictive substances . " hashish is the first drug people experiment with , " van brussel said .
" when people turn 18 and enter late puberty , it 's sex and drugs and rock 'n'roll . " people at that age are unlikely to listen to warnings from their parents , he added . " their first drug is cannabis , " he said .
" if they then come into contact with heroin or cocaine , the chance is greater that they 'll experiment with those drugs as well . " the netherlands make a clear distinction between hard and soft drugs , and the number of dutch addicts has remained constant at around 25,000 .
holland has around 42 drug-related deaths annually - relatively few compared with other eu countries . the dutch view addicts as medical , not criminal cases .
those addicted to harder drugs are treated in the dutch health-care system and have access to free needle replacement and methadone programs . the grass is greener on the other side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marijuana can also be prescribed by doctors for medicinal purposes and the availability of cannabis has not turned the dutch into a country of befuddled stoners , either .
far greater amounts of soft drugs are consumed in england and france - perhaps because the illicit thrill of lighting up a joint is gone , when it 's more-or-less legal . but the netherlands ' liberal policy has created some problems on along its borders with belgium and germany .
hordes of foreign tourists descend on dutch border towns every day in search of a bag of acapulco gold or panama red . despite german and belgian protests , the mayor of the town of venlo allowed a drive-through coffee shop to open on the first highway exit .
local governments in other cities like maastricht would like to follow suit but have held off - for fear of getting on their neighbors ' nerves . kerstin schweighöfer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illicit drug use on the rise in europe as prices for illicit drugs keep dropping , juvenile drug use in some european countries is on the rise , in spite of record levels of seizures .
afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts .
-lrb- 24.11.2006 -rrb- soft drugs with hard consequences cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in germany .
but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 10.02.2007 putin slams us for making world more dangerous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin rebuffed all criticism of russia russian president vladimir putin launched a full-frontal attack on the united states on saturday , saying it had made the world a more dangerous place and left successive conflicts unresolved . addressing an audience of senior officials and politicians including many from the united states and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , putin said the united states had " overstepped " its borders with disastrous results . the russian leader , who spearheaded opposition to the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states and its allies , accused washington of operating by " separate norms . " " the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres - economic , political and humanitarian and has imposed itself on other states , " he told delegates at the 43rd munich conference on security policy . " one-sided illegitimate action has n't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies , a source of tension , " putin said .
" local and regional wars did n't get fewer .
the number of people who died did n't get less but increased significantly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense minister gates will likely respond to putin when he speaks at munich the united states , he said , had gone " from one conflict to another without achieving a fully-fledged solution to any of them . " putin also took aim at us plans to site a missile defense system close to russia 's border in nato countries the czech republic and poland , adding that any further enlargement of the alliance would be inappropriate . " why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the threat ?
terrorism and fighting it , " putin said . analysts say that russia 's relations with the united states have deteriorated significantly under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
criticism from us delegates , human rights watch his speech got a frosty reception from us delegates in a question and answer session that followed his speech at this traditionally pro-western forum . us democratic congresswoman jane harmen charged that russian experts had helped iran develop an indigenous missile capability in the 1990s . putin denied that claim , saying russia was " less involved than anyone " in such technology transfers . he also rebuffed criticism of his country 's human rights record by the head of the new york-based human rights watch , kenneth roth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth is the first human rights activist to be invited to the munich security conference roth said the world was seeing an " increasingly uni-polar government in russia , where competing centres of influence are being forced to toe the party line . " putin responded that russia was taking steps to stop foreign governments clandestinely using russian non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- to influence russian policy . on the subject of numerous killings of russian journalists during his presidency , putin turned the question back to the united states , saying that it was in iraq that most journalists were killed doing their job . putin 's comments were likely to be countered by subsequent speakers at the munich conference , whose traditional theme is the future of nato .
not least among these is to be us defense secretary robert gates , who was due to make his first major speech since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

" " the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres - economic , political and humanitarian and has imposed itself on other states , " he told delegates at the 43rd munich conference on security policy . " one-sided illegitimate action has n't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies , a source of tension , " putin said .
" local and regional wars did n't get fewer .
the number of people who died did n't get less but increased significantly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense minister gates will likely respond to putin when he speaks at munich the united states , he said , had gone " from one conflict to another without achieving a fully-fledged solution to any of them . " putin also took aim at us plans to site a missile defense system close to russia 's border in nato countries the czech republic and poland , adding that any further enlargement of the alliance would be inappropriate . " why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the threat ?
terrorism and fighting it , " putin said . analysts say that russia 's relations with the united states have deteriorated significantly under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
criticism from us delegates , human rights watch his speech got a frosty reception from us delegates in a question and answer session that followed his speech at this traditionally pro-western forum . us democratic congresswoman jane harmen charged that russian experts had helped iran develop an indigenous missile capability in the 1990s . putin denied that claim , saying russia was " less involved than anyone " in such technology transfers . he also rebuffed criticism of his country 's human rights record by the head of the new york-based human rights watch , kenneth roth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth is the first human rights activist to be invited to the munich security conference roth said the world was seeing an " increasingly uni-polar government in russia , where competing centres of influence are being forced to toe the party line . " putin responded that russia was taking steps to stop foreign governments clandestinely using russian non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- to influence russian policy . on the subject of numerous killings of russian journalists during his presidency , putin turned the question back to the united states , saying that it was in iraq that most journalists were killed doing their job . putin 's comments were likely to be countered by subsequent speakers at the munich conference , whose traditional theme is the future of nato .

" " the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres - economic , political and humanitarian and has imposed itself on other states , " he told delegates at the 43rd munich conference on security policy . " one-sided illegitimate action has n't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies , a source of tension , " putin said .
" local and regional wars did n't get fewer .
the number of people who died did n't get less but increased significantly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense minister gates will likely respond to putin when he speaks at munich the united states , he said , had gone " from one conflict to another without achieving a fully-fledged solution to any of them . " putin also took aim at us plans to site a missile defense system close to russia 's border in nato countries the czech republic and poland , adding that any further enlargement of the alliance would be inappropriate . " why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the threat ?
terrorism and fighting it , " putin said . analysts say that russia 's relations with the united states have deteriorated significantly under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
criticism from us delegates , human rights watch his speech got a frosty reception from us delegates in a question and answer session that followed his speech at this traditionally pro-western forum . us democratic congresswoman jane harmen charged that russian experts had helped iran develop an indigenous missile capability in the 1990s . putin denied that claim , saying russia was " less involved than anyone " in such technology transfers . he also rebuffed criticism of his country 's human rights record by the head of the new york-based human rights watch , kenneth roth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth is the first human rights activist to be invited to the munich security conference roth said the world was seeing an " increasingly uni-polar government in russia , where competing centres of influence are being forced to toe the party line . " putin responded that russia was taking steps to stop foreign governments clandestinely using russian non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- to influence russian policy . on the subject of numerous killings of russian journalists during his presidency , putin turned the question back to the united states , saying that it was in iraq that most journalists were killed doing their job . putin 's comments were likely to be countered by subsequent speakers at the munich conference , whose traditional theme is the future of nato .
not least among these is to be us defense secretary robert gates , who was due to make his first major speech since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 10.02.2007 dutch benefit from relaxed rules on cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch example suggests the occasional spliff does not end in reefer madness the netherlands are reaping rewards from their liberal attitude toward marijuana and hashish consumption in the country 's coffee shops .
the dutch are relatively immune to the lure of hard drugs . " we have lots of young customers who travel via interrail pass , " said steve , a coffee shop owner in the dutch capital amsterdam .
" sometimes they have n't gotten enough sleep and have n't had enough to eat .
if they then smoke a joint or have a space cake -lrb- a hash cookie -rrb- , they might get nauseous .
but that 's it . " coffee shops are legal grey areas in the netherlands .
technically the consumption of soft drugs is still against the law there .
but marijuana and hashish usage are tolerated as long as the coffee shops do n't admit minors , agree to prevent the sale of hard drugs and do n't get on their neighbors ' nerves . cannabis instead of crack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee shops attract large numbers of tourists dutch drugs expert gijs van brussel said the tolerance policy keeps pot smokers away from harder , more addictive substances . " hashish is the first drug people experiment with , " van brussel said .
" when people turn 18 and enter late puberty , it 's sex and drugs and rock 'n'roll . " people at that age are unlikely to listen to warnings from their parents , he added . " their first drug is cannabis , " he said .
" if they then come into contact with heroin or cocaine , the chance is greater that they 'll experiment with those drugs as well . " the netherlands make a clear distinction between hard and soft drugs , and the number of dutch addicts has remained constant at around 25,000 .
holland has around 42 drug-related deaths annually - relatively few compared with other eu countries . the dutch view addicts as medical , not criminal cases .
those addicted to harder drugs are treated in the dutch health-care system and have access to free needle replacement and methadone programs . the grass is greener on the other side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marijuana can also be prescribed by doctors for medicinal purposes and the availability of cannabis has not turned the dutch into a country of befuddled stoners , either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 10.02.2007 putin slams us for making world more dangerous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin rebuffed all criticism of russia russian president vladimir putin launched a full-frontal attack on the united states on saturday , saying it had made the world a more dangerous place and left successive conflicts unresolved . addressing an audience of senior officials and politicians including many from the united states and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , putin said the united states had " overstepped " its borders with disastrous results . the russian leader , who spearheaded opposition to the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states and its allies , accused washington of operating by " separate norms . " " the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres - economic , political and humanitarian and has imposed itself on other states , " he told delegates at the 43rd munich conference on security policy . " one-sided illegitimate action has n't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies , a source of tension , " putin said .
" local and regional wars did n't get fewer .
the number of people who died did n't get less but increased significantly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense minister gates will likely respond to putin when he speaks at munich the united states , he said , had gone " from one conflict to another without achieving a fully-fledged solution to any of them . " putin also took aim at us plans to site a missile defense system close to russia 's border in nato countries the czech republic and poland , adding that any further enlargement of the alliance would be inappropriate . " why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the threat ?
terrorism and fighting it , " putin said . analysts say that russia 's relations with the united states have deteriorated significantly under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
criticism from us delegates , human rights watch his speech got a frosty reception from us delegates in a question and answer session that followed his speech at this traditionally pro-western forum . us democratic congresswoman jane harmen charged that russian experts had helped iran develop an indigenous missile capability in the 1990s . putin denied that claim , saying russia was " less involved than anyone " in such technology transfers . he also rebuffed criticism of his country 's human rights record by the head of the new york-based human rights watch , kenneth roth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth is the first human rights activist to be invited to the munich security conference roth said the world was seeing an " increasingly uni-polar government in russia , where competing centres of influence are being forced to toe the party line . " putin responded that russia was taking steps to stop foreign governments clandestinely using russian non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- to influence russian policy . on the subject of numerous killings of russian journalists during his presidency , putin turned the question back to the united states , saying that it was in iraq that most journalists were killed doing their job . putin 's comments were likely to be countered by subsequent speakers at the munich conference , whose traditional theme is the future of nato .
not least among these is to be us defense secretary robert gates , who was due to make his first major speech since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks . " -lrb- 10.02.2007 -rrb- germany lobbies for russia and china to join g7 prospects for russian and chinese membership in the group of seven brightened as germany voiced support for the eventual admission of the two emerging market powerhouses to the world 's richest club .

" it does n't make sense for russia not to be a full member , " steinbrück said . political motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian finance minister alexei kudrin wants russia to join the world 's richest club russia does join the members of the g7 - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - to form the group of eight for annual summits on political and broad economic matters .
but moscow has yet to make it into the group of seven , which focuses exclusively on financial issues such as global growth , exchange rates , trade and oil prices . " there are evidently political motives that stand in the way of our full membership of the g8 finance group , " kudrin told germany 's daily die welt newspaper .
" russia successfully pursued its economic growth strategy last year and i believe that as finance ministers we are ready to meet in full g8 format . " surpassing italy and france russia 's absence from group of seven finance deliberations has been attributed to the relatively small size of its economy when compared to current g7 members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees itself as an energy superpower but kudrin , addressing the press in moscow on thursday , said the russian economy had surpassed that of italy last year and should eclipse france in 2009 . " we are a real economy , which attracts investment and has a good pace of development , " he said . with the ruble now fully convertible , russia last year received inward capital flows amounting to $ 41.5 billion -lrb- 31.9 billion euros -rrb- , according to kudrin . expanding makes sense according to germany 's finance minister , expanding the g7 block would be a logical step to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators at the g7 meeting asked for greater spending on poverty and aids " there are so many issues where it simply does n't make sense not to discuss them without important emerging countries like china , india , south africa , brazil and australia to name but a few , " steinbrück said .
" i think we should also have them at the table . " there 's no formalized process as yet .
but my personal opinion is that in two , three , four years , we 'll no longer have the g7-g8 , but a g10 or a g14 , " he said . steinbrück pointed out that " it is practically already the case " that a number of emerging countries participate in the talks . in addition to russia , five other non-g7 states are here this weekend as guests , china , brazil , india , mexico and south africa . a question of principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody is convinced that china should join the g7 steinbrück 's enthusiasm for china 's inclusion appeared to stand in contrast to a position by german chancellor angela merkel , who at a group of eight summit in saint petersburg last july suggested that now is not the time to consider beijing 's admission . " the g8 groups countries that play a certain role in the world economy and that observe a certain number of principles , such as intellectual property rights , and for the moment i see no need to change that , " she said at the time . china is routinely accused by its trading partners of not taking sufficiently robust action against counterfeited goods . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off a two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

" it does n't make sense for russia not to be a full member , " steinbrück said . political motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian finance minister alexei kudrin wants russia to join the world 's richest club russia does join the members of the g7 - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - to form the group of eight for annual summits on political and broad economic matters .
but moscow has yet to make it into the group of seven , which focuses exclusively on financial issues such as global growth , exchange rates , trade and oil prices . " there are evidently political motives that stand in the way of our full membership of the g8 finance group , " kudrin told germany 's daily die welt newspaper .
" russia successfully pursued its economic growth strategy last year and i believe that as finance ministers we are ready to meet in full g8 format . " surpassing italy and france russia 's absence from group of seven finance deliberations has been attributed to the relatively small size of its economy when compared to current g7 members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees itself as an energy superpower but kudrin , addressing the press in moscow on thursday , said the russian economy had surpassed that of italy last year and should eclipse france in 2009 . " we are a real economy , which attracts investment and has a good pace of development , " he said . with the ruble now fully convertible , russia last year received inward capital flows amounting to $ 41.5 billion -lrb- 31.9 billion euros -rrb- , according to kudrin . expanding makes sense according to germany 's finance minister , expanding the g7 block would be a logical step to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators at the g7 meeting asked for greater spending on poverty and aids " there are so many issues where it simply does n't make sense not to discuss them without important emerging countries like china , india , south africa , brazil and australia to name but a few , " steinbrück said .
" i think we should also have them at the table . " there 's no formalized process as yet .
but my personal opinion is that in two , three , four years , we 'll no longer have the g7-g8 , but a g10 or a g14 , " he said . steinbrück pointed out that " it is practically already the case " that a number of emerging countries participate in the talks . in addition to russia , five other non-g7 states are here this weekend as guests , china , brazil , india , mexico and south africa . a question of principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody is convinced that china should join the g7 steinbrück 's enthusiasm for china 's inclusion appeared to stand in contrast to a position by german chancellor angela merkel , who at a group of eight summit in saint petersburg last july suggested that now is not the time to consider beijing 's admission . " the g8 groups countries that play a certain role in the world economy and that observe a certain number of principles , such as intellectual property rights , and for the moment i see no need to change that , " she said at the time . china is routinely accused by its trading partners of not taking sufficiently robust action against counterfeited goods . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off a two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

" " the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres - economic , political and humanitarian and has imposed itself on other states , " he told delegates at the 43rd munich conference on security policy . " one-sided illegitimate action has n't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies , a source of tension , " putin said .
" local and regional wars did n't get fewer .
the number of people who died did n't get less but increased significantly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense minister gates will likely respond to putin when he speaks at munich the united states , he said , had gone " from one conflict to another without achieving a fully-fledged solution to any of them . " putin also took aim at us plans to site a missile defense system close to russia 's border in nato countries the czech republic and poland , adding that any further enlargement of the alliance would be inappropriate . " why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the threat ?
terrorism and fighting it , " putin said . analysts say that russia 's relations with the united states have deteriorated significantly under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
criticism from us delegates , human rights watch his speech got a frosty reception from us delegates in a question and answer session that followed his speech at this traditionally pro-western forum . us democratic congresswoman jane harmen charged that russian experts had helped iran develop an indigenous missile capability in the 1990s . putin denied that claim , saying russia was " less involved than anyone " in such technology transfers . he also rebuffed criticism of his country 's human rights record by the head of the new york-based human rights watch , kenneth roth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth is the first human rights activist to be invited to the munich security conference roth said the world was seeing an " increasingly uni-polar government in russia , where competing centres of influence are being forced to toe the party line . " putin responded that russia was taking steps to stop foreign governments clandestinely using russian non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- to influence russian policy . on the subject of numerous killings of russian journalists during his presidency , putin turned the question back to the united states , saying that it was in iraq that most journalists were killed doing their job . putin 's comments were likely to be countered by subsequent speakers at the munich conference , whose traditional theme is the future of nato .

"
the g7 - britain , france , canada , germany , italy , japan and the united states - in addition appealed for " vigilance " on hedge funds , a trillion-dollar industry that has grown strongly and rapidly in recent years . but in the most eagerly anticipated section of its final statement here , the g7 stressed that " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth . " " in emerging markets with large and growing current account surpluses , especially china , it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur , " it continued . china 's key trading partners , notably the united states , have long called on beijing to allow its currency , the rmb or yuan , to float more freely on exchange markets .
european and us officials contend that an undervalued yuan gives chinese exports an unfair advantage on world markets .
eu-us divide over yen european officials at the talks in essen had been looking for action specifically on the japanese yen , which has lost 9 percent of its value against the euro since april and is seen as a threat to euro-zone exports . but disquiet in the euro zone is not shared in the united states , where us officials contend that the value of the yen reflects japanese economic fundamentals and is affected by legitimate market forces . the united states , therefore , appeared to lend support to japan 's resistance to any specific allusion to the yen in the final statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists from aid organizations on friday accused the g7 of doing too little against poverty and aids elsewhere the g7 offered a generally positive assessment of global economic prospects . " in our economies , performance remains favorable , " the ministers said . the united states economy was " experiencing solid activity , while adjusting to a more sustainable growth path , " the statement continued .
canada and britain " remain on a strong and balanced growth path .
the euro area is experiencing an increasingly broad-based upswing .
japan 's recovery is on track and is expected to continue . " " amid lower energy prices and moderating inflationary pressures , risks have abated , " the statement said .
call for vigilance on hedge funds on another hot button issue here the g7 called attention to hedge funds , which germany had wanted to see subjected to tighter regulation given their volatility and capacity to upset the global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrück -lrb- center -rrb- is concerned about hedge funds " given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the instruments they trade , we need to be vigilant , " the statement said . germany has repeatedly expressed concern over potential risks to financial stability from hedge funds , highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 1.1 trillion euros -rrb- in assets worldwide . berlin has long campaigned for increased transparency and even regulation of the largely uncontrolled sector .
but it has been forced to scale back its ambitions in face of skepticism in the united states and britain , where most of the funds are based . in its final communique , the g7 said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . " " nevertheless , the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " it said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lobbies for russia and china to join g7 prospects for russian and chinese membership in the group of seven brightened as germany voiced support for the eventual admission of the two emerging market powerhouses to the world 's richest club .
-lrb- 10.02.2007 -rrb- major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

" it does n't make sense for russia not to be a full member , " steinbrück said . political motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian finance minister alexei kudrin wants russia to join the world 's richest club russia does join the members of the g7 - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - to form the group of eight for annual summits on political and broad economic matters .
but moscow has yet to make it into the group of seven , which focuses exclusively on financial issues such as global growth , exchange rates , trade and oil prices . " there are evidently political motives that stand in the way of our full membership of the g8 finance group , " kudrin told germany 's daily die welt newspaper .
" russia successfully pursued its economic growth strategy last year and i believe that as finance ministers we are ready to meet in full g8 format . " surpassing italy and france russia 's absence from group of seven finance deliberations has been attributed to the relatively small size of its economy when compared to current g7 members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees itself as an energy superpower but kudrin , addressing the press in moscow on thursday , said the russian economy had surpassed that of italy last year and should eclipse france in 2009 . " we are a real economy , which attracts investment and has a good pace of development , " he said . with the ruble now fully convertible , russia last year received inward capital flows amounting to $ 41.5 billion -lrb- 31.9 billion euros -rrb- , according to kudrin . expanding makes sense according to germany 's finance minister , expanding the g7 block would be a logical step to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators at the g7 meeting asked for greater spending on poverty and aids " there are so many issues where it simply does n't make sense not to discuss them without important emerging countries like china , india , south africa , brazil and australia to name but a few , " steinbrück said .
" i think we should also have them at the table . " there 's no formalized process as yet .
but my personal opinion is that in two , three , four years , we 'll no longer have the g7-g8 , but a g10 or a g14 , " he said . steinbrück pointed out that " it is practically already the case " that a number of emerging countries participate in the talks . in addition to russia , five other non-g7 states are here this weekend as guests , china , brazil , india , mexico and south africa . a question of principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody is convinced that china should join the g7 steinbrück 's enthusiasm for china 's inclusion appeared to stand in contrast to a position by german chancellor angela merkel , who at a group of eight summit in saint petersburg last july suggested that now is not the time to consider beijing 's admission . " the g8 groups countries that play a certain role in the world economy and that observe a certain number of principles , such as intellectual property rights , and for the moment i see no need to change that , " she said at the time . china is routinely accused by its trading partners of not taking sufficiently robust action against counterfeited goods . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off a two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

" " the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres - economic , political and humanitarian and has imposed itself on other states , " he told delegates at the 43rd munich conference on security policy . " one-sided illegitimate action has n't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies , a source of tension , " putin said .
" local and regional wars did n't get fewer .
the number of people who died did n't get less but increased significantly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense minister gates will likely respond to putin when he speaks at munich the united states , he said , had gone " from one conflict to another without achieving a fully-fledged solution to any of them . " putin also took aim at us plans to site a missile defense system close to russia 's border in nato countries the czech republic and poland , adding that any further enlargement of the alliance would be inappropriate . " why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the threat ?
terrorism and fighting it , " putin said . analysts say that russia 's relations with the united states have deteriorated significantly under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
criticism from us delegates , human rights watch his speech got a frosty reception from us delegates in a question and answer session that followed his speech at this traditionally pro-western forum . us democratic congresswoman jane harmen charged that russian experts had helped iran develop an indigenous missile capability in the 1990s . putin denied that claim , saying russia was " less involved than anyone " in such technology transfers . he also rebuffed criticism of his country 's human rights record by the head of the new york-based human rights watch , kenneth roth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth is the first human rights activist to be invited to the munich security conference roth said the world was seeing an " increasingly uni-polar government in russia , where competing centres of influence are being forced to toe the party line . " putin responded that russia was taking steps to stop foreign governments clandestinely using russian non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- to influence russian policy . on the subject of numerous killings of russian journalists during his presidency , putin turned the question back to the united states , saying that it was in iraq that most journalists were killed doing their job . putin 's comments were likely to be countered by subsequent speakers at the munich conference , whose traditional theme is the future of nato .

" it does n't make sense for russia not to be a full member , " steinbrück said . political motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian finance minister alexei kudrin wants russia to join the world 's richest club russia does join the members of the g7 - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - to form the group of eight for annual summits on political and broad economic matters .
but moscow has yet to make it into the group of seven , which focuses exclusively on financial issues such as global growth , exchange rates , trade and oil prices . " there are evidently political motives that stand in the way of our full membership of the g8 finance group , " kudrin told germany 's daily die welt newspaper .
" russia successfully pursued its economic growth strategy last year and i believe that as finance ministers we are ready to meet in full g8 format . " surpassing italy and france russia 's absence from group of seven finance deliberations has been attributed to the relatively small size of its economy when compared to current g7 members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees itself as an energy superpower but kudrin , addressing the press in moscow on thursday , said the russian economy had surpassed that of italy last year and should eclipse france in 2009 . " we are a real economy , which attracts investment and has a good pace of development , " he said . with the ruble now fully convertible , russia last year received inward capital flows amounting to $ 41.5 billion -lrb- 31.9 billion euros -rrb- , according to kudrin . expanding makes sense according to germany 's finance minister , expanding the g7 block would be a logical step to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators at the g7 meeting asked for greater spending on poverty and aids " there are so many issues where it simply does n't make sense not to discuss them without important emerging countries like china , india , south africa , brazil and australia to name but a few , " steinbrück said .
" i think we should also have them at the table . " there 's no formalized process as yet .
but my personal opinion is that in two , three , four years , we 'll no longer have the g7-g8 , but a g10 or a g14 , " he said . steinbrück pointed out that " it is practically already the case " that a number of emerging countries participate in the talks . in addition to russia , five other non-g7 states are here this weekend as guests , china , brazil , india , mexico and south africa . a question of principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody is convinced that china should join the g7 steinbrück 's enthusiasm for china 's inclusion appeared to stand in contrast to a position by german chancellor angela merkel , who at a group of eight summit in saint petersburg last july suggested that now is not the time to consider beijing 's admission . " the g8 groups countries that play a certain role in the world economy and that observe a certain number of principles , such as intellectual property rights , and for the moment i see no need to change that , " she said at the time . china is routinely accused by its trading partners of not taking sufficiently robust action against counterfeited goods . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off a two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

" it does n't make sense for russia not to be a full member , " steinbrück said . political motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian finance minister alexei kudrin wants russia to join the world 's richest club russia does join the members of the g7 - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - to form the group of eight for annual summits on political and broad economic matters .
but moscow has yet to make it into the group of seven , which focuses exclusively on financial issues such as global growth , exchange rates , trade and oil prices . " there are evidently political motives that stand in the way of our full membership of the g8 finance group , " kudrin told germany 's daily die welt newspaper .
" russia successfully pursued its economic growth strategy last year and i believe that as finance ministers we are ready to meet in full g8 format . " surpassing italy and france russia 's absence from group of seven finance deliberations has been attributed to the relatively small size of its economy when compared to current g7 members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees itself as an energy superpower but kudrin , addressing the press in moscow on thursday , said the russian economy had surpassed that of italy last year and should eclipse france in 2009 . " we are a real economy , which attracts investment and has a good pace of development , " he said . with the ruble now fully convertible , russia last year received inward capital flows amounting to $ 41.5 billion -lrb- 31.9 billion euros -rrb- , according to kudrin . expanding makes sense according to germany 's finance minister , expanding the g7 block would be a logical step to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators at the g7 meeting asked for greater spending on poverty and aids " there are so many issues where it simply does n't make sense not to discuss them without important emerging countries like china , india , south africa , brazil and australia to name but a few , " steinbrück said .
" i think we should also have them at the table . " there 's no formalized process as yet .
but my personal opinion is that in two , three , four years , we 'll no longer have the g7-g8 , but a g10 or a g14 , " he said . steinbrück pointed out that " it is practically already the case " that a number of emerging countries participate in the talks . in addition to russia , five other non-g7 states are here this weekend as guests , china , brazil , india , mexico and south africa . a question of principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody is convinced that china should join the g7 steinbrück 's enthusiasm for china 's inclusion appeared to stand in contrast to a position by german chancellor angela merkel , who at a group of eight summit in saint petersburg last july suggested that now is not the time to consider beijing 's admission . " the g8 groups countries that play a certain role in the world economy and that observe a certain number of principles , such as intellectual property rights , and for the moment i see no need to change that , " she said at the time . china is routinely accused by its trading partners of not taking sufficiently robust action against counterfeited goods . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off a two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

the g7 - britain , france , canada , germany , italy , japan and the united states - in addition appealed for " vigilance " on hedge funds , a trillion-dollar industry that has grown strongly and rapidly in recent years . but in the most eagerly anticipated section of its final statement here , the g7 stressed that " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth . " " in emerging markets with large and growing current account surpluses , especially china , it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur , " it continued . china 's key trading partners , notably the united states , have long called on beijing to allow its currency , the rmb or yuan , to float more freely on exchange markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 10.02.2007 dutch benefit from relaxed rules on cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch example suggests the occasional spliff does not end in reefer madness the netherlands are reaping rewards from their liberal attitude toward marijuana and hashish consumption in the country 's coffee shops .
the dutch are relatively immune to the lure of hard drugs . " we have lots of young customers who travel via interrail pass , " said steve , a coffee shop owner in the dutch capital amsterdam .
" sometimes they have n't gotten enough sleep and have n't had enough to eat .
if they then smoke a joint or have a space cake -lrb- a hash cookie -rrb- , they might get nauseous .
but that 's it . " coffee shops are legal grey areas in the netherlands .
technically the consumption of soft drugs is still against the law there .
but marijuana and hashish usage are tolerated as long as the coffee shops do n't admit minors , agree to prevent the sale of hard drugs and do n't get on their neighbors ' nerves . cannabis instead of crack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee shops attract large numbers of tourists dutch drugs expert gijs van brussel said the tolerance policy keeps pot smokers away from harder , more addictive substances . " hashish is the first drug people experiment with , " van brussel said .
" when people turn 18 and enter late puberty , it 's sex and drugs and rock 'n'roll . " people at that age are unlikely to listen to warnings from their parents , he added . " their first drug is cannabis , " he said .
" if they then come into contact with heroin or cocaine , the chance is greater that they 'll experiment with those drugs as well . " the netherlands make a clear distinction between hard and soft drugs , and the number of dutch addicts has remained constant at around 25,000 .
holland has around 42 drug-related deaths annually - relatively few compared with other eu countries . the dutch view addicts as medical , not criminal cases .
those addicted to harder drugs are treated in the dutch health-care system and have access to free needle replacement and methadone programs . the grass is greener on the other side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marijuana can also be prescribed by doctors for medicinal purposes and the availability of cannabis has not turned the dutch into a country of befuddled stoners , either .
far greater amounts of soft drugs are consumed in england and france - perhaps because the illicit thrill of lighting up a joint is gone , when it 's more-or-less legal . but the netherlands ' liberal policy has created some problems on along its borders with belgium and germany .
hordes of foreign tourists descend on dutch border towns every day in search of a bag of acapulco gold or panama red . despite german and belgian protests , the mayor of the town of venlo allowed a drive-through coffee shop to open on the first highway exit .
local governments in other cities like maastricht would like to follow suit but have held off - for fear of getting on their neighbors ' nerves . kerstin schweighöfer -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illicit drug use on the rise in europe as prices for illicit drugs keep dropping , juvenile drug use in some european countries is on the rise , in spite of record levels of seizures .

-lrb- 24.11.2006 -rrb- soft drugs with hard consequences cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in germany .
but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age .

" " the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres - economic , political and humanitarian and has imposed itself on other states , " he told delegates at the 43rd munich conference on security policy .

the dutch are relatively immune to the lure of hard drugs . " we have lots of young customers who travel via interrail pass , " said steve , a coffee shop owner in the dutch capital amsterdam .
" sometimes they have n't gotten enough sleep and have n't had enough to eat .
if they then smoke a joint or have a space cake -lrb- a hash cookie -rrb- , they might get nauseous .
but that 's it . " coffee shops are legal grey areas in the netherlands .
technically the consumption of soft drugs is still against the law there .
but marijuana and hashish usage are tolerated as long as the coffee shops do n't admit minors , agree to prevent the sale of hard drugs and do n't get on their neighbors ' nerves . cannabis instead of crack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee shops attract large numbers of tourists dutch drugs expert gijs van brussel said the tolerance policy keeps pot smokers away from harder , more addictive substances .

"
the g7 - britain , france , canada , germany , italy , japan and the united states - in addition appealed for " vigilance " on hedge funds , a trillion-dollar industry that has grown strongly and rapidly in recent years . but in the most eagerly anticipated section of its final statement here , the g7 stressed that " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth . " " in emerging markets with large and growing current account surpluses , especially china , it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur , " it continued . china 's key trading partners , notably the united states , have long called on beijing to allow its currency , the rmb or yuan , to float more freely on exchange markets .
european and us officials contend that an undervalued yuan gives chinese exports an unfair advantage on world markets .
eu-us divide over yen european officials at the talks in essen had been looking for action specifically on the japanese yen , which has lost 9 percent of its value against the euro since april and is seen as a threat to euro-zone exports . but disquiet in the euro zone is not shared in the united states , where us officials contend that the value of the yen reflects japanese economic fundamentals and is affected by legitimate market forces . the united states , therefore , appeared to lend support to japan 's resistance to any specific allusion to the yen in the final statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists from aid organizations on friday accused the g7 of doing too little against poverty and aids elsewhere the g7 offered a generally positive assessment of global economic prospects . " in our economies , performance remains favorable , " the ministers said . the united states economy was " experiencing solid activity , while adjusting to a more sustainable growth path , " the statement continued .
canada and britain " remain on a strong and balanced growth path .
the euro area is experiencing an increasingly broad-based upswing .
japan 's recovery is on track and is expected to continue . " " amid lower energy prices and moderating inflationary pressures , risks have abated , " the statement said .
call for vigilance on hedge funds on another hot button issue here the g7 called attention to hedge funds , which germany had wanted to see subjected to tighter regulation given their volatility and capacity to upset the global financial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrück -lrb- center -rrb- is concerned about hedge funds " given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the instruments they trade , we need to be vigilant , " the statement said . germany has repeatedly expressed concern over potential risks to financial stability from hedge funds , highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 1.1 trillion euros -rrb- in assets worldwide . berlin has long campaigned for increased transparency and even regulation of the largely uncontrolled sector .
but it has been forced to scale back its ambitions in face of skepticism in the united states and britain , where most of the funds are based . in its final communique , the g7 said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . " " nevertheless , the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " it said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany lobbies for russia and china to join g7 prospects for russian and chinese membership in the group of seven brightened as germany voiced support for the eventual admission of the two emerging market powerhouses to the world 's richest club .

" it does n't make sense for russia not to be a full member , " steinbrück said . political motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian finance minister alexei kudrin wants russia to join the world 's richest club russia does join the members of the g7 - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - to form the group of eight for annual summits on political and broad economic matters .
but moscow has yet to make it into the group of seven , which focuses exclusively on financial issues such as global growth , exchange rates , trade and oil prices . " there are evidently political motives that stand in the way of our full membership of the g8 finance group , " kudrin told germany 's daily die welt newspaper .
" russia successfully pursued its economic growth strategy last year and i believe that as finance ministers we are ready to meet in full g8 format . " surpassing italy and france russia 's absence from group of seven finance deliberations has been attributed to the relatively small size of its economy when compared to current g7 members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees itself as an energy superpower but kudrin , addressing the press in moscow on thursday , said the russian economy had surpassed that of italy last year and should eclipse france in 2009 . " we are a real economy , which attracts investment and has a good pace of development , " he said . with the ruble now fully convertible , russia last year received inward capital flows amounting to $ 41.5 billion -lrb- 31.9 billion euros -rrb- , according to kudrin . expanding makes sense according to germany 's finance minister , expanding the g7 block would be a logical step to take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators at the g7 meeting asked for greater spending on poverty and aids " there are so many issues where it simply does n't make sense not to discuss them without important emerging countries like china , india , south africa , brazil and australia to name but a few , " steinbrück said .
" i think we should also have them at the table . " there 's no formalized process as yet .
but my personal opinion is that in two , three , four years , we 'll no longer have the g7-g8 , but a g10 or a g14 , " he said . steinbrück pointed out that " it is practically already the case " that a number of emerging countries participate in the talks . in addition to russia , five other non-g7 states are here this weekend as guests , china , brazil , india , mexico and south africa . a question of principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody is convinced that china should join the g7 steinbrück 's enthusiasm for china 's inclusion appeared to stand in contrast to a position by german chancellor angela merkel , who at a group of eight summit in saint petersburg last july suggested that now is not the time to consider beijing 's admission . " the g8 groups countries that play a certain role in the world economy and that observe a certain number of principles , such as intellectual property rights , and for the moment i see no need to change that , " she said at the time . china is routinely accused by its trading partners of not taking sufficiently robust action against counterfeited goods . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major currency conflict at g7 finance minister talks in essen g7 finance chiefs kicked off a two days of meetings in essen friday to take stock of the global economy , but tempers looked likely to fray over the contentious issue of the weakening japanese yen .

those addicted to harder drugs are treated in the dutch health-care system and have access to free needle replacement and methadone programs . the grass is greener on the other side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marijuana can also be prescribed by doctors for medicinal purposes and the availability of cannabis has not turned the dutch into a country of befuddled stoners , either .
far greater amounts of soft drugs are consumed in england and france - perhaps because the illicit thrill of lighting up a joint is gone , when it 's more-or-less legal . but the netherlands ' liberal policy has created some problems on along its borders with belgium and germany .
hordes of foreign tourists descend on dutch border towns every day in search of a bag of acapulco gold or panama red . despite german and belgian protests , the mayor of the town of venlo allowed a drive-through coffee shop to open on the first highway exit .

neath port talbot council said the glyndulais home , which currently has 15 residents with 17 beds spare , did not meet " modern standards " .
a spokeswoman denied campaigners ' claims that staff were told to " turn away " 23 potential residents in 2006 .
she said demand for places has reduced but said no decision had been taken .
news of the proposed closure of the home , which is in the dulais valley above neath , was broken to staff and residents in january and the council will meet to discuss its fate on 28 march .
my mother has been in tears and her carer is very worried about her ann seal if the closure goes ahead , it is feared the residents and staff will be moved to new facilities outside the dulais valley .
the council has work on a new care complex in caewern in neath which it said would provide sheltered housing for elderly and disabled people in the neath and dulais valley communities .
ann seal , from seven sisters , whose 92-year-old mother is a resident of the home , said moving residents and staff out of the dulais valley could cause difficulties for relatives .
" many of the residents ' families live locally as do the staff , " she said .
" if they are moved to a different facility some without transport will find it difficult to continue visiting and even continue their work as carers . "
a spokeswoman for the council said six of the 12 permanent residents in the home were from the dulais valley .
" the demand for residential care in the dulais valley has fallen and at present the home , which has capacity for 32 beds , is occupied by just 12 long term and three short term residents , " she said .
but mrs seal claimed that demand for beds at glyndulais in 2006 was high and staff at the home were told by management to turn away 23 requests for beds .
welfare she also said relatives were concerned for the welfare of the home 's elderly residents , many of whom had been living there for several years .
" all of the residents are very upset about the closure .
my mother has been in tears and her carer is very worried about her , " she said .
campaigners have the backing of welsh secretary and neath mp peter hain and local am gwenda thomas .
speaking to the neath guardian , mr hain urged neath port talbot council to look at alternative sites in the dulais valley so that residents and locally-based staff would not have far to go .
over 100 people attended a public meeting about the possible closure on 29 january .
a council spokeswoman stressed that no decision had been taken about the future of the home and that a consultation exercise would take account of the views of residents , relatives , staff , trade unions and the health and social care community .
but she said the facilities at glyndulais , which were built almost 40 years ago , did not meet " modern standards and expectations of a new generation of older people and their families " .
she added : " -lrb- they -rrb- want , rightly , the best standards of physical care in modern , up to date facilities .

researchers at cardiff university 's centre for sustainability -lrb- brass -rrb- assessed the economic and environmental impacts of the 2006 six nations clash between wales and scotland .
the economic scoreline for the welsh capital was very welcome : rugby fans spent nearly £ 15m that weekend .
and 77 % of that remained in the cardiff economy .
but the environmental results , according to the researchers , were a different matter . "
all those burgers , pies and pasties require lots of energy to make because they 're highly processed - they result in a large footprint " dr andrea collins dr andrea collins , of brass , said : " our research considered how far supporters travelled to cardiff , whether they used public transport , the amount of food and drink they consumed , overnight accommodation and how much waste was created .
" the energy and resources used by 85,499 rugby supporters that weekend resulted in an ecological footprint equivalent to the area of 3,578 rugby pitches . "
ecological footprinting is a way of showing humans ' environmental impacts .
it depicts the amount of productive land that would be needed to sustain human activities like consumption and pollution .
match eco-score match ' carbon footprint ' = 3,578 rugby pitches 47,000 burgers , pies and pasties eaten over weekend average match day drink - six pints of lager , five spirits and four more units of alcohol 67 tonnes of waste , but only 1 % recycled source : cardiff university the more land needed , the less sustainable the activity .
brass researchers say a footprint the area of 3,578 rugby pitches makes six nations matches at the millennium stadium unsustainable .
dr collins said : " for example , the types of food eaten by fans .
all those burgers , pies and pasties require lots of energy to make because they 're highly processed .
" they result in a large footprint . "
researchers found that 47,000 burgers , pies , pasties were eaten over the match weekend by fans , and no vegetarian meals or fruit was consumed .
an average supporter drank six pints of lager , five measures of spirits and another four units of other alcohol on the day of the match .
the analysis also found that the wales v scotland match produced 67 tonnes of waste , but only 1 % of it was recycled .
and to get to the game , fans travelled a staggering 15 million miles .
with the vast majority coming not by train but by car , that added a fair bit to pollution .
cardiff council was criticised for promoting car use with its park-and-ride scheme and for not making recycling easier .
cardiff councillor elgan morgan admitted " we have some significant problems with these events and we do need to do more to reduce our footprint and find practical ways to do that . "
the researchers said they were not discouraging supporters to enjoy themselves , but they are warning that more and more big games and events will take their toll on the planet unless fans and organisers try to make them more sustainable .

ministers are to be briefed on the condition of the existing road bridge , thought to be in need of more intensive maintenance than previously thought .
engineering assessments and detailed reports will be considered before a decision is taken on whether to build a new bridge or construct a tunnel .
decisions are expected within the next two weeks , possibly by wednesday .
last november first minister jack mcconnell confirmed that labour was committed to the construction of the new crossing .
approved in principle further work will be needed before the executive chooses the type of bridge or tunnel it wants , the route it will take and the means of funding the work .
but the cabinet will be asked to approve plans for a replacement crossing in principle , as well as a broad timetable for its construction .
corrosion is a major problem with the present road bridge and its replacement has been the subject of fierce debate .
the new crossing is expected to be in place before the existing road bridge closes to traffic in 2013 .
on thursday a parliamentary debate on scrapping tolls on the forth and tay road bridges ended in stalemate after the parliament failed to agree a position .
both an snp motion calling for the abolition of the tolls , and an executive one calling for their retention , were defeated .
john mcgoldrick , from the national alliance against tolls , said : " the ministers who say that they want a new forth crossing are the same people who have fought to keep tolls on both the forth and tay .
" the assumption must be that this new crossing would also be tolled .
" we have calculated that the return tolls for cars would be about £ 7 .

customers have previously been allowed to check in more than one bag as long as they did not exceed weight restrictions .
