however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .
one thing is for sure and it 's the one thing that jogi löw is more than aware of .
in the business of coaching only one thing matters : winning trophies . geraldo hoffmann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .

perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .

"
finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .
which is where german parrot whisperer rita ohnhäuser steps in .
ohnhäuser recently celebrated bringing together her 2,000th pair of parrots through her avian dating agency based in schönefeld just outside berlin .
satisfying work finding mates for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " who 's a pretty boy then ? "
" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .
" my work is very satisfying , as parrots , like swans , will mate for life and remain faithful - parrot pairs stay together until the end . "
" it is really sweet to watch , " she added .
" they spend every minute of every day together , the male looking after the female and feeding her and sitting together on their perches . "
people can learn from parrot courtships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm sorry polly , there 's someone else " some birds , however , are quicker to jump on the monogamy wagon than others .
" i do n't have to do much other than make the introductions , some birds experience love at first sight , while others make a really careful choice before entering a relationship and need to be talked into it with a complicated courtship , " ohnhäuser said .
" it can take up to three months of being given the best bird seed or even building an elaborate nest to entice a reluctant partner . "
if we humans are forced to abandon our hermetically-sealed , web-connected lives in favor of the great outdoors in a bid to save our race , there can be few better blueprints for survival than that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal . " the russian connection lange estimates that the value of illegal german exports might easily exceed 150 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two plants at bushehr went online in april this year the exports are believed to have been organized by a bogus russian company situated in berlin .
this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.07.2007 löw celebrates a year of success before real test begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw has an impressive record but his tenure as germany coach will be judged by trophies joachim löw celebrates an impressive first year as the coach of germany 's soccer team on thursday .
however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .
one thing is for sure and it 's the one thing that jogi löw is more than aware of .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .

on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .

the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .

" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?

the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .
one thing is for sure and it 's the one thing that jogi löw is more than aware of .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .
one thing is for sure and it 's the one thing that jogi löw is more than aware of .

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .
" it ’ s a very slow , incremental process , " he said .

they say they oppose the mosque purely on the grounds that there are no muslims in the neighborhood and therefore no need for a mosque .
others say they fear an " islamization " of the area , and that the new building will turn a quiet part of berlin into a racial trouble-spot . muslim authorities argue that the mosque near the city 's tegel airport had become too crowded and that land in pankow-heinersdorf , which used to belong to the communist east german state , was cheap . neo-nazi backlash mosques are common in western berlin with its large turkish community , but this is the first to go up in the east of the city . the mosque is due to open in august 2008 in a former mustard factory in the tinius strasse to the 250 members of berlin 's ahmadiyya community , which is categorized by german authorities as tolerant and open-minded . but german authorities are concerned it will trigger a rise in right-wing extremism , particularly in the economically depressed east of the country where the ultra-right national democratic party has gained support in recent elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal . " the russian connection lange estimates that the value of illegal german exports might easily exceed 150 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two plants at bushehr went online in april this year the exports are believed to have been organized by a bogus russian company situated in berlin .
this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .
the state attorney now expects even more cases to go to court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal . " the russian connection lange estimates that the value of illegal german exports might easily exceed 150 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two plants at bushehr went online in april this year the exports are believed to have been organized by a bogus russian company situated in berlin .
this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .
the state attorney now expects even more cases to go to court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal . " the russian connection lange estimates that the value of illegal german exports might easily exceed 150 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two plants at bushehr went online in april this year the exports are believed to have been organized by a bogus russian company situated in berlin .
this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .
the state attorney now expects even more cases to go to court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .
" it ’ s a very slow , incremental process , " he said .

they say they oppose the mosque purely on the grounds that there are no muslims in the neighborhood and therefore no need for a mosque .
others say they fear an " islamization " of the area , and that the new building will turn a quiet part of berlin into a racial trouble-spot . muslim authorities argue that the mosque near the city 's tegel airport had become too crowded and that land in pankow-heinersdorf , which used to belong to the communist east german state , was cheap . neo-nazi backlash mosques are common in western berlin with its large turkish community , but this is the first to go up in the east of the city . the mosque is due to open in august 2008 in a former mustard factory in the tinius strasse to the 250 members of berlin 's ahmadiyya community , which is categorized by german authorities as tolerant and open-minded . but german authorities are concerned it will trigger a rise in right-wing extremism , particularly in the economically depressed east of the country where the ultra-right national democratic party has gained support in recent elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .
which is where german parrot whisperer rita ohnhäuser steps in .
ohnhäuser recently celebrated bringing together her 2,000th pair of parrots through her avian dating agency based in schönefeld just outside berlin .
satisfying work finding mates for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " who 's a pretty boy then ? "
" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .
" my work is very satisfying , as parrots , like swans , will mate for life and remain faithful - parrot pairs stay together until the end . "
" it is really sweet to watch , " she added .
" they spend every minute of every day together , the male looking after the female and feeding her and sitting together on their perches . "
people can learn from parrot courtships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm sorry polly , there 's someone else " some birds , however , are quicker to jump on the monogamy wagon than others .
" i do n't have to do much other than make the introductions , some birds experience love at first sight , while others make a really careful choice before entering a relationship and need to be talked into it with a complicated courtship , " ohnhäuser said .
" it can take up to three months of being given the best bird seed or even building an elaborate nest to entice a reluctant partner . "
if we humans are forced to abandon our hermetically-sealed , web-connected lives in favor of the great outdoors in a bid to save our race , there can be few better blueprints for survival than that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .

the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "
they have been pressed to train and employ larger numbers of immigrant youths .
brigitte zypries , germany 's justice minister , said a survey showed there were far too few minority trainees in public services . " a survey in 2005 of trainees in the public services found only 2.1 percent were foreign young people compared with 24 percent in job training overall , " she said .
the public services " clearly " told the summit they would try to improve this .

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?

the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "

he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "

not much is known about him other than the fact that he speaks english , is very interested in military aircraft and thinks he used to be air force pilot . but after analyzing the way the man talks , police determined that he either comes from or spent significant time in southern england . " the best indication is that he uses speech forms typical of the region , " a police spokesperson said . it 's the first major clue as to who " karl " might be , but the authorities remain puzzled by his occasional use of german words , and he does n't match the descriptions of people who have been reported missing . karl is around 60 years old , relatively short and thin .

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .

the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .

this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .

the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 12.07.2007 integrating foreigners an ongoing challenge for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is likely to remain a hot topic for years to come chancellor merkel hosts the second national integration summit on thursday .
but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .
" it ’ s a very slow , incremental process , " he said .

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .

" he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .

"
finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .
which is where german parrot whisperer rita ohnhäuser steps in .
ohnhäuser recently celebrated bringing together her 2,000th pair of parrots through her avian dating agency based in schönefeld just outside berlin .
satisfying work finding mates for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " who 's a pretty boy then ? "
" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .
" my work is very satisfying , as parrots , like swans , will mate for life and remain faithful - parrot pairs stay together until the end . "
" it is really sweet to watch , " she added .
" they spend every minute of every day together , the male looking after the female and feeding her and sitting together on their perches . "
people can learn from parrot courtships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm sorry polly , there 's someone else " some birds , however , are quicker to jump on the monogamy wagon than others .
" i do n't have to do much other than make the introductions , some birds experience love at first sight , while others make a really careful choice before entering a relationship and need to be talked into it with a complicated courtship , " ohnhäuser said .
" it can take up to three months of being given the best bird seed or even building an elaborate nest to entice a reluctant partner . "
if we humans are forced to abandon our hermetically-sealed , web-connected lives in favor of the great outdoors in a bid to save our race , there can be few better blueprints for survival than that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.07.2007 merkel hails integration milestone , hits back at critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said the government would not respond to ultimatums over the new plans chancellor angela merkel on thursday called germany 's new integration plan for immigrants " a milestone " and rejected criticism from ethnic turkish groups who boycotted a key summit on the issue . merkel was speaking at a press conference following a meeting with ethnic leaders in berlin to announce government assistance to minorities which are widely seen as becoming increasingly detached from the mainstream german society .
the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "
they have been pressed to train and employ larger numbers of immigrant youths .
brigitte zypries , germany 's justice minister , said a survey showed there were far too few minority trainees in public services . " a survey in 2005 of trainees in the public services found only 2.1 percent were foreign young people compared with 24 percent in job training overall , " she said .
the public services " clearly " told the summit they would try to improve this .
the cabinet also set a target of creating an additional 10,000 jobs for people of foreign origin by 2010 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "
they have been pressed to train and employ larger numbers of immigrant youths .
brigitte zypries , germany 's justice minister , said a survey showed there were far too few minority trainees in public services . " a survey in 2005 of trainees in the public services found only 2.1 percent were foreign young people compared with 24 percent in job training overall , " she said .
the public services " clearly " told the summit they would try to improve this .
the cabinet also set a target of creating an additional 10,000 jobs for people of foreign origin by 2010 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say they oppose the mosque purely on the grounds that there are no muslims in the neighborhood and therefore no need for a mosque .
others say they fear an " islamization " of the area , and that the new building will turn a quiet part of berlin into a racial trouble-spot . muslim authorities argue that the mosque near the city 's tegel airport had become too crowded and that land in pankow-heinersdorf , which used to belong to the communist east german state , was cheap . neo-nazi backlash mosques are common in western berlin with its large turkish community , but this is the first to go up in the east of the city . the mosque is due to open in august 2008 in a former mustard factory in the tinius strasse to the 250 members of berlin 's ahmadiyya community , which is categorized by german authorities as tolerant and open-minded . but german authorities are concerned it will trigger a rise in right-wing extremism , particularly in the economically depressed east of the country where the ultra-right national democratic party has gained support in recent elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 12.07.2007 integrating foreigners an ongoing challenge for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is likely to remain a hot topic for years to come chancellor merkel hosts the second national integration summit on thursday .
but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .
" it ’ s a very slow , incremental process , " he said .

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal .

this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.07.2007 löw celebrates a year of success before real test begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw has an impressive record but his tenure as germany coach will be judged by trophies joachim löw celebrates an impressive first year as the coach of germany 's soccer team on thursday .
however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .
one thing is for sure and it 's the one thing that jogi löw is more than aware of .

finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .
which is where german parrot whisperer rita ohnhäuser steps in .
ohnhäuser recently celebrated bringing together her 2,000th pair of parrots through her avian dating agency based in schönefeld just outside berlin .
satisfying work finding mates for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " who 's a pretty boy then ? "
" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .
" my work is very satisfying , as parrots , like swans , will mate for life and remain faithful - parrot pairs stay together until the end . "
" it is really sweet to watch , " she added .
" they spend every minute of every day together , the male looking after the female and feeding her and sitting together on their perches . "
people can learn from parrot courtships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm sorry polly , there 's someone else " some birds , however , are quicker to jump on the monogamy wagon than others .
" i do n't have to do much other than make the introductions , some birds experience love at first sight , while others make a really careful choice before entering a relationship and need to be talked into it with a complicated courtship , " ohnhäuser said .

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas .

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .

this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .

under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.07.2007 merkel hails integration milestone , hits back at critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said the government would not respond to ultimatums over the new plans chancellor angela merkel on thursday called germany 's new integration plan for immigrants " a milestone " and rejected criticism from ethnic turkish groups who boycotted a key summit on the issue . merkel was speaking at a press conference following a meeting with ethnic leaders in berlin to announce government assistance to minorities which are widely seen as becoming increasingly detached from the mainstream german society .
the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .

the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .

" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .
" it ’ s a very slow , incremental process , " he said .
" there are no quick fixes here . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say they oppose the mosque purely on the grounds that there are no muslims in the neighborhood and therefore no need for a mosque .
others say they fear an " islamization " of the area , and that the new building will turn a quiet part of berlin into a racial trouble-spot . muslim authorities argue that the mosque near the city 's tegel airport had become too crowded and that land in pankow-heinersdorf , which used to belong to the communist east german state , was cheap . neo-nazi backlash mosques are common in western berlin with its large turkish community , but this is the first to go up in the east of the city . the mosque is due to open in august 2008 in a former mustard factory in the tinius strasse to the 250 members of berlin 's ahmadiyya community , which is categorized by german authorities as tolerant and open-minded . but german authorities are concerned it will trigger a rise in right-wing extremism , particularly in the economically depressed east of the country where the ultra-right national democratic party has gained support in recent elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but we have freedom of religion here .
what i respect are the efforts of german muslims to integrate into society . " plans to build the mosque have been opposed in recent months by some cologne residents and an atheist novelist of jewish heritage , ralph giordano , 85 , who said muslims should learn secular values and integrate into germany . wallraff , a gadfly writer known for conducting undercover research to bring to light what he considers society 's injustices - such as " lowest of the low , " in which he describes the treatment he received while posing as a turkish worker in germany - said he would demand police protection if need be so that he could read aloud from the rushdie book he said he considers a " literary masterpiece . " " if i do this then i want to make a difference ; it 's not meant to be a provocation , " he said in an interview that appeared in several german media outlets , adding that the book should be read and discussed by the muslim public , which " currently is condemning something it does not know about . " long-time friend of rushdie 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie went into hiding after writing " the satanic verses " rushdie , who stayed in wallraff 's apartment in cologne during visits to cologne in the 1990s , was put under police protection in 1989 after the late ayatollah khomeini of iran called " the satanic verses " an " insult to islam " and issued a fatwa to kill rushdie . nearly 10 years after khomeini 's death in 1989 , tehran admitted that while the fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented . rushdie reentered the news last month when britain announced that rushdie would be knighted .
though the ceremony has not yet taken place , the decision to honor the author sparked discussion in the muslim world .
an al qaeda terrorist leader has threatened a " very precise response " in great britain should rushdie be knighted . britain 's prime minister gordon brown , however , defended the controversial knighthood for author rushdie on wednesday . " nothing can justify either threats to the united kingdom or any form of terrorist activity and it must be the right of the united kingdom to make its own decisions on all these issues , " brown said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .
one thing is for sure and it 's the one thing that jogi löw is more than aware of .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .

" but we have freedom of religion here .
what i respect are the efforts of german muslims to integrate into society . " plans to build the mosque have been opposed in recent months by some cologne residents and an atheist novelist of jewish heritage , ralph giordano , 85 , who said muslims should learn secular values and integrate into germany . wallraff , a gadfly writer known for conducting undercover research to bring to light what he considers society 's injustices - such as " lowest of the low , " in which he describes the treatment he received while posing as a turkish worker in germany - said he would demand police protection if need be so that he could read aloud from the rushdie book he said he considers a " literary masterpiece . " " if i do this then i want to make a difference ; it 's not meant to be a provocation , " he said in an interview that appeared in several german media outlets , adding that the book should be read and discussed by the muslim public , which " currently is condemning something it does not know about . " long-time friend of rushdie 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie went into hiding after writing " the satanic verses " rushdie , who stayed in wallraff 's apartment in cologne during visits to cologne in the 1990s , was put under police protection in 1989 after the late ayatollah khomeini of iran called " the satanic verses " an " insult to islam " and issued a fatwa to kill rushdie . nearly 10 years after khomeini 's death in 1989 , tehran admitted that while the fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented . rushdie reentered the news last month when britain announced that rushdie would be knighted .
though the ceremony has not yet taken place , the decision to honor the author sparked discussion in the muslim world .
an al qaeda terrorist leader has threatened a " very precise response " in great britain should rushdie be knighted . britain 's prime minister gordon brown , however , defended the controversial knighthood for author rushdie on wednesday . " nothing can justify either threats to the united kingdom or any form of terrorist activity and it must be the right of the united kingdom to make its own decisions on all these issues , " brown said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas . " strange " the german foreign office described as strange both the contents of the letter and procedure behind the call , as well who the letter had been addressed to . the letter went " very clearly " beyond the " very specific and very purpose " of blair 's mandate , german foreign office spokesman jens plötner said . indeed , the release of the letter coincided with press reports that blair was seeking to widen his mandate as envoy for the middle east quartet , which includes russia , the eu , the us and the united nations . road map obsolete ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the road map failed ?
but the letter also contained elements which middle east quartet would question , plötner said . this included references for instance to claim that the so-called road map - the peace plan for the middle east - was obsolete . " the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing . " " the quartet is a kind guardian of the road map , " plötner said , stressing that both israel and leading palestinian figures had given their support to the plan . the letter which was signed by the foreign ministers of france , slovenia , spain , portugal , cyprus , bulgaria , romania , italy , greece and malta , emerged from an informal meeting in slovenia , and is believed to have been initiated by french foreign minister bernard kouchner . the german foreign office spokesman said berlin believed strongly that european middle east policy should be overseen by the eu council responsible for foreign affairs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.07.2007 merkel hails integration milestone , hits back at critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said the government would not respond to ultimatums over the new plans chancellor angela merkel on thursday called germany 's new integration plan for immigrants " a milestone " and rejected criticism from ethnic turkish groups who boycotted a key summit on the issue . merkel was speaking at a press conference following a meeting with ethnic leaders in berlin to announce government assistance to minorities which are widely seen as becoming increasingly detached from the mainstream german society .
the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "
they have been pressed to train and employ larger numbers of immigrant youths .
brigitte zypries , germany 's justice minister , said a survey showed there were far too few minority trainees in public services . " a survey in 2005 of trainees in the public services found only 2.1 percent were foreign young people compared with 24 percent in job training overall , " she said .
the public services " clearly " told the summit they would try to improve this .
the cabinet also set a target of creating an additional 10,000 jobs for people of foreign origin by 2010 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but we have freedom of religion here .
what i respect are the efforts of german muslims to integrate into society . " plans to build the mosque have been opposed in recent months by some cologne residents and an atheist novelist of jewish heritage , ralph giordano , 85 , who said muslims should learn secular values and integrate into germany . wallraff , a gadfly writer known for conducting undercover research to bring to light what he considers society 's injustices - such as " lowest of the low , " in which he describes the treatment he received while posing as a turkish worker in germany - said he would demand police protection if need be so that he could read aloud from the rushdie book he said he considers a " literary masterpiece . " " if i do this then i want to make a difference ; it 's not meant to be a provocation , " he said in an interview that appeared in several german media outlets , adding that the book should be read and discussed by the muslim public , which " currently is condemning something it does not know about .

" but we have freedom of religion here .
what i respect are the efforts of german muslims to integrate into society . " plans to build the mosque have been opposed in recent months by some cologne residents and an atheist novelist of jewish heritage , ralph giordano , 85 , who said muslims should learn secular values and integrate into germany . wallraff , a gadfly writer known for conducting undercover research to bring to light what he considers society 's injustices - such as " lowest of the low , " in which he describes the treatment he received while posing as a turkish worker in germany - said he would demand police protection if need be so that he could read aloud from the rushdie book he said he considers a " literary masterpiece . " " if i do this then i want to make a difference ; it 's not meant to be a provocation , " he said in an interview that appeared in several german media outlets , adding that the book should be read and discussed by the muslim public , which " currently is condemning something it does not know about . " long-time friend of rushdie 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie went into hiding after writing " the satanic verses " rushdie , who stayed in wallraff 's apartment in cologne during visits to cologne in the 1990s , was put under police protection in 1989 after the late ayatollah khomeini of iran called " the satanic verses " an " insult to islam " and issued a fatwa to kill rushdie . nearly 10 years after khomeini 's death in 1989 , tehran admitted that while the fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented . rushdie reentered the news last month when britain announced that rushdie would be knighted .

they say they oppose the mosque purely on the grounds that there are no muslims in the neighborhood and therefore no need for a mosque .
others say they fear an " islamization " of the area , and that the new building will turn a quiet part of berlin into a racial trouble-spot . muslim authorities argue that the mosque near the city 's tegel airport had become too crowded and that land in pankow-heinersdorf , which used to belong to the communist east german state , was cheap . neo-nazi backlash mosques are common in western berlin with its large turkish community , but this is the first to go up in the east of the city . the mosque is due to open in august 2008 in a former mustard factory in the tinius strasse to the 250 members of berlin 's ahmadiyya community , which is categorized by german authorities as tolerant and open-minded . but german authorities are concerned it will trigger a rise in right-wing extremism , particularly in the economically depressed east of the country where the ultra-right national democratic party has gained support in recent elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas . " strange " the german foreign office described as strange both the contents of the letter and procedure behind the call , as well who the letter had been addressed to . the letter went " very clearly " beyond the " very specific and very purpose " of blair 's mandate , german foreign office spokesman jens plötner said . indeed , the release of the letter coincided with press reports that blair was seeking to widen his mandate as envoy for the middle east quartet , which includes russia , the eu , the us and the united nations . road map obsolete ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the road map failed ?
but the letter also contained elements which middle east quartet would question , plötner said . this included references for instance to claim that the so-called road map - the peace plan for the middle east - was obsolete . " the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing . " " the quartet is a kind guardian of the road map , " plötner said , stressing that both israel and leading palestinian figures had given their support to the plan . the letter which was signed by the foreign ministers of france , slovenia , spain , portugal , cyprus , bulgaria , romania , italy , greece and malta , emerged from an informal meeting in slovenia , and is believed to have been initiated by french foreign minister bernard kouchner . the german foreign office spokesman said berlin believed strongly that european middle east policy should be overseen by the eu council responsible for foreign affairs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas . " strange " the german foreign office described as strange both the contents of the letter and procedure behind the call , as well who the letter had been addressed to . the letter went " very clearly " beyond the " very specific and very purpose " of blair 's mandate , german foreign office spokesman jens plötner said . indeed , the release of the letter coincided with press reports that blair was seeking to widen his mandate as envoy for the middle east quartet , which includes russia , the eu , the us and the united nations . road map obsolete ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the road map failed ?
but the letter also contained elements which middle east quartet would question , plötner said . this included references for instance to claim that the so-called road map - the peace plan for the middle east - was obsolete . " the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing . " " the quartet is a kind guardian of the road map , " plötner said , stressing that both israel and leading palestinian figures had given their support to the plan . the letter which was signed by the foreign ministers of france , slovenia , spain , portugal , cyprus , bulgaria , romania , italy , greece and malta , emerged from an informal meeting in slovenia , and is believed to have been initiated by french foreign minister bernard kouchner . the german foreign office spokesman said berlin believed strongly that european middle east policy should be overseen by the eu council responsible for foreign affairs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 12.07.2007 integrating foreigners an ongoing challenge for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is likely to remain a hot topic for years to come chancellor merkel hosts the second national integration summit on thursday .
but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy .

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .

moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .

the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .

" but we have freedom of religion here .
what i respect are the efforts of german muslims to integrate into society . " plans to build the mosque have been opposed in recent months by some cologne residents and an atheist novelist of jewish heritage , ralph giordano , 85 , who said muslims should learn secular values and integrate into germany . wallraff , a gadfly writer known for conducting undercover research to bring to light what he considers society 's injustices - such as " lowest of the low , " in which he describes the treatment he received while posing as a turkish worker in germany - said he would demand police protection if need be so that he could read aloud from the rushdie book he said he considers a " literary masterpiece . " " if i do this then i want to make a difference ; it 's not meant to be a provocation , " he said in an interview that appeared in several german media outlets , adding that the book should be read and discussed by the muslim public , which " currently is condemning something it does not know about . " long-time friend of rushdie 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie went into hiding after writing " the satanic verses " rushdie , who stayed in wallraff 's apartment in cologne during visits to cologne in the 1990s , was put under police protection in 1989 after the late ayatollah khomeini of iran called " the satanic verses " an " insult to islam " and issued a fatwa to kill rushdie . nearly 10 years after khomeini 's death in 1989 , tehran admitted that while the fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented . rushdie reentered the news last month when britain announced that rushdie would be knighted .
though the ceremony has not yet taken place , the decision to honor the author sparked discussion in the muslim world .
an al qaeda terrorist leader has threatened a " very precise response " in great britain should rushdie be knighted . britain 's prime minister gordon brown , however , defended the controversial knighthood for author rushdie on wednesday . " nothing can justify either threats to the united kingdom or any form of terrorist activity and it must be the right of the united kingdom to make its own decisions on all these issues , " brown said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas . " strange " the german foreign office described as strange both the contents of the letter and procedure behind the call , as well who the letter had been addressed to . the letter went " very clearly " beyond the " very specific and very purpose " of blair 's mandate , german foreign office spokesman jens plötner said . indeed , the release of the letter coincided with press reports that blair was seeking to widen his mandate as envoy for the middle east quartet , which includes russia , the eu , the us and the united nations . road map obsolete ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the road map failed ?
but the letter also contained elements which middle east quartet would question , plötner said . this included references for instance to claim that the so-called road map - the peace plan for the middle east - was obsolete . " the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing . " " the quartet is a kind guardian of the road map , " plötner said , stressing that both israel and leading palestinian figures had given their support to the plan . the letter which was signed by the foreign ministers of france , slovenia , spain , portugal , cyprus , bulgaria , romania , italy , greece and malta , emerged from an informal meeting in slovenia , and is believed to have been initiated by french foreign minister bernard kouchner . the german foreign office spokesman said berlin believed strongly that european middle east policy should be overseen by the eu council responsible for foreign affairs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .

the man , who calls himself " karl , " is probably from southern england .

not much is known about him other than the fact that he speaks english , is very interested in military aircraft and thinks he used to be air force pilot . but after analyzing the way the man talks , police determined that he either comes from or spent significant time in southern england . " the best indication is that he uses speech forms typical of the region , " a police spokesperson said . it 's the first major clue as to who " karl " might be , but the authorities remain puzzled by his occasional use of german words , and he does n't match the descriptions of people who have been reported missing . karl is around 60 years old , relatively short and thin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.07.2007 löw celebrates a year of success before real test begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw has an impressive record but his tenure as germany coach will be judged by trophies joachim löw celebrates an impressive first year as the coach of germany 's soccer team on thursday .
however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .

it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements .

" the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing .

" but we have freedom of religion here .
what i respect are the efforts of german muslims to integrate into society . " plans to build the mosque have been opposed in recent months by some cologne residents and an atheist novelist of jewish heritage , ralph giordano , 85 , who said muslims should learn secular values and integrate into germany . wallraff , a gadfly writer known for conducting undercover research to bring to light what he considers society 's injustices - such as " lowest of the low , " in which he describes the treatment he received while posing as a turkish worker in germany - said he would demand police protection if need be so that he could read aloud from the rushdie book he said he considers a " literary masterpiece . " " if i do this then i want to make a difference ; it 's not meant to be a provocation , " he said in an interview that appeared in several german media outlets , adding that the book should be read and discussed by the muslim public , which " currently is condemning something it does not know about . " long-time friend of rushdie 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie went into hiding after writing " the satanic verses " rushdie , who stayed in wallraff 's apartment in cologne during visits to cologne in the 1990s , was put under police protection in 1989 after the late ayatollah khomeini of iran called " the satanic verses " an " insult to islam " and issued a fatwa to kill rushdie . nearly 10 years after khomeini 's death in 1989 , tehran admitted that while the fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented . rushdie reentered the news last month when britain announced that rushdie would be knighted .
though the ceremony has not yet taken place , the decision to honor the author sparked discussion in the muslim world .
an al qaeda terrorist leader has threatened a " very precise response " in great britain should rushdie be knighted . britain 's prime minister gordon brown , however , defended the controversial knighthood for author rushdie on wednesday . " nothing can justify either threats to the united kingdom or any form of terrorist activity and it must be the right of the united kingdom to make its own decisions on all these issues , " brown said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .

these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .

" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .

perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .
which is where german parrot whisperer rita ohnhäuser steps in .
ohnhäuser recently celebrated bringing together her 2,000th pair of parrots through her avian dating agency based in schönefeld just outside berlin .
satisfying work finding mates for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " who 's a pretty boy then ? "
" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .
" my work is very satisfying , as parrots , like swans , will mate for life and remain faithful - parrot pairs stay together until the end . "
" it is really sweet to watch , " she added .
" they spend every minute of every day together , the male looking after the female and feeding her and sitting together on their perches . "
people can learn from parrot courtships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm sorry polly , there 's someone else " some birds , however , are quicker to jump on the monogamy wagon than others .
" i do n't have to do much other than make the introductions , some birds experience love at first sight , while others make a really careful choice before entering a relationship and need to be talked into it with a complicated courtship , " ohnhäuser said .
" it can take up to three months of being given the best bird seed or even building an elaborate nest to entice a reluctant partner . "
if we humans are forced to abandon our hermetically-sealed , web-connected lives in favor of the great outdoors in a bid to save our race , there can be few better blueprints for survival than that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say they oppose the mosque purely on the grounds that there are no muslims in the neighborhood and therefore no need for a mosque .
others say they fear an " islamization " of the area , and that the new building will turn a quiet part of berlin into a racial trouble-spot . muslim authorities argue that the mosque near the city 's tegel airport had become too crowded and that land in pankow-heinersdorf , which used to belong to the communist east german state , was cheap . neo-nazi backlash mosques are common in western berlin with its large turkish community , but this is the first to go up in the east of the city . the mosque is due to open in august 2008 in a former mustard factory in the tinius strasse to the 250 members of berlin 's ahmadiyya community , which is categorized by german authorities as tolerant and open-minded . but german authorities are concerned it will trigger a rise in right-wing extremism , particularly in the economically depressed east of the country where the ultra-right national democratic party has gained support in recent elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal .

this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal . " the russian connection lange estimates that the value of illegal german exports might easily exceed 150 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two plants at bushehr went online in april this year the exports are believed to have been organized by a bogus russian company situated in berlin .
this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .
the state attorney now expects even more cases to go to court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?

the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "

" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .

the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .

germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .

the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "
they have been pressed to train and employ larger numbers of immigrant youths .
brigitte zypries , germany 's justice minister , said a survey showed there were far too few minority trainees in public services . " a survey in 2005 of trainees in the public services found only 2.1 percent were foreign young people compared with 24 percent in job training overall , " she said .
the public services " clearly " told the summit they would try to improve this .
the cabinet also set a target of creating an additional 10,000 jobs for people of foreign origin by 2010 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say they oppose the mosque purely on the grounds that there are no muslims in the neighborhood and therefore no need for a mosque .
others say they fear an " islamization " of the area , and that the new building will turn a quiet part of berlin into a racial trouble-spot . muslim authorities argue that the mosque near the city 's tegel airport had become too crowded and that land in pankow-heinersdorf , which used to belong to the communist east german state , was cheap . neo-nazi backlash mosques are common in western berlin with its large turkish community , but this is the first to go up in the east of the city . the mosque is due to open in august 2008 in a former mustard factory in the tinius strasse to the 250 members of berlin 's ahmadiyya community , which is categorized by german authorities as tolerant and open-minded . but german authorities are concerned it will trigger a rise in right-wing extremism , particularly in the economically depressed east of the country where the ultra-right national democratic party has gained support in recent elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .
" it ’ s a very slow , incremental process , " he said .

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas . " strange " the german foreign office described as strange both the contents of the letter and procedure behind the call , as well who the letter had been addressed to . the letter went " very clearly " beyond the " very specific and very purpose " of blair 's mandate , german foreign office spokesman jens plötner said . indeed , the release of the letter coincided with press reports that blair was seeking to widen his mandate as envoy for the middle east quartet , which includes russia , the eu , the us and the united nations . road map obsolete ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the road map failed ?
but the letter also contained elements which middle east quartet would question , plötner said . this included references for instance to claim that the so-called road map - the peace plan for the middle east - was obsolete . " the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing . " " the quartet is a kind guardian of the road map , " plötner said , stressing that both israel and leading palestinian figures had given their support to the plan . the letter which was signed by the foreign ministers of france , slovenia , spain , portugal , cyprus , bulgaria , romania , italy , greece and malta , emerged from an informal meeting in slovenia , and is believed to have been initiated by french foreign minister bernard kouchner . the german foreign office spokesman said berlin believed strongly that european middle east policy should be overseen by the eu council responsible for foreign affairs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but we have freedom of religion here .
what i respect are the efforts of german muslims to integrate into society . " plans to build the mosque have been opposed in recent months by some cologne residents and an atheist novelist of jewish heritage , ralph giordano , 85 , who said muslims should learn secular values and integrate into germany . wallraff , a gadfly writer known for conducting undercover research to bring to light what he considers society 's injustices - such as " lowest of the low , " in which he describes the treatment he received while posing as a turkish worker in germany - said he would demand police protection if need be so that he could read aloud from the rushdie book he said he considers a " literary masterpiece . " " if i do this then i want to make a difference ; it 's not meant to be a provocation , " he said in an interview that appeared in several german media outlets , adding that the book should be read and discussed by the muslim public , which " currently is condemning something it does not know about . " long-time friend of rushdie 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie went into hiding after writing " the satanic verses " rushdie , who stayed in wallraff 's apartment in cologne during visits to cologne in the 1990s , was put under police protection in 1989 after the late ayatollah khomeini of iran called " the satanic verses " an " insult to islam " and issued a fatwa to kill rushdie . nearly 10 years after khomeini 's death in 1989 , tehran admitted that while the fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented . rushdie reentered the news last month when britain announced that rushdie would be knighted .
though the ceremony has not yet taken place , the decision to honor the author sparked discussion in the muslim world .
an al qaeda terrorist leader has threatened a " very precise response " in great britain should rushdie be knighted . britain 's prime minister gordon brown , however , defended the controversial knighthood for author rushdie on wednesday . " nothing can justify either threats to the united kingdom or any form of terrorist activity and it must be the right of the united kingdom to make its own decisions on all these issues , " brown said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .
which is where german parrot whisperer rita ohnhäuser steps in .
ohnhäuser recently celebrated bringing together her 2,000th pair of parrots through her avian dating agency based in schönefeld just outside berlin .
satisfying work finding mates for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " who 's a pretty boy then ? "
" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .
" my work is very satisfying , as parrots , like swans , will mate for life and remain faithful - parrot pairs stay together until the end . "
" it is really sweet to watch , " she added .
" they spend every minute of every day together , the male looking after the female and feeding her and sitting together on their perches . "
people can learn from parrot courtships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm sorry polly , there 's someone else " some birds , however , are quicker to jump on the monogamy wagon than others .
" i do n't have to do much other than make the introductions , some birds experience love at first sight , while others make a really careful choice before entering a relationship and need to be talked into it with a complicated courtship , " ohnhäuser said .
" it can take up to three months of being given the best bird seed or even building an elaborate nest to entice a reluctant partner . "
if we humans are forced to abandon our hermetically-sealed , web-connected lives in favor of the great outdoors in a bid to save our race , there can be few better blueprints for survival than that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .

not much is known about him other than the fact that he speaks english , is very interested in military aircraft and thinks he used to be air force pilot . but after analyzing the way the man talks , police determined that he either comes from or spent significant time in southern england . " the best indication is that he uses speech forms typical of the region , " a police spokesperson said . it 's the first major clue as to who " karl " might be , but the authorities remain puzzled by his occasional use of german words , and he does n't match the descriptions of people who have been reported missing . karl is around 60 years old , relatively short and thin .

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "

" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .

the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "
they have been pressed to train and employ larger numbers of immigrant youths .
brigitte zypries , germany 's justice minister , said a survey showed there were far too few minority trainees in public services . " a survey in 2005 of trainees in the public services found only 2.1 percent were foreign young people compared with 24 percent in job training overall , " she said .
the public services " clearly " told the summit they would try to improve this .

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "
they have been pressed to train and employ larger numbers of immigrant youths .
brigitte zypries , germany 's justice minister , said a survey showed there were far too few minority trainees in public services . " a survey in 2005 of trainees in the public services found only 2.1 percent were foreign young people compared with 24 percent in job training overall , " she said .
the public services " clearly " told the summit they would try to improve this .
the cabinet also set a target of creating an additional 10,000 jobs for people of foreign origin by 2010 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.07.2007 löw celebrates a year of success before real test begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw has an impressive record but his tenure as germany coach will be judged by trophies joachim löw celebrates an impressive first year as the coach of germany 's soccer team on thursday .
however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .
one thing is for sure and it 's the one thing that jogi löw is more than aware of .

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas . " strange " the german foreign office described as strange both the contents of the letter and procedure behind the call , as well who the letter had been addressed to . the letter went " very clearly " beyond the " very specific and very purpose " of blair 's mandate , german foreign office spokesman jens plötner said . indeed , the release of the letter coincided with press reports that blair was seeking to widen his mandate as envoy for the middle east quartet , which includes russia , the eu , the us and the united nations . road map obsolete ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the road map failed ?
but the letter also contained elements which middle east quartet would question , plötner said . this included references for instance to claim that the so-called road map - the peace plan for the middle east - was obsolete . " the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing . " " the quartet is a kind guardian of the road map , " plötner said , stressing that both israel and leading palestinian figures had given their support to the plan . the letter which was signed by the foreign ministers of france , slovenia , spain , portugal , cyprus , bulgaria , romania , italy , greece and malta , emerged from an informal meeting in slovenia , and is believed to have been initiated by french foreign minister bernard kouchner . the german foreign office spokesman said berlin believed strongly that european middle east policy should be overseen by the eu council responsible for foreign affairs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas . " strange " the german foreign office described as strange both the contents of the letter and procedure behind the call , as well who the letter had been addressed to . the letter went " very clearly " beyond the " very specific and very purpose " of blair 's mandate , german foreign office spokesman jens plötner said . indeed , the release of the letter coincided with press reports that blair was seeking to widen his mandate as envoy for the middle east quartet , which includes russia , the eu , the us and the united nations . road map obsolete ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the road map failed ?
but the letter also contained elements which middle east quartet would question , plötner said . this included references for instance to claim that the so-called road map - the peace plan for the middle east - was obsolete . " the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing . " " the quartet is a kind guardian of the road map , " plötner said , stressing that both israel and leading palestinian figures had given their support to the plan . the letter which was signed by the foreign ministers of france , slovenia , spain , portugal , cyprus , bulgaria , romania , italy , greece and malta , emerged from an informal meeting in slovenia , and is believed to have been initiated by french foreign minister bernard kouchner . the german foreign office spokesman said berlin believed strongly that european middle east policy should be overseen by the eu council responsible for foreign affairs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , should they qualify , the euro 2008 championships will really show what the coach and his players can do . july 12 , 2007 will mark the end of joachim löw 's first year as coach of the german national team .
he is hailed for his nearly flawless record in the job , just one defeat in 11 games - and that was in a friendly in which he fielded youth players and reserves .
yet , for all the accolades , löw has still yet to win any trophies , and the real test is still on the horizon : the 2008 european championships .
twelve months ago , löw was known only as the tactical assistant at jürgen klinsmann 's side .
jogi , as he is affectionately known , was never a big star or a hugely successful manager .
his time as both player and manager was rarely ever spent in the top division .
he has also never been a big media celebrity like his predecessors in the national team coaching job .
on july 12 , 2006 , just three days after the world cup final , löw was officially crowned as klinsmann 's successor .
a month later , he was celebrating his first game and first victory as germany launched the löw era with a 3-0 friendly win over sweden , who germany also beat during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi was integral in the world cup run under klinsi as his first season drew to a close , löw could be proud of his record : nine victories , one draw and one defeat with 37goals for and six against .
germany also look to be a shoo-in for euro 2008 , leading qualifying group d with 19 points , five ahead of the second-placed czech republic .
in his first year in office , löw also showed that he had the courage to experiment and look toward the future .
he gave international debuts to 13 players , and both international new-comers and established stars have responded to his leadership by helping the new boss set records .
when germany thrashed san marino 13-0 in the euro 2008 qualifiers , it was the highest winning margin germany had ever had in the tournament 's history .
under löw , germany are now ranked fourth in the world , overtaking argentina and sitting hard on the heels of brazil .
löw 's germany lavished with praise löw has also won over the public and press with ease .
his record has led to headlines such as " joachim löw : a record that creates enthusiasm " and " löw : the perfect coach . "
the fans love him for extending the world cup party by another year and his current team looks to be brimming with confidence as they continue the journey klinsmann started them on during the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw 's germany have yet to face the big guns who haunt them the level of praise sometimes even borders on hysteria and the usually cool löw is not immune .
he put germany on the same level as world cup winners italy , beaten finalists france , semi-finalists portugal and quarter-finalists england .
but , showing his renowned intelligence , he quickly inserted the modest " but nobody should say that we are the top team in europe " qualifier into his statement .
and wisely so .
since the world cup , germany have yet to play any of the teams that löw mentioned in the same breath with his own .
löw 's side has come up against a roll call of international soccer minnows ; san marino , georgia , cyprus and switzerland , none of which is a reliable gauge as to how your team rates - though previous germany teams have been undone by these very same minnows .
flashes of world-class quality however , there have been real examples of quality play .
the convincing victory against the czechs in prague was belied by the close 2-1 score line , and the first half of the 4-1 win against slovakia in bratislava was an example of fantasy soccer that did not go unnoticed by the media .
" pedigrees against mongrels , " wrote christof knerr in the süddeutsche zeitung after the slovakia game .
despite mopping the floor with san marino in the 6-0 return game in group d , the german 11 were booed at half-time by their own fans , not only because the 13-0 win from the first game had spoilt them but because they were witnessing a disjointed display as germany ran around like headless chickens , presumably after forgetting what the goal looked like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lethargic germany made hard work of slovakia in june the return game against the slovaks in hamburg in june this year was also less than imperious .
after booking the 2-1 victory , germany looked a spent force by the end - not surprising considering that most of the players had recently finished over 50 top flight games in the season .
the löw philosophy of play may be another factor explaining why when germany look capable of beating the best fifa has to offer when they play at high speed , but seem clueless when left with too much time to ponder the opposition .
" we have evaluated everything : running technique , speed , distances .
we have determined that the possession-rate , how long the ball stays with a player , is 1.9 seconds , " löw said recently .
" fifteen months ago , the time the ball spent at the player 's feet between receiving and passing the ball was 2.8 seconds . "
löw is aiming for a high-tempo style for germany , and he is getting there .
all that glitters is not always gold however , there are other factors which paint a slightly false picture of germany 's strengths .
the goals for and goals against record under löw is slightly deceptive as 13 of the 37 goals scored came against san marino .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miro klose went off the boil for both germany and bremen there are also concerns that the goal scorers may be a little fragile with both miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi suffering from droughts and dips in confidence towards the end of the season .
lukas podolski meanwhile had an indifferent season at bayern munich and ended the season out injured .
löw 's first year has been impressive , but he has hardly had to re-invent the wheel .
klinsmann left a culture of confidence and success that his right-hand man has taken over and continued .
löw has also yet to come up against any of the top teams in real competition .
and while he has brought germany to the very brink of qualification for euro 2008 , he has n't won anything yet .

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal . " the russian connection lange estimates that the value of illegal german exports might easily exceed 150 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two plants at bushehr went online in april this year the exports are believed to have been organized by a bogus russian company situated in berlin .
this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .
the state attorney now expects even more cases to go to court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , german firms exported equipment to the bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf . some experts fear that iran might use these reactors in the future to build a nuclear bomb .
they say the bushehr reactor could produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which would be enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
the prosecution office in potsdam near berlin has been looking into illegal exports to iran since sept .
2004 . christoph lange , who is a spokesperson for state prosecutors , said on thursday that the case was getting bigger every week .
the number of german firms involved in the matter has now grown to more than 50 . " they export the technology , " lange said .
" that 's illegal . " the russian connection lange estimates that the value of illegal german exports might easily exceed 150 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two plants at bushehr went online in april this year the exports are believed to have been organized by a bogus russian company situated in berlin .
this company allegedly first transported the equipment across the polish border to russia , which has a 1995 contract to repair and complete the german-built iranian power reactor at bushehr .
moscow - unlike berlin - does n't oppose any nuclear exports to iran .
because of the german design , standard russian nuclear equipment would not fit existing reactor parts in bushehr .
the site , built in 1974 by german company siemens , was bombed and badly damaged during the first gulf war .
companies knew the final destination of parts lange said prosecutors believed only about 12 firms knowingly broke export restrictions .
the rest were innocent , as they had only been invited to tender for the work or had believed the parts were going to russia .
but , lange adds , " a few of them did know " the true destination of the parts .
according to lange , several business people involved have already been convicted and have received suspended jail terms or fines .
the state attorney now expects even more cases to go to court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the call from eu foreign ministers largely representing the eu 's mediterranean states was contained in an open letter to tony blair , appointed the international community 's new big-power middle east envoy after stepping down last month as british prime minister . broadly , the group proposed a " redefinition of objectives , " starting with an international conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict .
it also urged israel to make more concessions to peace , in support of the palestinian president . " -lrb- we want -rrb- to obtain from israel concrete and immediate measures in favor of mahmoud abbas , " the ministers said . these included " the transfer of all taxes due , the release of the thousands of prisoners who do not have blood on their hands , the release as well of the main palestinian leaders to ensure succession within fatah , a freeze in new settlements and the evacuation of unauthorized settlements . " the group also proposed a resumption of talks with hamas . " strange " the german foreign office described as strange both the contents of the letter and procedure behind the call , as well who the letter had been addressed to . the letter went " very clearly " beyond the " very specific and very purpose " of blair 's mandate , german foreign office spokesman jens plötner said . indeed , the release of the letter coincided with press reports that blair was seeking to widen his mandate as envoy for the middle east quartet , which includes russia , the eu , the us and the united nations . road map obsolete ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the road map failed ?
but the letter also contained elements which middle east quartet would question , plötner said . this included references for instance to claim that the so-called road map - the peace plan for the middle east - was obsolete . " the road map has failed , " read the letter , which was published in french daily le monde .
" the status quo that has prevailed since 2000 is leading to nothing . " " the quartet is a kind guardian of the road map , " plötner said , stressing that both israel and leading palestinian figures had given their support to the plan . the letter which was signed by the foreign ministers of france , slovenia , spain , portugal , cyprus , bulgaria , romania , italy , greece and malta , emerged from an informal meeting in slovenia , and is believed to have been initiated by french foreign minister bernard kouchner . the german foreign office spokesman said berlin believed strongly that european middle east policy should be overseen by the eu council responsible for foreign affairs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .
which is where german parrot whisperer rita ohnhäuser steps in .
ohnhäuser recently celebrated bringing together her 2,000th pair of parrots through her avian dating agency based in schönefeld just outside berlin .
satisfying work finding mates for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " who 's a pretty boy then ? "
" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .
" my work is very satisfying , as parrots , like swans , will mate for life and remain faithful - parrot pairs stay together until the end . "
" it is really sweet to watch , " she added .
" they spend every minute of every day together , the male looking after the female and feeding her and sitting together on their perches . "
people can learn from parrot courtships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm sorry polly , there 's someone else " some birds , however , are quicker to jump on the monogamy wagon than others .
" i do n't have to do much other than make the introductions , some birds experience love at first sight , while others make a really careful choice before entering a relationship and need to be talked into it with a complicated courtship , " ohnhäuser said .
" it can take up to three months of being given the best bird seed or even building an elaborate nest to entice a reluctant partner . "
if we humans are forced to abandon our hermetically-sealed , web-connected lives in favor of the great outdoors in a bid to save our race , there can be few better blueprints for survival than that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say they oppose the mosque purely on the grounds that there are no muslims in the neighborhood and therefore no need for a mosque .
others say they fear an " islamization " of the area , and that the new building will turn a quiet part of berlin into a racial trouble-spot . muslim authorities argue that the mosque near the city 's tegel airport had become too crowded and that land in pankow-heinersdorf , which used to belong to the communist east german state , was cheap . neo-nazi backlash mosques are common in western berlin with its large turkish community , but this is the first to go up in the east of the city . the mosque is due to open in august 2008 in a former mustard factory in the tinius strasse to the 250 members of berlin 's ahmadiyya community , which is categorized by german authorities as tolerant and open-minded . but german authorities are concerned it will trigger a rise in right-wing extremism , particularly in the economically depressed east of the country where the ultra-right national democratic party has gained support in recent elections . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
finding love seems to be getting increasingly difficult in the modern age .
while lonely humans turn to internet dating agencies in search of companionship , lovesick parrots turn to a dedicated german relationship expert . one of the major disadvantages of the internet explosion has been the gradual breakdown of community and human-to-human contact .
with everything at our fingertips , humans are slowly losing their ability to live in the real world and to interact with each other without the use of a keyboard and screen .
perversely , humans who spend most of their lives online look to the internet to help solve their web-inspired loneliness .
online dating agencies have exploded exponentially with the number of lonely hearts looking for love on the information superhighway , in turn creating a virtual mating community for those who do n't get out as much as they should .
humans isolating themselves with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not real , you know some experts have lamented the fact that the more technical our lives become , the more difficult we are making things for ourselves .
some even talk of a critical mass when technology hinders us to such an extent that the only option left is to return to our most basic selves , essentially going back to nature and doing what comes naturally to the animals , birds and bees .
these anthropologists , however , fail to realize that the beasts of the field also have their problems .
while they don ’ t have to deal with internet-related isolation , they do sometimes need a helping hand to reproduce .
unable to type with clunky claws and bended beaks , parrots especially have a hard time finding a mate .
which is where german parrot whisperer rita ohnhäuser steps in .
ohnhäuser recently celebrated bringing together her 2,000th pair of parrots through her avian dating agency based in schönefeld just outside berlin .
satisfying work finding mates for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " who 's a pretty boy then ? "
" i realized there was a gap in the market because i had so many people asking me about finding a partner for their birds , " the bird sanctuary owner said .
" my work is very satisfying , as parrots , like swans , will mate for life and remain faithful - parrot pairs stay together until the end . "
" it is really sweet to watch , " she added .
" they spend every minute of every day together , the male looking after the female and feeding her and sitting together on their perches . "
people can learn from parrot courtships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm sorry polly , there 's someone else " some birds , however , are quicker to jump on the monogamy wagon than others .
" i do n't have to do much other than make the introductions , some birds experience love at first sight , while others make a really careful choice before entering a relationship and need to be talked into it with a complicated courtship , " ohnhäuser said .
" it can take up to three months of being given the best bird seed or even building an elaborate nest to entice a reluctant partner . "
if we humans are forced to abandon our hermetically-sealed , web-connected lives in favor of the great outdoors in a bid to save our race , there can be few better blueprints for survival than that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 12.07.2007 integrating foreigners an ongoing challenge for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is likely to remain a hot topic for years to come chancellor merkel hosts the second national integration summit on thursday .
but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .
" it ’ s a very slow , incremental process , " he said .

but it will take more than meetings to reverse decades of government disinterest in integration , according to experts . the german government has spent the past year working with immigrant groups and independent experts on a national integration plan to be finalized at this week 's integration summit on thursday .
an estimated 15 million people in germany have an immigrant background , and chancellor angela merkel 's " grand coalition " of social democrats and christian conservatives sees integration as crucial to the country 's future security and economic well-being .
but discussions over the past year have shown that germany has a long way to go before immigrants feel included in society .
in the course of forming an integration plan , few novel ideas have surfaced .
and new immigration rules have led several key turkish groups to boycott the summit , which got underway without them thursday in berlin .
integration debate changes tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the 2006 integration summit for decades , politicians have insisted that germany is not an immigration country , but merkel 's focus on integration points to an important shift in german politics , said simon green , a professor at the institute for german studies at the university of birmingham in the united kingdom and a leading expert on integration .
" it 's been really important the conservatives stop talking about germany not being a country of immigration , " green said .
" there 's been a recognition that immigration is a good thing for germany and that germany needs it .
that has helped change the overall societal tone . "
yet , germany is not on track to becoming a paradise of multiculturalism . " the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " maria böhmer , germany 's commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said wednesday . böhmer has stressed the importance of immigrants accepting the values and laws of the country that they move to , adding that immigrants need to learn basic german and participate in integration courses . integration or assimilation ? most of the time , when germany and other european countries have talked about promoting integration , they really want voluntary assimilation , green said , pointing out that integration involves both parties moving toward each other while only one group changes through assimilation : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners who learn german find it easier to integrate daily life expecting immigrants to voluntarily accept a culture 's values and do things such as learn the language is n't necessarily unreasonable but requires effort from both sides , green added .
" it 's not the type of thing where you can be integrated by default .
it 's go to be voluntary and it 's got to be active . " he said . six working groups were organized last year to analyze the problems of immigrants propose ways of actively integrating them into german society through the national integration plan , which will include some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to foster integration . one year later : a first step bülent arslan , a cdu member and director of the institute for intercultural management and political consulting , called this week 's integration summit an important signal that political attitudes towards immigration were changing and that actions would follow prolonged political debate . as a member of one of the official working groups looking at how sports can be used in integration , arslan said the ideas being presented at the integration summit is only the start of what needs to be done to improve integration . " i think a lot more needs to come , " he said .
" this summit is only a beginning . " charges of discrimination the chances for success , however , decreased wednesday when four important turkish groups declared that they would not attend this year 's summit , even though turkish leaders last year hailed last year 's meeting as a " new era of immigration policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish groups have been upset by recent immigration laws the groups are particularly angry over recent changes to a 2005 immigration law .
foreign spouses who want to join their non-german partners are now required to speak basic german and have financial means to support themselves . the german government has said the law is necessary to prevent forced marriages , but turkish leaders say they were not consulted before the changes were made and that the law discriminates against them .
" this is a statutory legalization of ethnic discrimination , " said bekir alboga of the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , adding that the new law creates parallel societies in germany .
" stefan and thomas will be treated differently than ali . " with about 2.5 million turkish immigrants in germany , the turkish community 's buy in is seen as crucial to a successful integration policy . long , complex process of change arslan said he finds the boycott unfortunate , but thinks it will play " almost no role " in the upcoming summit , adding that only four out of dozens of invitees have refused to attend the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achieving integration is a slow process that can take decades integration is a long , complex process and while the summit sends important signals that the issue is a priority of the government , other factors such as low unemployment and an educational system that does n't leave immigrants behind , play an equally important role , green said . if the economy continues to do well and the educational system improves , " there ’ s no reason why there shouldn ’ t be more progress with integration in german society , " he said .
not just germany but all of europe is struggling with how to best integrate immigrant populations .
it will take a generation before the results of integration efforts would be seen , green predicted .
" it ’ s a very slow , incremental process , " he said .

the 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available - which merkel said was the first in germany 's post-second world war history .
the summit , however , was held under a cloud after four major turkish groups boycotted the event in protest at legislation passed last week which raises the hurdles for newly wed turkish citizens moving to germany to live with their spouses .
discriminatory law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear immigrants will become more marginalised under the new law , husbands or wives of immigrants living in germany can only obtain permanent residency in the country if they are aged 18 or over and can speak between 200 and 300 words of german .
the law is widely seen as an attempt at stamping out the practice of forced marriages on german soil .
merkel rebuked the turkish groups which boycotted the summit and denied claims that the legislation treated muslims differently from anyone else .
she said the law had implemented an eu guideline and included a wide range of exemptions .
" one does not issue the federal government with ultimatums over legislation that has been approved by parliament , " the conservative chancellor told reporters at the end of the one-day conference .
" but we continue to hold out our hand , all they have to do is accept the next invitation when it comes up . "
the chancellor said that the next integration summit would be held in autumn 2008 to assess progress .
" we have a lot to do , " merkel said .
" we invite everyone to get involved once again . "
heated debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , merkel and böhmer brush up on their lines kenan kolat , chairman of a secular association , turkish community - which rejected the invitation to attend the berlin summit along with the ditib network of mosques , the turkish parents ' association and the council of germans of turkish extraction - said in a television interview that his group would challenge the legislation as discriminatory in germany 's constitutional court after it had been gazetted into law .
" the turkish community is not taken seriously , " kolat said . " we are treated like children who understand nothing of the law . "
he added that the new legislation did not apply across the board but sought to turn some immigrants into " second-class citizens . "
citizens of eu member states and other countries that do not need a visa to travel to germany , including australia , israel , japan and the united states , have been exempted from the new immigration regulation .
bekir alboga , the leader of ditib , said he was happy to talk about integration but had boycotted the berlin meeting in protest at the immigration act .
" we have nothing against pursuing a dialogue but we are very much against the immigration law , " alboga told the press .
" it has made second-class citizens of many foreigners . "
" somebody called hans can bring his wife from turkey or india into the country without a problem , but if your name is ali and you have turkish roots , then this becomes a lot harder , " he said .
new education and sponsorship measures agreed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan includes expanded education and german courses earlier on wednesday , the german government approved a package of 150 measures to bring immigrant communities into mainstream german society , including an expansion of cut-price german-language courses .
the length of time that each immigrant can attend such a course was increased by 50 percent .
private language schools and non-profits , which obtain federal grants to conduct the courses , must also provide baby-sitting services for mothers while they learn german and there will be extra grants to train the illiterate and difficult-to-educate teenagers .
maria böhmer , federal migration commissioner , said such classes had been a big success so far , with two thirds of the students being women .
the federal government also aims to set up a network of sponsors to help immigrant families .
germany has a population of nearly 82 million , of whom 7.3 million are not german citizens , according to official statistics .
but the federal government estimates that ethnic minorities total 15 million people , including those who have obtained german citizenship by naturalization or because they were children of mixed marriages between a german and a foreigner .
minorities in public service amid fears that poor minorities may be radicalized , business leaders also attended the " integration summit . "
they have been pressed to train and employ larger numbers of immigrant youths .
brigitte zypries , germany 's justice minister , said a survey showed there were far too few minority trainees in public services . " a survey in 2005 of trainees in the public services found only 2.1 percent were foreign young people compared with 24 percent in job training overall , " she said .
the public services " clearly " told the summit they would try to improve this .
the cabinet also set a target of creating an additional 10,000 jobs for people of foreign origin by 2010 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the traditional image of margaret and gwendoline davies is of two elderly spinsters living in rural mid wales .
but a new exhibition in cardiff shows them as adventurous travellers at the cutting edge of the art scene .
the sisters , who left more than 250 works to the national museum , visited places including iraq and jordan .
their extensive collection , which was bequeathed between 1951-63 , featured waterlilies by monet , renoir 's blue lady and la parisienne , rodin 's the kiss and van gogh 's rain at auvers .
it is seen as one of the most important world-class collections of impressionist and post-impressionist art outside paris , although staff do not comment on its potential value .
to mark the museum 's centenary , officials were given access to the davies family archives to find out more about the sisters , and came across diaries , passports , medals and letters .
it was already known the sisters were teetotallers and strictly religious , but researchers found they had studied art history extensively across europe , and served with the red cross during world war i. born in the 1880s , they were the granddaughters of coal magnate david davies , who made his fortune at the ocean coal company , as well as building railways and barry dock .
ann sumner , the museum 's head of fine art , said the new exhibition placed the sisters within the context of their industrial background , featuring pictures and artefacts from the ocean coal company .
she said it was " incredible how much they travelled " both before and after wwi . "
it was very unusual for women to have reached these heights of art history at this time " dr ann sumner " we had thought they travelled a bit but only as occasional tours , " said dr sumner .
" but we have discovered they travelled very regularly , studying art history and making copious notes . "
dr sumner said the sisters toured europe in a chocolate-coloured daimler , and the exhibition featured their diaries , the international travel pass for the car and a suitcase .
" they were far better educated , particularly in art history , than we realised , " she said .
" in 1907 , margaret went to dresden and went to a series of art history lectures ; they went to rome in 1908 and studied art very closely in the city , they were very fond of venice .
" it was very unusual for women to have reached these heights of art history at this time . "
they started acquiring art in 1908 , and other destinations also included greece , monte carlo , egypt and jordan , where they rode into petra on horseback .
' great destruction ' dr sumner said wwi had a " huge impact " on them , as they signed up with the red cross and gwendoline won a serbian medal for her work .
" they had their eyes opened to great destruction and were very much changed by wwi , " she said .
" they lost beloved cousins in the war and they wanted to live in a different way . "
in 1923 , their buying of art slowed and they bought gregynog hall , near newtown , powys , to display their paintings and many people came to see them including prime minister stanley baldwin , but they also lent them widely to other galleries .
the new exhibition , which opens on saturday , also features displays on the gregynog festival and the gregynog press , both of which the sisters set up .
there is also a section on oral history , which collects stories from people who remember gwendoline , who died in 1951 and margaret , who died in 1963 .

' great destruction ' dr sumner said wwi had a " huge impact " on them , as they signed up with the red cross and gwendoline won a serbian medal for her work .
van gogh 's rain at auvers is a highlight of the display " they had their eyes opened to great destruction and were very much changed by wwi , " she said .
" they lost beloved cousins in the war and they wanted to live in a different way . "
in 1923 , their buying of art slowed and they bought gregynog hall , near newtown , powys , to display their paintings and many people came to see them including prime minister stanley baldwin , but they also lent them widely to other galleries .
the new exhibition , which opens on saturday , also features displays on the gregynog festival and the gregynog press , both of which the sisters set up .
there is also a section on oral history , which collects stories from people who remember gwendoline , who died in 1951 and margaret , who died in 1963 .

it will help restore six iron age hill forts , as well as improve paths and manage moorland in the clwydian range and llantysilio mountains .
it is hoped the grant will protect breeding grounds for birds including black and red grouse .
work will cover a 60 sq km area of the mountain ranges .
dan clayton jones , chairman of the hlf in wales said the work would safeguard the area of outstanding natural beauty .
he added : " supporting a project with such far-reaching benefits is a wonderful way to celebrate our 1,500th grant award in wales .
" the natural and human heritage found within the clwydian range and llantysilio mountains is invaluable and this project will not only safeguard it for future generations , but put its welfare in the hands of the community . "
breeding grounds a number of schemes have been undertaken in recent years to improve the growth of heather on the moorland , which has been damaged by 4x4 drivers and motorcyclists .
many birds , including grouse , hen harriers and merlins , use the habitat as a breeding ground and in 2003 environmentalists spent £ 100,000 cutting strips of heather to ensure it grew back more vigorously .
denbighshire councillor sue roberts said : " the natural and historic heritage of the clwydian range and llantysilio mountain are of international importance . "
carwyn jones , the assembly education and culture minister said the grant was excellent news for wales .
he said : " it will bring enormous benefit to the landscape , the historical monuments , the wildlife , the people who live in the area and the many tourists who visit this spectacular part of the country . "
the hlf said the latest grant took its total funding in wales to more than £ 180m .

defend council housing , which is backed by tenants , trade unions and mps , says there has never been a greater need to build more affordable social housing .
more than 1.5 million people on are on waiting lists , it says .
the prime minister has announced that council land could be used for 60,000 new affordable homes across england .
but critics says many of these will be built by private bodies not councils . "
i do n't think anybody wants to see a return to the big old council estates with the private executive estates on the other side of town " yvette cooper , housing minister announcing his plans in the house of commons on wednesday , mr brown promised to " put affordable housing within the reach of not just the few , but the many " .
' blackmailing tenants ' only about 300 new council homes were built in england last year .
campaigners say a key disincentive to building new homes is the requirement for councils to give a large proportion of any income from rent and right-to-buy sales back to the government .
the bbc 's local government correspondent , john andrew , said that in chesterfield , in derbyshire , for example , the council is only allowed to keep a quarter of its right-to-buy income .
alan walter , chairman of defend council housing , told bbc radio five live , he wants to see these restrictions removed .
" government has been taking money out of council housing to subsidise other schemes - private housing included - and then blackmailing council tenants that if we want improvements to our homes and estates we 've got to accept a privatisation option , " he said .
" we 've been rejecting that .
" there are three million council tenants across the uk and we 're demanding the government invests to improve all council house and estates . "
the majority of newly built social housing is now provided by housing associations - not-for-profit , independent businesses funded by government and rental incomes .
the number of homes owned by housing associations is rapidly approaching the number owned by local councils .
but mr walter said these associations were not answerable to tenants - unlike councils .
" we -lrb- council tenants -rrb- are able to hold our landlords to account , we actually elect our landlords , " he said .
' mixed communities ' housing minister yvette cooper said the government 's housing green paper out next week would give local authorities more flexibility to build .
but , she said , it would still require them to work in partnership with others , including housing associations , to provide social housing .
" i do n't think anybody wants to see a return to the big old council estates with the private executive estates on the other side of town , " ms cooper said .
" what we want are mixed communities . "

defend council housing , which is backed by tenants , trade unions and mps , says there has never been a greater need to build more affordable social housing .
more than 1.5 million people on are on waiting lists , it says .
the prime minister has announced that council land could be used for 60,000 new affordable homes across england .
but critics says many of these will be built by private bodies not councils .
i do n't think anybody wants to see a return to the big old council estates with the private executive estates on the other side of town yvette cooper , housing minister announcing his plans in the house of commons on wednesday , mr brown promised to " put affordable housing within the reach of not just the few , but the many " .
' blackmailing tenants ' only about 300 new council homes were built in england last year .
campaigners say a key disincentive to building new homes is the requirement for councils to give a large proportion of any income from rent and right-to-buy sales back to the government .
the bbc 's local government correspondent , john andrew , said that in chesterfield , in derbyshire , for example , the council is only allowed to keep a quarter of its right-to-buy income .
alan walter , chairman of defend council housing , told bbc radio five live , he wants to see these restrictions removed .
" government has been taking money out of council housing to subsidise other schemes - private housing included - and then blackmailing council tenants that if we want improvements to our homes and estates we 've got to accept a privatisation option , " he said .
graph : decline of uk council housing over time " we 've been rejecting that .
" there are three million council tenants across the uk and we 're demanding the government invests to improve all council house and estates . "
the majority of newly built social housing is now provided by housing associations - not-for-profit , independent businesses funded by government and rental incomes .
the number of homes owned by housing associations is rapidly approaching the number owned by local councils .
but mr walter said these associations were not answerable to tenants - unlike councils .
" we -lrb- council tenants -rrb- are able to hold our landlords to account , we actually elect our landlords , " he said .
' mixed communities ' housing minister yvette cooper said the government 's housing green paper out next week would give local authorities more flexibility to build .
but , she said , it would still require them to work in partnership with others , including housing associations , to provide social housing .
" i do n't think anybody wants to see a return to the big old council estates with the private executive estates on the other side of town , " ms cooper said .
" what we want are mixed communities . "

goshawks and peregrine falcons are now extinct as a breeding species in the dark peak area , the royal society for the protection of birds said .
there were 17 recorded attacks in the past year including a female peregrine found dead after being shot twice .
dr mark avery , from the rspb , called for greater punishments for those who deliberately harm birds .
' illegal persecution ' " failure to condemn and tackle illegal persecution is costing the lives of some of our most popular birds , " said dr avery .
he said the government , interest groups and landowners should " take a stand against a totally unacceptable blight on one of the uk 's most important places for people and wildlife " .
the dark peak is the higher area of the peak district mostly in north derbyshire .
large areas are uninhabited with isolated farms and sheep grazing the main land use .
peregrine numbers across the uk have been rising from a low in the 1960s and the rspb estimates there are 1,285 breeding pairs in the country .
there are only 400-450 goshawks pairs breeding in the uk .
dr avery said : " it is shocking to have to report that birds such as goshawks and peregrines are now extinct as breeding species in the north-east peak moors - an appalling state of affairs that can not be allowed to continue . "
the figures were contained in a report entitled peak malpractice update 2007 , a report into the plight of birds of prey in the dark peak .

goshawks and peregrine falcons are now extinct as a breeding species in the dark peak area , the royal society for the protection of birds said .
there were 17 recorded attacks in the past year including a female peregrine found dead after being shot twice .
dr mark avery , from the rspb , called for greater punishments for those who deliberately harm birds .
' illegal persecution ' " failure to condemn and tackle illegal persecution is costing the lives of some of our most popular birds , " said dr avery .
he said the government , interest groups and landowners should " take a stand against a totally unacceptable blight on one of the uk 's most important places for people and wildlife " .
the dark peak is the higher area of the peak district mostly in north derbyshire .
large areas are uninhabited with isolated farms and sheep grazing the main land use .
peregrine numbers across the uk have been rising from a low in the 1960s and the rspb estimates there are 1,285 breeding pairs in the country .
there are only 400-450 goshawks pairs breeding in the uk .
dr avery said : " it is shocking to have to report that birds such as goshawks and peregrines are now extinct as breeding species in the north-east peak moors - an appalling state of affairs that can not be allowed to continue . "
the figures were contained in a report entitled peak malpractice update 2007 , a report into the plight of birds of prey in the dark peak .
